            "The correct answer is <b>Diarrhoea</b>. Colchicine, an anti-inflammatory drug used for the treatment of gout, is known to cause gastrointestinal side effects. The most common and significant of these is diarrhoea, which can occur in up to 80% of patients taking the medication. It can be severe enough to lead to discontinuation of the drug. Therefore, it is crucial that patients starting on colchicine are warned about this potential side effect.<br /><br />Next, we have <b>Heartburn</b>. While heartburn is not a commonly reported side effect of colchicine, it could potentially occur due to its gastrointestinal effects. However, it's less common and less significant than diarrhoea.<br /><br /><b>Chest pain</b> is another option but it is not a typical side effect of colchicine. Chest pain could indicate serious conditions such as myocardial infarction or angina which are not associated with colchicine use. If a patient taking colchicine reports chest pain, other causes should be explored.<br /><br />The fourth option is <b>Sore throat</b>. Although a sore throat isn't a common side effect of colchicine, any new onset sore throat should be evaluated independently as it might indicate an infection rather than being a side effect from medication.<br /><br />Finally, we have <b>Visual disturbance</b>. This isn't typically associated with colchicine use either. Visual disturbances can be caused by many different conditions and medications but aren't usually seen with colchicine.<br /><br />In conclusion, while all these symptoms could potentially manifest in a patient taking any medication including colchicine due to individual variations and co-existing conditions or medications, diarrhoea remains the most important side effect to warn about when initiating therapy with this drug.<br />",

            "The correct answer for long term control of symptoms in a patient with bilateral bronchiectasis is <b>postural drainage</b>. Postural drainage is a technique that uses gravity to help clear mucus from the lungs by positioning the patient so that the affected lung segments are above the trachea. This facilitates mucus clearance and helps reduce the frequency of infections, ultimately improving the patient's quality of life.<br /><br />In contrast, <b>inhaled corticosteroids</b> are not typically recommended for bronchiectasis as they have limited evidence in reducing exacerbations or improving lung function in non-cystic fibrosis bronchiectasis. Inhaled corticosteroids may be considered in patients with coexisting asthma or COPD but should not be used as monotherapy for bronchiectasis.<br /><br /><b>Prophylactic antibiotics</b> can be helpful in some cases of bronchiectasis, particularly when there is evidence of chronic infection with specific organisms such as <i>Pseudomonas aeruginosa</i>. However, their use should be guided by sputum culture results and tailored to individual patients. Long-term antibiotic therapy has potential side effects and risks, including antibiotic resistance, which makes it less desirable than postural drainage as a first-line approach for symptom control.<br /><br /><b>Surgery</b> is generally reserved for patients who have localized disease that is unresponsive to medical therapy or those with severe complications such as life-threatening hemoptysis. It would not be considered the most important intervention for long-term symptom control in a patient with bilateral bronchiectasis.<br /><br />Lastly, <b>mucolytic therapy</b>, which involves using medications to break down thick mucus secretions, can provide symptomatic relief for some patients with bronchiectasis. However, its overall benefit on long-term outcomes remains uncertain and it is not considered the primary method of managing symptoms in bronchiectasis.<br /><br />In summary, postural drainage is the most important intervention for long-term symptom control in a patient with bilateral bronchiectasis.

Clindamycin is an antibiotic belonging to the lincosamide class, and it is commonly used as a second-line treatment for cellulitis when patients are allergic to penicillins or when first-line treatments have failed. One of the most important side-effects to warn patients about when prescribing clindamycin is diarrhoea, which can range from mild to severe and may be associated with <i>Clostridium difficile</i> infection. This infection can lead to pseudomembranous colitis, a potentially life-threatening condition that requires prompt identification and management.<br /><br />Regarding the other options:<br /><br /><b>Heartburn or indigestion</b> can occur with many medications, including antibiotics; however, it is not considered a major concern with clindamycin therapy. While it's important for patients to be aware of potential gastrointestinal side effects, diarrhoea remains the primary concern with this medication.<br /><br /><b>Jaundice</b> is not a common side effect of clindamycin. Jaundice may indicate liver dysfunction or damage, but clindamycin-associated hepatotoxicity is rare. It would not be necessary to specifically warn the patient about jaundice as a side effect of clindamycin.<br /><br /><b>Sore throat, bruising or lethargy</b> are not typical side effects associated with clindamycin use.
