            "<b>Scleritis</b> is correct. An extremely painful and deep red injected eye in a patient with a systemic connective tissue disease such as systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) should raise suspicion of scleritis. Pain on palpating the eye is often present and visual acuity and pupillary responses may be abnormal depending on which parts of the globe are affected and how severe the symptoms are.<br /><br /><b>Acute angle-closure glaucoma</b> (AACG) is incorrect. Although this can cause acute severe ocular pain, patients usually have features of systemic upset such as nausea and vomiting, and visual acuity is reduced from the start, as many patients have blurred vision. Patients may also notice halos around lights and the cornea may appear cloudy on examination. These features are not seen here. Furthermore, hypermetropia increases the risk of AACG, not myopia. Myopia increases the risk of primary open-angle glaucoma.<br /><br /><b>Acute keratitis</b> is incorrect. Although this can cause a painful red eye, since this affects the cornea, patients describe a foreign body-like gritty sensation, blurring of vision, discharge, and photophobia. An examination may reveal a corneal ulcer. These features are not seen here and acute keratitis is also more common in people wearing contact lenses, which is not the case in this scenario.<br /><br /><b>Anterior uveitis</b> is incorrect. This can cause a painful red eye, however, the pain is generally worse when using the eye, such as when reading or moving the eye. As well as this, a ciliary flush is present, which is a ring of red spreading outwards, which is not seen here as the entirety of this patient's eye is deep red and injected. Anterior uveitis may also have a hypopyon present (pus in the anterior chamber leading to a visible level) and the pupil may be small and irregular due to irregular sphincter muscle contraction.<br /><br /><b>Episcleritis</b> is incorrect. Although this can cause acute eye redness in people with systemic connective tissue diseases including SLE, it is classically not painful or less painful than in scleritis. As well as this, the injected vessels are mobile when gentle pressure is applied, which is not the case here.",

        "body": "Degenerative cervical myelopathy (DCM) has a number of risk factors, which include smoking due to its effects on the intervertebral discs, genetics and occupation - those exposing patients to high axial loading [1]. <br /><br />The presentation of DCM is very variable. Early symptoms are often subtle and can vary in severity day to day, making the disease difficult to detect initially. However as a progressive condition, worsening, deteriorating or new symptoms should be a warning sign.<br /><br />DCM symptoms can include any combination of [1]: <br /><ul><li>Pain (affecting the neck, upper or lower limbs)</li><li>Loss of motor function (loss of digital dexterity, preventing simple tasks such as holding a fork or doing up their shirt buttons, arm or leg weakness/stiffness leading to impaired gait and imbalance</li><li>Loss of sensory function causing numbness</li><li>Loss of autonomic function (urinary or faecal incontinence and/or impotence) - these can occur and do not necessarily suggest cauda equina syndrome in the absence of other hallmarks of that condition</li><li>Hoffman's sign: is a reflex test to assess for cervical myelopathy. It is performed by gently flicking one finger on a patient's hand. A positive test results in reflex twitching of the other fingers on the same hand in response to the flick. </li></ul><br />The most common symptoms at presentation of DCM are unknown, but in one series 50% of patients were initially incorrectly diagnosed and sometimes treated for carpal tunnel syndrome [2].<br /><br />An MRI of the cervical spine is the gold standard test where cervical myelopathy is suspected. It may reveal disc degeneration and ligament hypertrophy, with accompanying cord signal change.<br /><br />All patients with degenerative cervical myelopathy should be urgently referred for assessment by specialist spinal services (neurosurgery or orthopaedic spinal surgery). This is due to the importance of early treatment. The timing of surgery is important, as any existing spinal cord damage can be permanent. Early treatment (within 6 months of diagnosis) offers the best chance of a full recovery but at present, most patients are presenting too late. In one study, patients averaged over 5 appointments before diagnosis, representing >2 years. <br /><br />Currently, decompressive surgery is the only effective treatment. It has been shown to prevent disease progression. Close observation is an option for mild stable disease, but anything progressive or more severe requires surgery to prevent further deterioration. Physiotherapy should only be initiated by specialist services, as manipulation can cause more spinal cord damage. <br /><br />References<br />1. Baron EM, Young WF.

            "<b>Parapneumonic effusion</b> is correct. This patient has signs of a pleural effusion given the presence of reduced breath sounds and dullness to percussion. In the assessment of a pleural effusion, it is important to ascertain whether the effusion is a transudate or exudate. This can sometimes be ascertained quite easily by looking at the protein content of the pleural fluid (transudate protein content < 25g/L and exudate protein content > 35g/L). However, in some cases (i.e. protein content 25-35g/L) Light's criteria need to be applied. <br /><br /><div class='alert alert-warning'><b><u>Light's criteria</b> state that a pleural effusion is an exudate if</u>:<br /><ul><li>Effusion lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) level greater than 2/3 the upper limit of serum LDH</li><li>Pleural fluid LDH divided by serum LDH >0.6</li><li>Pleural fluid protein divided by serum protein >0.5</li></ul></div><br />As this patient's pleural LDH is > 3x that of the serum LDH, this pleural effusion is an exudate.

This would cause a transudative effusion secondary to hypoalbuminaemia.

Although a haemothorax can cause an exudative effusion, as seen here, the lack of a history of trauma makes a haemothorax very unlikely.<br /><br /><b>Heart failure</b> is incorrect. This would cause a transudative effusion. Patients with respiratory disease can develop cor pulmonale secondary to raised pulmonary pressures and subsequently features of congestive heart failure. Additionally, the history of ischaemic heart disease could predispose this patient to heart failure. However, the raised LDH makes this unlikely to be the diagnosis.<br /><br /><b>Nephrotic syndrome</b> is incorrect. This would cause a transudative effusion. Although the urea and creatinine are not within normal limits, this is likely to represent a pre-renal or renal kidney injury from the effusion, rather than represent chronic kidney injury or nephrotic syndrome.",
