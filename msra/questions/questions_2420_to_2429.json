            "<b>Central retinal vein occlusion</b> is the correct diagnosis based on the clinical presentation. The patient has classic features of CRVO: sudden painless unilateral vision loss, widespread retinal haemorrhages in all four quadrants (often described as having a 'stormy sunset' appearance), dilated tortuous veins, and optic disc swelling. The patient also has significant risk factors for CRVO including advanced age, hypertension, and diabetes mellitus. CRVO occurs when there is thrombosis of the central retinal vein as it passes through the lamina cribrosa of the optic nerve, leading to venous stasis, haemorrhage, and oedema throughout the entire retina.<br /><br /><b>Branch retinal vein occlusion</b> presents similarly with sudden painless visual loss but affects only a segment of the retina corresponding to the occluded branch vein. In BRVO, haemorrhages and oedema are confined to the area drained by the affected vein, typically in one quadrant, rather than throughout the entire retina as seen in this patient. BRVO typically occurs at arteriovenous crossings where arteries compress underlying veins, especially in patients with atherosclerosis.<br /><br /><b>Central retinal artery occlusion</b> also causes sudden painless vision loss but has distinctly different fundoscopic findings. CRAO typically presents with a pale, ischaemic retina with a cherry-red spot at the fovea due to the contrast between the choroidal circulation visible at the fovea and the surrounding pale retina. Retinal haemorrhages are typically absent in CRAO, unlike the extensive haemorrhages seen in this patient.<br /><br /><b>Anterior ischaemic optic neuropathy</b> presents with sudden painless visual loss and can show optic disc swelling, but lacks the extensive retinal haemorrhages and venous dilation seen in this case. AION is caused by insufficient blood flow to the optic nerve head, resulting in optic disc oedema that is typically sectoral rather than diffuse, and the retinal vessels appear normal.<br /><br /><b>Retinal detachment</b> typically presents with photopsia (flashes of light), floaters, and a peripheral visual field defect that progresses to involve central vision. Patients often describe a 'curtain' or 'shadow' coming across their vision. On fundoscopy, a detached retina appears as an elevated, mobile, grey membrane, without the widespread haemorrhages and venous changes characteristic of CRVO.",

These options help optimise vision but do not actually slow down the progression of cataracts, therefore surgery will eventually be needed.</li><li>Surgery: Surgery is the only effective treatment for cataracts. This involves removing the cloudy lens and replacing this with an artificial one. <span class=\"concept\" data-cid=\"9745\">NICE suggests that referral for surgery should be dependent upon whether a visual impairment is present, impact on quality of life, and patient choice</span>. Also whether both eyes are affected and the possible risks and benefits of surgery should be taken into account.  Prior to cataract surgery, patients should be provided with information on the refractive implications of various types of intraocular lenses. After cataract surgery, patients should be advised on the use of eye drops and eyewear, what to do if vision changes and the management of other ocular problems. Cataract surgery has a high success rate with 85-90% of patients achieving 6/12 corrected vision (on a Snellen chart) postoperatively. </li></ul>\t<br />Complications following surgery<br /><ul><li><span class=\"concept\" data-cid=\"4075\">Posterior capsule opacification</span>: thickening of the lens capsule</li><li>Retinal detachment</li><li>Posterior capsule rupture</li><li><span class=\"concept\" data-cid=\"10758\">Endophthalmitis</span>: inflammation of aqueous and/or vitreous humour</li></ul><br /><CENTER><table><tr><td align = 'left' colspan='2'><a data-fancybox class='fancybox' rel='group' href='https://d32xxyeh8kfs8k.cloudfront.net/images_Passmedicine/pdd136b.jpg'><img class='ajaximage' src='https://d32xxyeh8kfs8k.cloudfront.net/images_Passmedicine/pdd136.jpg'/></a></td></tr><tr><td valign='top' align='left'></td><td align='right'><a data-fancybox class='fancybox lbmagglasslink' rel='group' href='https://d32xxyeh8kfs8k.cloudfront.net/images_Passmedicine/pdd136b.jpg'><img src='https://d32xxyeh8kfs8k.cloudfront.net/css/images/mag_glass.png'/></a></td></tr></table></CENTER><div class='imagetext'>A hypermature age-related cortico-nuclear cataract with a brunescent (brown) nucleus.

            "<b>Add amlodipine</b> is the correct answer. According to NICE guidelines for stable angina, if symptoms are not controlled with a beta-blocker at maximum tolerated dose, the next step is to add a calcium channel blocker. Since the patient is already on a beta-blocker (bisoprolol), a longer-acting dihydropyridine calcium channel blocker such as amlodipine should be added. The combination of a beta-blocker with a dihydropyridine calcium channel blocker provides complementary mechanisms of action for controlling angina. Beta-blockers reduce myocardial oxygen demand by decreasing heart rate and contractility, while dihydropyridine calcium channel blockers cause peripheral and coronary vasodilation. This patient has been optimised on bisoprolol at 10mg daily (maximum dose) but remains symptomatic, making the addition of amlodipine the appropriate next step.<br /><br /><b>Add isosorbide mononitrate</b> is not the most appropriate next step at this stage. Long-acting nitrates are considered third-line agents in the management of stable angina according to NICE guidelines. They should only be considered if the patient cannot tolerate the addition of a calcium channel blocker to a beta-blocker, or vice versa. In this scenario, there is no indication that the patient would not tolerate a calcium channel blocker, so adding a long-acting nitrate would not be the preferred next step.<br /><br /><b>Add ivabradine</b> is not the most appropriate next step. Ivabradine is a heart rate-lowering agent that acts on the sinus node. According to NICE guidelines, it should be considered as an alternative if beta-blockers or calcium channel blockers are contraindicated or not tolerated. It can also be considered as a third-line agent after both beta-blockers and calcium channel blockers have been tried. In this case, the patient has not yet tried a calcium channel blocker, so ivabradine would not be the preferred next step.<br /><br /><b>Add nicorandil</b> is not the most appropriate next step. Nicorandil is a potassium channel activator with nitrate-like effects. Similar to ivabradine and long-acting nitrates, it is considered a third-line agent in the management of stable angina. It should be considered only after both beta-blockers and calcium channel blockers have been tried, or if these agents are contraindicated or not tolerated. In this scenario, adding a calcium channel blocker would be more appropriate before considering nicorandil.<br /><br /><b>Refer for coronary angiography</b> is not the most appropriate next step at this stage. While coronary angiography and potential revascularisation are important considerations in the management of stable angina, NICE guidelines recommend optimising medical therapy first. The patient still has options for medical management, specifically the addition of a calcium channel blocker. Referral for coronary angiography would be more appropriate if the patient remained symptomatic despite optimal medical therapy with at least two anti-anginal medications, or if there were high-risk features suggesting severe coronary disease.",
