            "The correct answer is <b>Abdominal mass palpable in the right iliac fossa</b>. Crohn's disease can affect any part of the gastrointestinal tract from mouth to anus, but it most commonly affects the terminal ileum. This can lead to inflammation and thickening of the bowel wall, leading to the formation of an abdominal mass that can often be palpated in the right iliac fossa. Furthermore, Crohn's disease is characterised by transmural inflammation which may result in complications such as strictures, abscesses or fistulas, which could also contribute to a palpable mass.<br /><br />The option <b>Tenesmus</b>, which refers to a feeling of incomplete defecation, is more characteristic of ulcerative colitis than Crohn's disease. This symptom arises due to inflammation and ulceration of the rectal and sigmoid mucosa found in ulcerative colitis. <br /><br /><b>Bloody diarrhoea</b> is also more common in ulcerative colitis than Crohn's disease. Ulcerative colitis predominantly affects the colon and rectum where it causes continuous areas of inflammation and ulceration leading to bloody diarrhoea. In contrast, while Crohn's disease can cause diarrhoea due to malabsorption, it doesn't typically cause bloody diarrhoea unless there are significant complications such as fissures or fistulas.<br /><br />Similarly, <b>Faecal incontinence</b> is more likely associated with ulcerative colitis than with Crohn's disease. The chronic inflammation and ulceration seen in ulcerative colitis can damage anal sphincters over time leading to faecal incontinence.<br /><br />Finally, <b>Abdominal pain in the left lower quadrant</b> is less likely with Crohn's disease as compared with ulcerative colitis. Pain in this region typically suggests involvement of the descending or sigmoid colon; these regions are usually affected by ulcerative colitis rather than by Crohn's disease which tends to involve primarily the terminal ileum located on right side.<br />",

            "The correct answer is <b>Metabolic alkalosis</b>. Cocaine toxicity does not typically lead to metabolic alkalosis. Instead, it often results in metabolic acidosis due to increased lactate production from tissue ischemia and rhabdomyolysis. This occurs as a result of cocaine's sympathomimetic effects which increase the body's demand for oxygen, leading to tissue hypoxia.<br /><br />The incorrect options are all commonly associated with cocaine use:<br /><br /><b>Hyperthermia</b> is a common symptom of cocaine toxicity. It results from the drug's stimulatory effect on the central nervous system, which increases muscular activity and heat production. Additionally, cocaine can impair the body's ability to dissipate heat by causing vasoconstriction.<br /><br /><b>Psychosis</b> is a well-documented psychiatric complication of cocaine use. Cocaine induces psychosis by increasing dopamine levels in the brain. Dopamine is a neurotransmitter that plays key roles in reward, motivation, memory, and psychotic symptoms.<br /><br /><b>Rhabdomyolysis</b>, or breakdown of muscle tissue, is another potential consequence of cocaine toxicity. This occurs due to increased muscle activity and hyperthermia caused by the drug's stimulant effects on the central nervous system. The damaged muscle cells release their contents into the bloodstream, including myoglobin which can cause kidney damage if present in high amounts.<br /><br />Finally, <b>Seizures</b> are also associated with cocaine toxicity.

            "<b>Refer to gynaecology</b> is the correct answer. This patient's history is highly suggestive of secondary dysmenorrhoea. Key features include the onset of dysmenorrhoea in her late 30s after previously pain-free periods, and the pain starting several days before the onset of menstruation. Secondary dysmenorrhoea implies an underlying pelvic pathology, such as endometriosis, adenomyosis, fibroids, or pelvic inflammatory disease. A normal pelvic examination does not exclude these conditions, particularly endometriosis or adenomyosis, which may not have palpable signs in the early stages. According to NICE CKS guidelines, all women with suspected secondary dysmenorrhoea should be referred to a gynaecologist for further investigation to establish a diagnosis and formulate a management plan. This referral allows for access to specialist imaging (like transvaginal ultrasound or MRI) and potentially diagnostic laparoscopy, which are beyond the scope of primary care.<br /><br /><b>Arrange pelvic ultrasound scan</b> is a plausible step, as it is a key investigation for pelvic pathology like fibroids or adenomyosis. However, the definitive management pathway recommended by NICE is referral to a specialist service. The gynaecologist is best placed to request and interpret the most appropriate imaging in the context of the clinical picture, and to correlate findings with other potential investigations like laparoscopy. A normal ultrasound scan does not exclude endometriosis, which is a common cause of secondary dysmenorrhoea. Therefore, referring to the specialist who can oversee the entire diagnostic process is the most appropriate single next step for the GP.<br /><br /><b>Prescribe mefenamic acid</b> is incorrect. Mefenamic acid, a non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID), is a first-line treatment for primary dysmenorrhoea, where there is no underlying pathology. While it may offer some symptomatic relief for this patient, initiating it without investigating the cause of her suspected secondary dysmenorrhoea would be inappropriate. The priority is to diagnose the underlying condition, as treatments are often pathology-specific and delaying diagnosis can allow conditions like endometriosis to progress.<br /><br /><b>Prescribe combined oral contraceptive pill</b> is also incorrect. The combined oral contraceptive pill is a second-line treatment option for primary dysmenorrhoea. Similar to prescribing an NSAID, this would be a symptomatic treatment that could mask the signs of an underlying pathology. It is not the appropriate first-line management step when secondary dysmenorrhoea is suspected. The underlying cause must be investigated first before commencing long-term hormonal treatment.<br /><br /><b>Reassure and advise review in 3 months</b> is inappropriate and potentially unsafe. The patient has new, worsening symptoms that are characteristic of secondary dysmenorrhoea. This represents a 'red flag' for underlying pelvic pathology. Providing reassurance without investigation would delay diagnosis and management, potentially leading to worsening pain, subfertility, and progression of the underlying disease.

            "<b>Sensorineural hearing loss</b> is the correct answer as it is the most common long-term complication following bacterial meningitis, affecting up to 20% of survivors. The pathogenesis involves the extension of inflammation from the meninges into the inner ear via the cochlear aqueduct, leading to labyrinthitis and subsequent damage to the delicate hair cells within the cochlea or the cochlear nerve itself. The hearing loss can be unilateral or bilateral and range from mild to profound. The patient's symptom of difficulty understanding speech in noisy environments is a classic presentation of sensorineural hearing loss. Due to its high incidence, UK guidelines (NICE) recommend that all individuals who have had bacterial meningitis undergo a formal audiological assessment. This should happen as soon as they are well enough, ideally before hospital discharge or within four weeks, to allow for early intervention such as hearing aids or cochlear implantation if required.<br /><br />A <b>Cerebral abscess</b> is a rare but very serious complication of meningitis. It would typically present with signs of a space-occupying lesion and ongoing infection, such as persistent fever, severe headache, focal neurological deficits (e.g., limb weakness), or seizures. The patient in this scenario reports feeling generally well and has an unremarkable examination, making a cerebral abscess highly improbable. This diagnosis should be considered in a post-meningitis patient who deteriorates or develops new focal neurology, not in one who is recovering well with an isolated symptom.<br /><br /><b>Epilepsy</b> is a recognised sequela of bacterial meningitis, caused by cortical scarring and neuronal damage. While seizures can occur during the acute illness, the development of long-term epilepsy is less common than hearing loss. The patient has not reported any events suggestive of a seizure, such as tonic-clonic movements, absences, or focal motor activity. Therefore, while a possible long-term risk, it is not the most likely explanation for their current presentation.<br /><br /><b>Hydrocephalus</b> can result from meningitis due to inflammatory exudate and adhesions obstructing the flow or reabsorption of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF). This leads to raised intracranial pressure, which would manifest with symptoms such as a progressive headache (typically worse on waking), nausea, vomiting, visual disturbances (e.g., papilloedema), and altered mental state. This patient's symptoms are specifically related to hearing, and there are no features to suggest raised intracranial pressure, making hydrocephalus an unlikely diagnosis.<br /><br /><b>Adrenal insufficiency</b> in this context relates to Waterhouse-Friderichsen syndrome, a catastrophic complication of severe meningococcal septicaemia involving bilateral adrenal haemorrhage. This is an acute, life-threatening event that occurs during the initial illness, presenting with profound circulatory collapse and shock. It is not a late complication that would develop weeks after a patient has recovered and been discharged from hospital. This patient is clinically well, which is inconsistent with this diagnosis.",
