This patient has blood tests suggestive of renal impairment, as shown by the increased urea and creatinine, which may be due to his history of type 2 diabetes mellitus (which can cause diabetic nephropathy). It is important to establish whether the renal impairment is acute or chronic, as their management varies significantly. Chronic renal failure can lead to impaired conversion of 25-hydroxyvitamin D to its active form, which is needed for intestinal calcium absorption. This makes hypocalcaemia a marker that suggests the kidney disease is chronic and not acute, as an acute kidney injury is not associated with hypocalcaemia. <br /><br /><b>Anuria</b> is incorrect. Most patients with chronic kidney disease are asymptomatic until very late-stage renal disease occurs and at this point, they would manifest other symptoms alongside such as oedema, anaemia, pruritus etc. The presence of oliguria is more suggestive of an acute kidney injury in this scenario as it is unlikely for him to have progressed this far with his chronic kidney disease in the absence of other symptoms.<br /><br /><b>Haematuria</b> is incorrect.

It would not cause otalgia.<br /><br />Eczema herpeticum is a severe primary infection by herpes-simplex-virus 1 or 2, commonly seen in children with atopic eczema.  Presentation with rapidly progressing painful rash (monomorphic punched out lesions 1-3mm in diameter), lymphadenopathy and fever.<br /><br />Guttate psoriasis commonly affects children after <i> Streptococcal </i> upper respiratory tract infection and will clear over the course of ~3 months without treatment.  Presentation is with widespread, rain-drop like lesions across the trunk.<br /><br />Irritant dermatitis is unlikely to cause such focal areas of irritation.",

His FEV1 is 62% predicted, classifying his COPD as moderate severity. According to the NICE COPD guidelines, a short-acting beta-2 agonist (SABA) such as salbutamol or a short-acting muscarinic antagonist (SAMA) should be the first-line pharmacological treatment for COPD. This is recommended as initial therapy regardless of disease severity to provide symptom relief as needed.

While long-acting muscarinic antagonists (LAMAs) like tiotropium are effective bronchodilators in COPD, they are typically recommended as step-up therapy when patients remain symptomatic despite using short-acting bronchodilators. Starting with a LAMA before trying a SABA would skip a step in the recommended treatment pathway and would not align with cost-effective prescribing principles.<br /><br /><b>Salmeterol inhaler twice daily</b> is incorrect as initial therapy. Long-acting beta-2 agonists (LABAs) like salmeterol are recommended as step-up therapy in COPD, typically after short-acting bronchodilators have been tried.

            "The correct answer is <b>Right coronary artery</b>. The ECG findings of ST-segment elevation in leads II, III, and aVF are characteristic of an acute ST-elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI) affecting the inferior wall of the left ventricle. In approximately 85% of the population (a 'right-dominant' circulation), the inferior wall is supplied by the posterior descending artery (PDA), which is a terminal branch of the right coronary artery (RCA). Therefore, occlusion of the RCA is the most common cause of an inferior STEMI. The clinical presentation with nausea is also highly suggestive of an inferior MI, as vagal nerve stimulation from ischaemia of the inferior myocardium is common. The RCA also supplies the sinoatrial (SA) node (in ~60% of people) and the atrioventricular (AV) node (in ~90% of people). Consequently, patients with an RCA occlusion can present with bradycardia, sinus arrest, or varying degrees of AV block, which is an important clinical association to recognise. While the patient is currently haemodynamically stable, close monitoring for these complications is essential.<br /><br /><b>Left anterior descending artery</b> occlusion is incorrect. The left anterior descending (LAD) artery primarily supplies the anterior wall of the left ventricle and the interventricular septum. An occlusion of the LAD would typically manifest as ST-segment elevation in the anterior and septal leads on a 12-lead ECG. This would include leads V1-V4 for an anteroseptal infarct, or more extensively V1-V6, I, and aVL for a large anterior infarct. The ECG findings in this scenario (ST elevation in II, III, aVF) do not correspond to the LAD territory, making this diagnosis unlikely.<br /><br /><b>Left circumflex artery</b> occlusion is incorrect. The left circumflex (LCx) artery supplies the lateral wall of the left ventricle. Occlusion of the LCx typically causes ST-segment elevation in the lateral leads: I, aVL, V5, and V6. In some cases, an LCx occlusion can cause a 'silent' posterior MI, which may present with reciprocal ST depression in leads V1-V3. A posterior ECG (with leads V7-V9) would be required to confirm ST elevation. In a minority of individuals with a 'left-dominant' circulation (~10%), the LCx gives rise to the PDA, and its occlusion could cause an inferior STEMI. However, this is far less common than an RCA occlusion, making the RCA the most likely affected vessel.<br /><br /><b>Left main stem artery</b> occlusion is incorrect. The left main stem (LMS) artery bifurcates into the LAD and LCx arteries, supplying the majority of the left ventricle. A significant LMS occlusion is a life-threatening emergency, often referred to as a 'widow-maker' lesion. It typically results in widespread ST depression across multiple leads with concomitant ST elevation in lead aVR. Patients with a critical LMS occlusion are usually profoundly unwell and in cardiogenic shock. The patient in this scenario is described as haemodynamically stable with localised inferior ECG changes, making an LMS occlusion highly improbable.<br /><br /><b>Posterior descending artery</b> is an incorrect option, although it is a plausible distractor. The posterior descending artery (PDA) does indeed supply the inferior wall of the heart, and its occlusion is the direct cause of the infarction. However, the PDA is a branch vessel, not one of the primary coronary arteries. In the majority of people (right-dominant circulation), the PDA arises from the right coronary artery. Therefore, the underlying pathology is an occlusion of the RCA proximal to the origin of the PDA. The question asks for the most likely coronary artery affected, and the RCA is the main vessel that has been occluded.",

            "The correct answer is <b>Seborrhoeic keratoses</b>. This man has multiple seborrhoeic keratoses, also known as basal cell papillomas.<br /><br />Seborrhoeic keratoses are benign skin lesions that commonly occur in older individuals. They present as well-defined, waxy, 'stuck-on' papules or plaques with a variable colour ranging from light tan to dark brown. The surface of these lesions can be smooth or rough and may show keratotic plugs. They can appear anywhere on the body except the palms and soles.<br /><br /><b>Bowen's disease</b>, also known as squamous cell carcinoma in situ, is incorrect because this condition typically presents as a single, slow-growing, erythematous, scaly patch or plaque with well-defined borders. It doesn't usually appear as multiple lesions like the ones shown in the image.<br /><br /><b>Multiple benign moles</b> is not the correct answer either. While older individuals may have multiple moles (nevi), they generally do not have the 'stuck-on' appearance seen in seborrhoeic keratoses. Moles are typically flat or raised pigmented lesions that are uniform in colour.<br /><br />The diagnosis of <b>Metastatic malignant melanoma</b> is unlikely based on the image. Metastatic melanoma would suggest widespread disease and would likely present with other systemic symptoms such as weight loss or lymphadenopathy. Cutaneous metastases from melanoma often appear as rapidly growing pigmented nodules which are not evident here.<br /><br />Finally, <b>Dysplastic naevus syndrome</b>, also known as familial atypical multiple mole-melanoma (FAMMM) syndrome, is characterised by numerous (>50) atypical moles that vary in size and colour and have irregular borders. People with this syndrome have a high risk of developing malignant melanoma. However, the lesions seen here do not exhibit features typical of dysplastic nevi such as variation in pigmentation and irregular borders.<br />",

            "The correct answer is <b>atorvastatin</b>, as all statins are contraindicated in pregnancy. Although no studies have demonstrated teratogenicity of statins, there are case reports of intrauterine growth restriction and foetal demise in the first trimester in women taking statins. Lipophilic statins such as atorvastatin are able to cross the placenta, achieving similar maternal and foetal concentrations.<br /><br /><b>Clozapine</b> is incorrect, as clozapine is not contraindicated in pregnancy. Clozapine is an atypical antipsychotic used to treat schizophrenia that is unresponsive to first-line medications. The BNF advises clozapine should be used with caution in pregnancy, though it is not contraindicated.<br /><br /><b>Lamotrigine</b> is incorrect, as lamotrigine is not contraindicated in pregnancy. Although many antiepileptic drugs are contraindicated in pregnancy due to teratogenicity, lamotrigine is considered to be safe. It has not been shown to increase the risk of congenital malformations.<br /><br /><b>Low-molecular-weight-heparin</b> is incorrect, as low-molecular-weight-heparin is not contraindicated in pregnancy.
