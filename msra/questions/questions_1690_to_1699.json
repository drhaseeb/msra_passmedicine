            "This patient is displaying signs and symptoms of neuroleptic malignant syndrome (NMS). <br /><br />Amphetamine intoxication can cause alertness, tachycardia, hypotension or hypertension as well as agitation. It is unlikely to cause raised creatine kinase or muscle rigidity. In this scenario amphetamine use is also unlikely as there is no history of drug use and he is under Section 2 of the MHA therefore less likely to have access to drugs. <br /><br />Encephalitis is an important differential diagnosis of confusion and fever. Symptoms may also include headaches, meningism and seizures. Cogwheel rigidity would not be expected in encephalitis.<br /><br />Sepsis is important to consider given the fever, tachycardia and hypotension but sepsis would not cause muscle rigidity or raised creatine kinase. <br /><br />Serotonin syndrome can present in a very similar manner to NMS. One main difference is that serotonin syndrome presents over hours rather than days like in NMS. Serotonin syndrome features include profuse sweating, myoclonus, diarrhoea and hyperreflexia. It does not cause a raised white cell count, bradykinesia or muscle rigidity.",

Cogwheel rigidity is present.<br /><br />Urgent blood tests reveal the following:<br /><br /><div class=\"table-responsive\"><table class = \"tb\" ><tbody><tr><td>Hb</td><td>155 g/L</td><td>Male: (135-180)<br />Female: (115 - 160)</td></tr><tr><td>Platelets</td><td>200 * 10<sup>9</sup>/L</td><td>(150 - 400)</td></tr><tr><td>WBC</td><td>18 * 10<sup>9</sup>/L</td><td>(4.0 - 11.0)</td></tr><tr><td>Creatine Kinase</td><td>2032 <sup>9</sup>/L</td><td>(32-294)</td></tr><tr><td>Na<sup>+</sup></td><td>135 mmol/L</td><td>(135 - 145)</td></tr><tr><td>K<sup>+</sup></td><td>4.9 mmol/L</td><td>(3.5 - 5.0)</td></tr><tr><td>Urea</td><td>3.0 mmol/L</td><td>(2.0 - 7.0)</td></tr><tr><td>Creatinine</td><td>118 \u00b5mol/L</td><td>(55 - 120)</td></tr></tbody></table></div><br />What is the likely cause of his symptoms?",

        "question_notes": "This patient is displaying signs and symptoms of neuroleptic malignant syndrome (NMS). <br /><br />Amphetamine intoxication can cause alertness, tachycardia, hypotension or hypertension as well as agitation. It is unlikely to cause raised creatine kinase or muscle rigidity. In this scenario amphetamine use is also unlikely as there is no history of drug use and he is under Section 2 of the MHA therefore less likely to have access to drugs. <br /><br />Encephalitis is an important differential diagnosis of confusion and fever. Symptoms may also include headaches, meningism and seizures. Cogwheel rigidity would not be expected in encephalitis.<br /><br />Sepsis is important to consider given the fever, tachycardia and hypotension but sepsis would not cause muscle rigidity or raised creatine kinase. <br /><br />Serotonin syndrome can present in a very similar manner to NMS. One main difference is that serotonin syndrome presents over hours rather than days like in NMS. Serotonin syndrome features include profuse sweating, myoclonus, diarrhoea and hyperreflexia. It does not cause a raised white cell count, bradykinesia or muscle rigidity.",

            "Type 2 diabetes is the correct answer. Polydipsia is seen in patients with a fasting plasma glucose of >16.6 mmol/L. The increasing fatigue is also a characteristic symptom. Whilst older patients are at risk of type 2 diabetes, the incidence of type 2 diabetes in children and adolescents is increasing. The elevated fasting plasma glucose points towards diabetes and we can use the C-peptide level to deduce that it is type 2. In type 1 diabetes, we would expect a low or undetectable level of plasma C-peptide due to absolute insulin deficiency. The elevated levels here point towards type 2 diabetes. <br /><br />Acute liver failure is not the correct answer. We would expect signs such as jaundice, coagulopathy, and hepatic encephalopathy. Patients with acute liver failure also tend to be over 40 which doesn't match our patient here. Our patient does also not have a significant intake of alcohol which is a pertinent risk factor for the development of ALF. This patient is also presenting with hyperglycemia and conversely, ALF tends to cause hypoglycemia.<br /><br />Acute pancreatitis is not the correct answer. We would expect to see the characteristic mid epigastric or left upper quadrant pain, which often radiates to the back. Nausea and vomiting are also seen in around 80% of patients. This option would also not explain the polydipsia and C-peptide level.<br /><br />Diabetic ketoacidosis is also incorrect. DKA is an acute metabolic complication of diabetes. It tends to occur in patients with a known diagnosis of type 1 diabetes and will present with nausea and/or vomiting, abdominal pain, and hyperventilation at later stages. Infection is the most common precipitating factor and whilst the recent UTI in our patient supports this, the other aspects of the presentation do not support this differential, such as the low ketone levels.

            "<b>Start low-dose ICS/formoterol regularly and as required</b> is the correct answer. According to the 2024 joint NICE/BTS/SIGN guidelines, the first step for newly diagnosed asthma is a low-dose inhaled corticosteroid (ICS)/formoterol combination inhaler taken as needed for symptom relief (anti-inflammatory reliever or AIR therapy). This patient was started on this regimen. However, their symptoms are not well controlled, as indicated by the need for their reliever more than twice a week and the presence of nocturnal symptoms. This signifies the need to step up treatment. The next step (Step 2) is to move to Maintenance and Reliever Therapy (MART). This involves using the same low-dose ICS/formoterol combination inhaler for both daily maintenance therapy (e.g., one puff twice daily) and for the relief of symptoms as needed. This approach ensures the patient receives an anti-inflammatory dose with every reliever puff, which has been shown to reduce the risk of severe exacerbations compared to traditional SABA-only reliever therapy. The patient's good inhaler technique confirms that poor adherence is not the primary issue, making a change in therapy appropriate.<br /><br /><b>Add a leukotriene receptor antagonist</b> is incorrect. While leukotriene receptor antagonists (LTRAs) like montelukast have a role in asthma management, they are considered at a later stage in the treatment algorithm. According to the 2024 guidelines, an LTRA is considered as an add-on therapy at Step 4, for patients whose asthma is not controlled on moderate-dose MART. Introducing it at this stage would be a deviation from the recommended stepwise approach and is less effective than optimising ICS/LABA therapy first.<br /><br /><b>Add a short-acting beta-2 agonist inhaler</b> is incorrect. This reflects outdated practice. The 2024 guidelines represent a significant shift away from using short-acting beta-2 agonist (SABA) inhalers (like salbutamol) as the primary reliever, especially without concurrent regular ICS use. Over-reliance on SABA for relief is associated with an increased risk of severe asthma exacerbations and mortality. The patient is already on a combination ICS/formoterol inhaler, which should be used as the reliever. Adding a separate SABA would be confusing and counter to modern evidence-based practice.<br /><br /><b>Increase to moderate-dose ICS/formoterol as required</b> is incorrect. The key issue for this patient is the need for regular, maintenance anti-inflammatory treatment, not just a higher dose of reliever therapy. The next step up from as-needed AIR therapy is to introduce a regular maintenance component, which is achieved with low-dose MART. Simply increasing the strength of the as-needed inhaler does not address the underlying inflammation consistently. A move to moderate-dose MART (Step 3) would only be considered if symptoms remain uncontrolled on low-dose MART.<br /><br /><b>Refer to a respiratory specialist</b> is incorrect at this stage. Referral to secondary care is reserved for patients with difficult-to-control asthma, diagnostic uncertainty, or those requiring consideration for biologic therapies. This typically occurs at Step 4 or 5 of the treatment pathway, after trials of moderate-dose MART and add-on therapies (like LTRA or LAMA) have failed. This patient is at an early stage of management, and there are several steps that can be taken in primary care before a specialist opinion is required.",

        "body": "In 2024 NICE, the British Thoracic Society and SIGN produced joint guidelines on the management of asthma following many years of conflicting guidelines. The new guidelines represent a major step change in the management of asthma is both diagnosed and treated.<br /><br />For many years patients with asthma were started on a short-acting beta-2 agonist (SABA) inhaler before 'stepping up' to a regular inhaled corticosteroid with a SABA as required. The new guidelines now advocate the use of combined inhalers (ICS + long-acting beta-2 agonist) as reliever therapy or regularly, depending on the severity of asthma. Given the prevalence of asthma, it is likely that doctors will have to deal with patients on 'conventional' asthma treatments for many years to come. The joint guidelines therefore include guidance on how to manage these patients if their current treatment is controlling their symptoms sufficiently.<br /><br /><h5 class='notes-heading'>Management of adult patients aged children aged \u2265 12 years with newly diagnosed asthma</h5><br />Step 1 <a href='https://www.nice.org.uk/guidance/ng245/chapter/Recommendations#pharmacological-management-in-people-aged-12-and-over:~:text=and%20over.-,Initial%20management%20of%20newly%20diagnosed%20asthma%20in%20people%20aged%2012%20and%20over,-1.7.1' title='NICE - 2024 Asthma: diagnosis, monitoring and chronic asthma management (BTS, NICE, SIGN)' target='_blank' class='badge rounded-pill text-bg-light deeplink'>NICE</a><ul><li>a <span class=\"concept\" data-cid=\"12286\">low-dose inhaled corticosteroid (ICS)/formoterol combination inhaler to be taken as needed for symptom relief</span><ul><li>this is termed anti-inflammatory reliever (AIR) therapy</li></ul></li><li>if the patient presents highly symptomatic (for example, regular nocturnal waking) or with a severe exacerbation:<ul><li><span class=\"concept\" data-cid=\"12295\">start treatment with low-dose MART</span> (maintenance and reliever therapy, see below)</li><li>treat the acute symptoms as appropriate (e.g. a course of oral corticosteroids may be indicated)</li></ul></li></ul><br />Step 2  <a href='https://www.nice.org.uk/guidance/ng245/chapter/Recommendations#pharmacological-management-in-people-aged-12-and-over:~:text=asthma%20management.-,Medicine%20combination%20and%20sequencing%20in%20people%20aged%2012%20and%20over,-For%20guidance%20on' title='NICE - 2024 Asthma: diagnosis, monitoring and chronic asthma management (BTS, NICE, SIGN)' target='_blank' class='badge rounded-pill text-bg-light deeplink'>NICE</a> <br /><ul><li><span class=\"concept\" data-cid=\"12287\">a low-dose MART</span><ul><li>MART describes using an inhaled corticosteroid (ICS)/formoterol combination inhaler for daily maintenance therapy and the relief of symptoms as needed, i.e. regularly and as required</li></ul></li></ul><br />Step 3<br /><ul><li>a <span class=\"concept\" data-cid=\"12288\">moderate-dose MART</span></li></ul><br />Step 4<br /><ul><li><span class=\"concept\" data-cid=\"12289\">check the fractional exhaled nitric oxide (FeNO) level if available, and the blood eosinophil count</span>  <a href='https://www.nice.org.uk/guidance/ng245/chapter/Recommendations#pharmacological-management-in-people-aged-12-and-over:~:text=Check%20the%20fractional%20exhaled%20nitric%20oxide%20(FeNO)%20level%20if%20available' title='NICE - 2024 Asthma: diagnosis, monitoring and chronic asthma management (BTS, NICE, SIGN)' target='_blank' class='badge rounded-pill text-bg-light deeplink'>NICE</a> <ul><li>if <span class=\"concept\" data-cid=\"12290\">either of these is raised, refer to a specialist in asthma care</span></li><li>if <span class=\"concept\" data-cid=\"12291\">neither FeNO nor eosinophil count is raised, consider a trial of either a leukotriene receptor antagonist (LTRA) or a long-acting muscarinic receptor antagonist (LAMA)</span> used in addition to moderate-dose MART</li><li>if control has not improved, stop the LTRA or LAMA and start a trial of the alternative medicine (LTRA or LAMA)</li></ul></li></ul><br />Step 5<br /><ul><li><span class=\"concept\" data-cid=\"12292\">refer people to a specialist in asthma care</span> when asthma is not controlled despite treatment with moderate-dose MART, and trials of an LTRA and a LAMA</li></ul><br /><div class=\"container\"><div class=\"row\"><div class=\"col-md-3\"><a href=\"https://d32xxyeh8kfs8k.cloudfront.net/images_Passmedicine/pdd602b.png\" data-fancybox=\"gallery\" data-caption=\"Algorithm showing pharmacological management of asthma in people aged 12 years and over\"><img  class=\"img-thumbnail mx-auto d-block\" style=\"max-height:150px;margin-bottom:10px;\" src=\"https://d32xxyeh8kfs8k.cloudfront.net/images_Passmedicine/pdd602.png\" alt=\"\" /></a></div></div></div><br /><h5 class='notes-heading'>Transferring people aged 12 and over from other treatment pathways</h5><br />There will be many people whose asthma was managed according to the previous guidelines that present with uncontrolled asthmatic symptoms.

            "<b>Guttate psoriasis</b> is correct. Guttate psoriasis is a subtype of psoriasis that typically affects children and young adults following infection with Streptococcus sp. (as seen here with this patient's recent tonsillitis infection). The rash presents acutely with multiple small scaly and erythematous patches of skin appearing over the trunk and limbs. They often have a tear-drop shape.<br /><br /><b>Disseminated varicella zoster</b> is incorrect. Chickenpox causes a macular, papular, and vesicular rash with crusting of lesions over time. In cases of disseminated chickenpox, there is often cerebral involvement and thrombocytopenia causing purpura which is not seen in this scenario.<br /><br /><b>Pityriasis rosea</b> is incorrect. Pityriasis rosea is a self-limiting rash, characterised by a large round 'herald patch', usually found on the chest, abdomen, or back. It mostly affects children and young adults and is thought to be precipitated by bacterial and viral infections (e.g. human herpes virus 6 and 7).<br /><br /><b>Pityriasis versicolor</b> is incorrect. This is a superficial cutaneous fungal infection caused by Malassezia furfur. The patches can vary in colour from pink and brown to pale (typically paler than the surrounding skin) and therefore explains the name 'versicolor'. The upper limbs and neck are also commonly affected. The rash is usually asymptomatic but can occasionally be itchy. Heat and moisture are risk factors for developing the rash, and the exposure to the heat seems to coincide with this patient's rash.<br /><br /><b>Tinea corporis</b> is incorrect. Tinea corporis is a superficial fungal infection of the skin that can affect any part of the body. However, the infection often spares the hands, feet, scalp, face, and groin. The lesions associated with tinea corporis are characteristic ring-shaped lesions that are not seen here.",

        "question": "A 21-year-old man presents to his general practitioner with a widespread rash over his trunk. He reports that it developed over the past 4 days and is concerned about the appearance. There is no past medical history of note and other than completing a course of phenoxymethylpenicillin for tonsillitis last week, he takes no other regular medications. <br /><br />On examination, there are multiple scaly papules over his trunk and upper limbs. The lesions are small in size and have a tear-drop shape.<br /><br />What is the most likely diagnosis?",

        "title": "Glycosylated haemoglobin",
        "body": "Glycosylated haemoglobin (HbA1c) is the most widely used measure of long-term glycaemic control in diabetes mellitus. HbA1c is produced by the glycosylation of haemoglobin at a rate proportional to the glucose concentration. The level of HbA1c therefore is dependent on:<br /><ul><li>red blood cell lifespan</li><li>average blood glucose concentration</li></ul><br />A number of conditions can interfere with accurate HbA1c interpretation:<br /><br /><div class=\"table-responsive\"><table class = \"tlarge table table-striped table-bordered\"  data-role=\"table\" id=\"tableid1\" ><thead><tr><th><b>Lower-than-expected levels of HbA1c</b> (due to reduced red blood cell lifespan)</th><th><b>Higher-than-expected levels of HbA1c</b> (due to increased red blood cell lifespan)</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td><span class=\"concept\" data-cid=\"3282\">Sickle-cell anaemia</span><br />GP6D deficiency <br /><span class=\"concept\" data-cid=\"3356\">Hereditary spherocytosis</span><br /><span class=\"concept\" data-cid=\"11893\">Haemodialysis</span></td><td>Vitamin B12/folic acid deficiency<br />Iron-deficiency anaemia<br /><span class=\"concept\" data-cid=\"3281\">Splenectomy</span></td></tr></tbody></table></div><br />HbA1c is generally thought to reflect the blood glucose over the previous '3 months' although there is some evidence it is weighed more strongly to glucose levels of the past 2-4 weeks. NICE recommend <i>'HbA1c should be checked every 3-6 months until stable, then 6 monthly'.</i><br /><br />The relationship between HbA1c and average blood glucose is complex but has been studied by the Diabetes Control and Complications Trial (DCCT). A new internationally standardised method for reporting HbA1c has been developed by the International Federation of Clinical Chemistry (IFCC). This will report HbA1c in mmol per mol of haemoglobin without glucose attached.<br /><br /><div class=\"table-responsive\"><table class = \"tlarge table table-striped table-bordered\"  data-role=\"table\" id=\"tableid2\" ><thead><tr><th><b>HBA1c<br />(%)</b></th><th><b>Average plasma glucose<br />(mmol/l)</b></th><th><b>IFCC-HbA1c (mmol/mol)</b></th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>5</td><td>5.5</td></tr><tr><td>6</td><td>7.5</td><td>42</td></tr><tr><td>7</td><td>9.5</td><td>53</td></tr><tr><td>8</td><td>11.5</td><td>64</td></tr><tr><td>9</td><td>13.5</td><td>75</td></tr><tr><td>10</td><td>15.5</td></tr><tr><td>11</td><td>17.5</td></tr><tr><td>12</td><td>19.5</td></tr></tbody></table></div>",

            "This image shows a close-up of a rash on a patient's back. The rash consists of multiple pink, scaly papules which are teardrop in shape. Silver scales can be seen on the lesions. This is a typical image of <b>guttate psoriasis</b>, which is associated with a rash consisting of numerous small patches of psoriasis that develop acutely over several days 1-2 weeks after a streptococcal infection (this patient has just had bacterial tonsillitis, which is typically caused by group A streptococcus infection).  The rash most commonly affects the trunk and limbs. <br /><br /><b>Cutaneous lichen planus</b> is an autoimmune disorder typically resulting in shiny papules or polygonal plaques. Whilst these can be scaly and mildly itchy, unlike the lesions in guttate psoriasis, these are not defining features of the rash in lichen planus. Instead, lesions are often purple and crossed by fine white lines (Wickham's striae). They are most commonly present on the wrist, lower back and ankles. Cutaneous lichen planus is not associated with preceding streptococcal infections. This image does not show typical lesions of cutaneous lichen planus.<br /><br />A <b>drug eruption</b> is a possible diagnosis of a new rash in a patient who has recently taken an antibiotic. Drug eruptions commonly produce a morbilliform rash, a generalised rash with erythematous macules or papules, and may start up to a week after the offending medication has been stopped. However, the rash in this image has the characteristic tear-drop shape and scaly consistency of guttate psoriasis. It is also limited to the trunk and upper limbs, whereas a drug eruption may start on the trunk but then typically becomes more generalised, including upper and lower limbs and the neck. <br /><br /><b>Pityriasis rosea</b> is a key differential diagnosis for guttate psoriasis. Although pityriasis rosea may also be preceded by an infection, it is not as classically associated with streptococcal infections as guttate psoriasis is. In pityriasis rosea, the rash starts with a herald patch, which is followed 1-2 weeks later by multiple erythematous, slightly raised oval lesions. Unlike the lesions of guttate psoriasis, these lesions have a fine scale confined to the outer aspects of the lesion. Furthermore, these lesions often follow a characteristic distribution, running parallel to the lines of Langer and creating a 'fir-tree' appearance. This image is not in keeping with these features of pityriasis rosea. <br /><br /><b>Pityriasis versicolor</b> is a common fungal infection of the skin which results in multiple round or oval (as opposed to droplet-shaped) macules. These can vary in colour from white to pink to red to brown. These lesions often develop insidiously and are not associated with a preceding infection.
