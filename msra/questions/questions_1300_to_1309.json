            "This patient is bradycardic and hypotensive. The ECG findings show a prolonged PR interval in keeping with first-degree heart block. In the management of bradycardia with adverse signs (e.g. shock or heart failure), atropine is used first-line. Atropine is a muscarinic antagonist that acts to increase the heart rate. It can be administered in 500 microgram boluses up to a maximum dose of 3mg. If atropine alone fails to control a patient's bradyarrhythmia, alternative options include isoprenaline infusions or transcutaneous pacing.<br /><br />Intravenous adenosine is used in the treatment of supraventricular tachycardias (normally in the pattern of 6mg &rarr; 12mg &rarr; 12mg). Supraventricular tachycardias are narrow complex tachycardias with a heart rate usually well above 100bpm. In contrast, this patient is bradycardic which suggests this patient has a different diagnosis.<br /><br />An isoprenaline infusion is indicated in the treatment of bradyarrhythmias, particularly if patients fail to respond to initial treatment with atropine. However, the first-line treatment is atropine which has not yet been tried, making atropine the correct answer.<br /><br />Transcutaneous pacing is a method of taking control of pacing a patient's heart by placing pads on the patient's chest. It is indicated for the treatment of bradyarrhythmias without signs of shock (e.g. hypotension). However, it is an alternative treatment for managing bradycardia and is often only indicated following the failure of first-line options such as atropine.<br /><br />Transvenous pacing involves inserting temporary pacing wires through an appropriate vein and passing them up to the right atrium of the heart. It is used as a means of controlling a patient with high-risk bradyarrhythmias (e.g. complete heart block, Mobitz type II), particularly when other methods have failed. However, transvenous pacing is not the most immediate treatment indicated for a patient with bradycardia and shock, unlike atropine.",

            "<b>Measles</b> is the correct diagnosis. This case presents the classic triad of features for measles (rubeola). The illness begins with a prodromal phase, which in this child includes fever and conjunctivitis. Other prodromal symptoms can include coryza and cough (the '3 Cs'). This is followed by the appearance of Koplik spots, which are pathognomonic for measles. These are described in the scenario as 'small white spots...on his buccal mucosa opposite the molar teeth' and typically appear 1-2 days before the rash. Finally, the characteristic morbilliform (maculopapular) rash appears, classically starting behind the ears and on the hairline before spreading caudally to the rest of the body. The combination of these three features \u2013 the prodrome, Koplik spots, and the specific nature and distribution of the rash \u2013 makes measles the most likely diagnosis. Measles is a notifiable disease in the UK, and public health authorities must be informed to manage contacts and prevent outbreaks.<br /><br /><b>Rubella</b>, or German measles, is a key differential for a maculopapular rash in a child. However, the prodrome is typically milder than in measles, or may even be absent. While a rash is present, it is usually a pinker, less blotchy maculopapular eruption that also starts on the face and spreads downwards. The most characteristic clinical sign of rubella is marked posterior auricular and suboccipital lymphadenopathy, which is not mentioned in this case. Conjunctivitis can occur but is less prominent than in measles, and Koplik spots are absent. Forchheimer spots (petechiae on the soft palate) may be seen but are not specific to rubella.<br /><br /><b>Roseola infantum</b> (also known as exanthem subitum) is caused by Human Herpesvirus 6 (HHV-6). The clinical course is very distinct from this presentation. It is characterised by 3-5 days of a very high fever, during which the child often appears surprisingly well. The key diagnostic feature is that the rash appears <i>after</i> the fever has resolved (de-fervescence). The rash typically starts on the trunk and spreads to the neck and limbs, often sparing the face. This patient has a concurrent fever and rash, and the rash distribution is different, making roseola unlikely.<br /><br /><b>Erythema infectiosum</b>, also known as 'slapped cheek syndrome', is caused by Parvovirus B19. The presentation is quite different. It typically begins with a bright red, confluent rash on the cheeks, giving the characteristic 'slapped cheek' appearance. This is followed a few days later by a reticular, lace-like rash on the trunk and limbs. While a mild prodrome of low-grade fever can occur, prominent conjunctivitis and Koplik spots are not features of this illness. The rash distribution and character described in the scenario are inconsistent with erythema infectiosum.<br /><br /><b>Scarlet fever</b> is a bacterial infection caused by an exotoxin-producing strain of <i>Streptococcus pyogenes</i>. It presents with fever, sore throat, and often a 'strawberry tongue' and circumoral pallor. The rash is a fine, punctate erythema that feels like sandpaper to the touch and is most prominent in flexural areas (Pastia's lines). The rash described in this scenario is maculopapular, not the fine, sandpaper-like rash of scarlet fever. Furthermore, Koplik spots are not a feature of scarlet fever. The presence of conjunctivitis also makes this diagnosis less likely.",

This will create a metabolic alkalosis from hydrogen ion loss and hypochloraemia from loss of chloride. Hypokalaemia is a consequence of the process: dehydration and sodium loss stimulates the production of aldosterone via the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system and therefore sodium is reabsorbed at the collecting duct in exchange for potassium, which is lost in the urine. Cushing's syndrome is a distractor since it is well controlled. <br /><br />The option hyperchloraemia, hyperkalemia, and metabolic acidosis is wrong because the patient is losing not acquiring chloride and losing hydrogen ions, leading to alkalosis, not acidosis. <br /><br />Hypokalaemia, hyperchloraemia, and metabolic alkalosis is wrong because the patient is losing not acquiring chloride, causing hypochloraemia. <br /><br />Hypokalaemia, hypocalcemia, and metabolic acidosis is wrong for two reasons.

            "The injury described in the brief is a <b>meniscal tear</b>, which, as in this case, is typically caused by twisting or pivoting. Meniscal tears result in a variety of symptoms including pain (which is often intermittent), locking, catching, and the knee giving way. Swelling usually occurs but develops several hours after the injury. On examination, there is well-localised pain over the joint line (anteromedial or anterolateral), along with varying levels of swelling and reduced mobility. <br /><br />Whilst the <b>anterior cruciate ligament</b> (ACL) may also be injured by sudden twisting movements, an injury of the ACL typically results in a popping noise/popping sensation and is followed by rapid swelling of the knee and an inability to return to full activity. On examination, there is lateral knee and joint line tenderness.<br /><br />Injury to the <b>lateral collateral ligament</b> tends to be caused by a direct blow to the medial knee, which this man has not experienced. The injury will result in an acute onset of lateral knee pain and cessation of activity. On examination, there is swelling of the knee and tenderness over the lateral joint line. <br /><br /><b>Patellar tendon rupture</b> is most common in men under 45 and often occurs during sports. However, a patellar tendon rupture does not result in the features described in this brief. Instead, there will be a sudden onset of anterior knee pain and an inability to straight leg raise or extend the knee. On examination, there will usually be a visible deformity of the patella.<br /><br />Injury of the <b>posterior cruciate ligament</b> is usually caused by a hyperextension injury or by a direct blow to the proximal tibia with the knee in flexion. Typical features are posterior knee pain, mild swelling, and a reduced range of knee flexion.",

Although he was able to finish the game, he now reports that the knee locks intermittently and feels like it might give way. He is also experiencing intermittent knee pain and notes that the joint has started to swell within the last hour.<br /><br />On examination, the left knee joint is swollen, left knee flexion and extension are reduced, and there ie tenderness along the anteromedial joint line. The right knee is unremarkable. <br /><br />What is the diagnosis?",
        "correct_answer": "3",
        "question_notes": "The injury described in the brief is a <b>meniscal tear</b>, which, as in this case, is typically caused by twisting or pivoting. Meniscal tears result in a variety of symptoms including pain (which is often intermittent), locking, catching, and the knee giving way. Swelling usually occurs but develops several hours after the injury. On examination, there is well-localised pain over the joint line (anteromedial or anterolateral), along with varying levels of swelling and reduced mobility. <br /><br />Whilst the <b>anterior cruciate ligament</b> (ACL) may also be injured by sudden twisting movements, an injury of the ACL typically results in a popping noise/popping sensation and is followed by rapid swelling of the knee and an inability to return to full activity. On examination, there is lateral knee and joint line tenderness.<br /><br />Injury to the <b>lateral collateral ligament</b> tends to be caused by a direct blow to the medial knee, which this man has not experienced. The injury will result in an acute onset of lateral knee pain and cessation of activity. On examination, there is swelling of the knee and tenderness over the lateral joint line. <br /><br /><b>Patellar tendon rupture</b> is most common in men under 45 and often occurs during sports. However, a patellar tendon rupture does not result in the features described in this brief. Instead, there will be a sudden onset of anterior knee pain and an inability to straight leg raise or extend the knee. On examination, there will usually be a visible deformity of the patella.<br /><br />Injury of the <b>posterior cruciate ligament</b> is usually caused by a hyperextension injury or by a direct blow to the proximal tibia with the knee in flexion. Typical features are posterior knee pain, mild swelling, and a reduced range of knee flexion.",
