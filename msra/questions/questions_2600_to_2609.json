            "<b>Osteomalacia</b> is the correct diagnosis. This patient presents with the classic triad of bone pain, bone tenderness, and proximal myopathy manifesting as a waddling gait and difficulty climbing stairs. The biochemical profile is characteristic: low calcium, low phosphate, markedly raised alkaline phosphatase, and elevated PTH (secondary hyperparathyroidism developing in response to hypocalcaemia). The history of wearing traditional covering clothing suggests reduced sunlight exposure, a major risk factor for vitamin D deficiency. Osteomalacia results from inadequate mineralisation of bone matrix due to vitamin D deficiency, leading to soft, painful bones. The raised alkaline phosphatase reflects increased osteoblastic activity attempting to compensate for poor mineralisation. The proximal myopathy occurs due to vitamin D's role in muscle function. Treatment involves vitamin D supplementation, typically with a loading dose followed by maintenance therapy, alongside calcium supplementation if dietary intake is inadequate.<br /><br /><b>Osteoporosis</b> typically presents with fragility fractures rather than bone pain and would not cause proximal myopathy or a waddling gait. The biochemical profile would show normal calcium, phosphate, and alkaline phosphatase (unless there is an acute fracture). The markedly elevated alkaline phosphatase and low calcium/phosphate make this diagnosis unlikely.<br /><br /><b>Primary hyperparathyroidism</b> would show elevated calcium (not low), often with low phosphate and raised PTH. Whilst bone pain can occur, the hypocalcaemia in this case excludes primary hyperparathyroidism. The elevated PTH here is secondary to the low calcium, not a primary parathyroid disorder.<br /><br /><b>Polymyalgia rheumatica</b> causes proximal muscle pain and stiffness, particularly affecting shoulders and hips, but would not explain the biochemical abnormalities, bone tenderness, or waddling gait. The alkaline phosphatase would be normal, and the condition typically responds dramatically to corticosteroids.<br /><br /><b>Paget's disease of bone</b> can cause bone pain and markedly elevated alkaline phosphatase, but calcium and phosphate are typically normal. It does not cause proximal myopathy or waddling gait. The disease is usually more localised rather than causing generalised bone pain and tenderness.",
