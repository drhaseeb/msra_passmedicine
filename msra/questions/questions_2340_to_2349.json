Although albumin is also a good measure of the liver's synthetic function, it has a longer half-life than prothrombin and is therefore less useful in acute liver failure. <br /><br />ALT 1465 iu/L is incorrect. Whilst ALT is a good measure of hepatotoxicity in paracetamol poisoning, it is not a measure of synthetic function so is an inferior test for assessing acute liver failure. <br /><br />Creatinine 250 umol/L is incorrect.

        "question_notes": "Prothrombin time (PT) 28 seconds is the correct answer. Prothrombin time is the most accurate determinate of acute liver failure as it is a measurement of the liver's synthetic function.<br /><br />Albumin 30 g/L is incorrect. Although albumin is also a good measure of the liver's synthetic function, it has a longer half-life than prothrombin and is therefore less useful in acute liver failure. <br /><br />ALT 1465 iu/L is incorrect. Whilst ALT is a good measure of hepatotoxicity in paracetamol poisoning, it is not a measure of synthetic function so is an inferior test for assessing acute liver failure. <br /><br />Creatinine 250 umol/L is incorrect. Raised creatinine is a better measure of renal disease.<br /><br />Platelet count 500 * 10<sup>9</sup>/L is incorrect. A raised platelet count can be caused by inflammation and infection. In chronic liver disease, the platelet count may be low.",

        "body": "A scaphoid fracture is a type of wrist fracture, typically arises as a result of a fall onto an outstretched hand (FOOSH). This results in axial compression of the scaphoid, with the wrist hyperextended, and radially deviated. This can also occur during contact sports such as football, or during a road traffic accident due to the patient holding the steering wheel. It is important to examine for scaphoid fractures in anyone presenting with an acutely painful wrist for medico-legal reasons.<br /><br />Recognising scaphoid fractures is particularly important given the unusual blood supply of the scaphoid bone. Around 80% of the blood supply is derived from the <span class=\"concept\" data-cid=\"5352\">dorsal carpal branch (branch of the radial artery)</span>, in a retrograde manner.
