            "The correct answer is <b>Hypoalbuminaemia</b>. Hypoalbuminaemia refers to a low level of albumin in the blood. In the context of burns, it is commonly seen due to loss of plasma proteins including albumin from the burn wound and reduced synthesis due to liver dysfunction. Albumin is vital for maintaining oncotic pressure within the vascular system. If levels fall, fluid will leak into the interstitial space causing oedema, which is likely the cause of lower leg swelling in this patient.<br /><br /><b>Iliofemoral deep vein thrombosis</b> (DVT) could also lead to oedema in both legs, but it would be unusual for a DVT to occur bilaterally at the same time. Moreover, there are no specific risk factors mentioned in the scenario that would predispose this patient to developing a DVT.<br /><br />The option <b>venous obstruction due to scarring</b> is incorrect because two weeks post-burn injury is too early for significant scarring or contractures that might obstruct venous return.<br /><br /><b>Excessive administration of intravenous fluids</b> can indeed cause peripheral oedema. However, two weeks after sustaining burns, we would expect fluid resuscitation to have been adjusted appropriately based on clinical and biochemical parameters.<br /><br />Finally, <b>None of the above</b> does not apply here as hypoalbuminaemia is indeed a common complication following severe burns and can lead to oedema.",

            "Disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC) is the correct answer. The combination of low platelets, increased clotting time and raised fibrin degradation products (FDPs) in this setting make DIC the most likely diagnosis. The patient underwent a major operation and now developed deranged vital signs which suggest sepsis. One critical mediator of DIC is the release of a transmembrane glycoprotein known as tissue factor. Tissue factor (TF) is present on the surface of many cell types and is not normally in contact with the general circulation, but is exposed to the circulation after vascular damage. For example, TF is released in response to exposure to cytokines (particularly interleukin 1), tumour necrosis factor, and endotoxin. This plays a major role in the development of DIC in septic conditions. <br /><br />Anastomotic leak will usually happen 5 days post-op and the history is rather suggesting a more acute problem. The history and examination findings are not consistent with it.<br /><br />Heparin-induced thrombocytopenia usually happens 5-14 days post-heparin exposure. It occurs due to the immune complex formation between heparin and platelets. The result is a decreased platelet count mainly. The blood results are not consistent with it.<br /><br />Warfarin is a vitamin K antagonist which inhibits factors 2, 7, 9, 10. Warfarin is usually reversed before the surgery to avoid excessive bleeding during the surgery. It is unlikely to cause an increase in FDPs and a decrease in platelets. The blood results are not consistent with it.<br /><br />Although aspirin is an antiplatelet and COX2 inhibitor, a rise of FDP is not seen in aspirin usage. The platelet count will not be affected in aspirin. It will however, result in an increase in bleeding time as platelet function is impaired. The blood results are not consistent with it.",

        "body": "Under normal conditions, clotting and clot breakdown are balanced. Thrombin converts fibrinogen into fibrin to form a stable clot, while the fibrinolytic system generates plasmin to break down fibrin and fibrinogen into fibrin degradation products. Plasmin is central to maintaining this balance.<br /><br />In disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC), this balance is lost, leading to widespread clotting and bleeding. The key trigger is tissue factor (TF), a membrane protein normally hidden from circulation but exposed after vascular injury or in response to cytokines (e.g. IL-1, TNF) and endotoxin, particularly in sepsis. TF is abundant in lung, brain, and placenta, explaining the risk in trauma and obstetric cases.

This is appropriate because the patient's glycaemic control is well within target range for his age and comorbidities.

This patient's HbA1c of 46 mmol/mol (6.4%) represents excellent control, and the small increase from 44 mmol/mol (6.2%) over the past year is clinically insignificant.

            "The most likely diagnosis for this 62-year-old woman presenting with painful 'bruises' on her shins and forearms is <b>Erythema nodosum</b>. Erythema nodosum is a type of panniculitis, or inflammation of the subcutaneous fat. It presents as tender, erythematous nodules typically located on the anterior shins but can also appear on the forearms. The condition may occur spontaneously or be associated with systemic diseases such as sarcoidosis, inflammatory bowel disease or streptococcal infection.<br /><br /><b>Idiopathic thrombocytopenic purpura (ITP)</b> is an autoimmune disorder characterised by low platelet count leading to easy bruising and excessive bleeding. However, the bruises in ITP are usually not painful which makes it less likely in this case.<br /><br /><b>Erythema ab igne</b> is a skin condition caused by prolonged exposure to heat or infrared radiation. It presents as mottled, erythematous patches that can become permanent if exposure continues. Given that the patient does not report any relevant exposures and the lesions are painful rather than asymptomatic, this diagnosis would be less likely.<br /><br /><b>Thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura (TTP)</b> is a rare blood disorder that causes blood clots to form in small blood vessels throughout the body. This can lead to serious problems if left untreated such as kidney failure and stroke. The bruises seen in TTP are similar to those seen in ITP - they are usually not painful and often accompanied by other symptoms like fatigue, fever, confusion which have not been reported in this case.<br /><br />Lastly, <b>Cellulitis</b> is an infection of the deeper layers of skin and underlying tissue. It causes redness and swelling on affected areas of skin which are warm to touch due to inflammation caused by bacteria (most commonly Group A Streptococcus or Staphylococcus aureus). Cellulitis typically affects one side of the body, unlike our case where both shins and forearms are involved hence making it less likely.<br />",
