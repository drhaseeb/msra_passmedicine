            "The most likely diagnosis for this 67-year-old retired builder presenting with red, scaly lesions on his forehead is <b>actinic keratoses</b>. Actinic keratoses are premalignant skin lesions caused by chronic exposure to ultraviolet (UV) radiation, typically seen in fair-skinned individuals and those with a history of outdoor work such as builders. The appearance of these lesions as erythematous, rough patches is consistent with actinic keratoses. In some cases, they can progress to squamous cell carcinoma if left untreated.<br /><br /><b>Pityriasis versicolor</b> is an incorrect answer because it is a superficial fungal infection caused by the yeast <i>Malassezia</i>. It typically presents as hypopigmented or hyperpigmented scaly macules and patches on the trunk and upper extremities. The distribution and lack of pigmentary changes make pityriasis versicolor less likely in this case.<br /><br /><b>Seborrhoeic keratosis</b> is also an incorrect answer. Seborrhoeic keratoses are benign epidermal growths that appear as waxy, brownish-black 'stuck-on' plaques. They commonly occur on the trunk and face but have a different appearance than the erythematous, rough lesions described in this case.<br /><br /><b>Polymorphous light eruption</b> is not the correct answer either. Polymorphous light eruption is a delayed hypersensitivity reaction to UV radiation that presents as pruritic papules, vesicles, or plaques on sun-exposed skin areas shortly after sun exposure. While the patient's age and occupation might suggest sun exposure as a factor, the chronic nature of these lesions makes polymorphous light eruption less likely.<br /><br />Finally, <b>malignant melanoma</b> would be an incorrect answer because malignant melanoma typically presents as an asymmetrical, irregularly bordered, variably coloured lesion with a diameter greater than 6mm.

Gout is a condition characterised by an excess of uric acid in the body, which can form crystals that deposit in joints causing inflammation and pain.

While low-dose aspirin has been associated with increased serum uric acid levels, it does not typically precipitate acute gout attacks like furosemide can. Furthermore, aspirin at higher doses (>3g/day) actually decreases uric acid levels by enhancing its excretion.<br /><br /><b>Metformin</b> is also incorrect. Metformin is an antidiabetic medication that works by decreasing hepatic glucose production and improving insulin sensitivity. There is no evidence to suggest that metformin increases serum uric acid levels or precipitates gout attacks.<br /><br />The option of <b>Finasteride</b>, a 5-alpha-reductase inhibitor used for benign prostatic hyperplasia and male pattern baldness, does not have any known association with increased serum uric acid levels or precipitation of gout attacks.<br /><br />Finally, <b>Ciprofloxacin</b>, a fluoroquinolone antibiotic, has no known link with increasing serum uric acid levels or causing gout flares either.

The management of ACS has evolved over recent years, with the development of new drugs and procedures such as percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI).<br /><br />Emergency departments often have their own protocols based on local factors such as the availability of PCI and hospital drug formularies. The following is based on the 2020 update to the NICE ACS guidelines.<br /><br />Acute coronary syndrome can be classified as follows:<br /><ul><li>ST-elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI): ST-segment elevation + elevated biomarkers of myocardial damage</li><li>non ST-elevation myocardial infarction (NSTEMI): ECG changes but no ST-segment elevation + elevated biomarkers of myocardial damage</li><li>unstable angina</li></ul><br />The management of ACS depends on the particular subtype. NICE management guidance groups the patients into two groups:<br /><ul><li>1. STEMI</li><li>2. NSTEM/unstable angina</li></ul><br /><h5 class='notes-heading'>Common management of all patients with ACS</h5><br />Initial drug therapy<br /><ul><li><span class=\"concept\" data-cid=\"11121\">aspirin 300mg</span></li><li><span class=\"concept\" data-cid=\"11122\">oxygen should only be given if the patient has oxygen saturations < 94%</span> in keeping with British Thoracic Society oxygen therapy guidelines</li><li><span class=\"concept\" data-cid=\"11123\">morphine should only be given for patients with severe pain</span><ul><li>previously IV morphine was given routinely</li><li>evidence, however, suggests that this may be associated with adverse outcomes </li></ul></li><li>nitrates<ul><li>can be given either sublingually or intravenously</li><li>useful if the patient has ongoing chest pain or hypertension</li><li><span class=\"concept\" data-cid=\"11124\">should be used in caution if patient hypotensive</span></li></ul></li></ul><br />The next step in managing a patient with suspected ACS is to determine whether they meet the ECG criteria for STEMI.
