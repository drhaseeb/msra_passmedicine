In <span class=\"concept\" data-cid=\"1261\">post-menopausal women, aromatase inhibitors such as anastrozole</span> are used for this purpose*. This is important as aromatisation accounts for the majority of oestrogen production in post-menopausal women and therefore anastrozole is used for ER +ve breast cancer in this group. <br /><br />Important side effects of tamoxifen include an increased risk of endometrial cancer, venous thromboembolism and menopausal symptoms.<br /><br /><h5 class='notes-heading'>Biological therapy</h5><br />The most common type of biological therapy used for breast cancer is <span class=\"concept\" data-cid=\"3966\">trastuzumab (Herceptin)</span>.

The prevalence of osteoporosis increases from 2% at 50 years to more than 25% at 80 years in women.<br /><br />There are many other risk factors and secondary causes of osteoporosis.

            "<b>Low-dose inhaled corticosteroid/formoterol as required</b> is the correct answer. The 2024 joint NICE/BTS/SIGN guidelines represent a significant change in the initial management of asthma in adults and children aged 12 and over. For patients with newly diagnosed asthma who are not highly symptomatic, the recommended first-line treatment is a low-dose inhaled corticosteroid (ICS) combined with formoterol (a fast-acting long-acting beta-2 agonist, LABA) to be used as needed for symptom relief. This is known as anti-inflammatory reliever (AIR) therapy. The rationale is to ensure that whenever a patient uses their reliever for symptoms, they also receive a dose of anti-inflammatory medication (the ICS). This approach addresses the underlying inflammation of asthma from the outset and has been shown to reduce the risk of severe exacerbations compared to treatment with a short-acting beta-2 agonist (SABA) alone. This patient's infrequent symptoms (twice a month) make him an ideal candidate for this initial step.<br /><br /><b>Short-acting beta-2 agonist as required</b> is incorrect. For many years, a SABA inhaler (e.g., salbutamol) used as needed was the standard first-line treatment for mild, intermittent asthma. However, extensive evidence has demonstrated that reliance on SABA-only treatment does not address the underlying airway inflammation and is associated with an increased risk of severe exacerbations and asthma-related death. The 2024 guidelines have therefore moved away from this practice as a first-line approach. While patients currently well-controlled on a SABA alone may not need to be switched, it is no longer the recommended starting therapy for a new diagnosis.<br /><br /><b>Regular low-dose inhaled corticosteroid</b> is incorrect. Prescribing a regular, daily low-dose ICS with a SABA for relief was the traditional second step in asthma management. While this ensures the patient receives anti-inflammatory treatment, the new guidelines favour the use of a combination ICS/formoterol inhaler from the start. This simplifies the regimen and ensures that reliever use is always coupled with an ICS. For a patient with infrequent symptoms like this, a daily maintenance inhaler may not be necessary, and as-needed AIR therapy is the preferred starting point.<br /><br /><b>Low-dose inhaled corticosteroid/formoterol maintenance and reliever therapy</b> (MART) is incorrect for this patient. MART involves using a combination ICS/formoterol inhaler for both daily maintenance treatment (e.g., one puff twice a day) and as-needed for symptom relief. This is the recommended second step in the new guideline pathway. It is intended for patients who are more symptomatic at diagnosis (e.g., symptoms on three or more days a week, or any nocturnal waking) or for those whose symptoms are not controlled on as-needed AIR therapy alone. As this patient's symptoms are infrequent, starting with as-needed AIR therapy is more appropriate.<br /><br /><b>Regular leukotriene receptor antagonist</b> is incorrect. A leukotriene receptor antagonist (LTRA), such as montelukast, can be an effective treatment for some patients, particularly those with exercise-induced symptoms or concurrent allergic rhinitis. However, it is not recommended as a first-line monotherapy for newly diagnosed asthma. In the new 2024 guideline pathway, an LTRA is considered as a potential add-on therapy at Step 4 for patients whose asthma is not controlled on moderate-dose MART, making it an inappropriate initial choice.",

The new guidelines represent a major step change in the management of asthma is both diagnosed and treated.<br /><br />For many years patients with asthma were started on a short-acting beta-2 agonist (SABA) inhaler before 'stepping up' to a regular inhaled corticosteroid with a SABA as required. The new guidelines now advocate the use of combined inhalers (ICS + long-acting beta-2 agonist) as reliever therapy or regularly, depending on the severity of asthma. Given the prevalence of asthma, it is likely that doctors will have to deal with patients on 'conventional' asthma treatments for many years to come. The joint guidelines therefore include guidance on how to manage these patients if their current treatment is controlling their symptoms sufficiently.<br /><br /><h5 class='notes-heading'>Management of adult patients aged children aged \u2265 12 years with newly diagnosed asthma</h5><br />Step 1 <a href='https://www.nice.org.uk/guidance/ng245/chapter/Recommendations#pharmacological-management-in-people-aged-12-and-over:~:text=and%20over.-,Initial%20management%20of%20newly%20diagnosed%20asthma%20in%20people%20aged%2012%20and%20over,-1.7.1' title='NICE - 2024 Asthma: diagnosis, monitoring and chronic asthma management (BTS, NICE, SIGN)' target='_blank' class='badge rounded-pill text-bg-light deeplink'>NICE</a><ul><li>a <span class=\"concept\" data-cid=\"12286\">low-dose inhaled corticosteroid (ICS)/formoterol combination inhaler to be taken as needed for symptom relief</span><ul><li>this is termed anti-inflammatory reliever (AIR) therapy</li></ul></li><li>if the patient presents highly symptomatic (for example, regular nocturnal waking) or with a severe exacerbation:<ul><li><span class=\"concept\" data-cid=\"12295\">start treatment with low-dose MART</span> (maintenance and reliever therapy, see below)</li><li>treat the acute symptoms as appropriate (e.g. a course of oral corticosteroids may be indicated)</li></ul></li></ul><br />Step 2  <a href='https://www.nice.org.uk/guidance/ng245/chapter/Recommendations#pharmacological-management-in-people-aged-12-and-over:~:text=asthma%20management.-,Medicine%20combination%20and%20sequencing%20in%20people%20aged%2012%20and%20over,-For%20guidance%20on' title='NICE - 2024 Asthma: diagnosis, monitoring and chronic asthma management (BTS, NICE, SIGN)' target='_blank' class='badge rounded-pill text-bg-light deeplink'>NICE</a> <br /><ul><li><span class=\"concept\" data-cid=\"12287\">a low-dose MART</span><ul><li>MART describes using an inhaled corticosteroid (ICS)/formoterol combination inhaler for daily maintenance therapy and the relief of symptoms as needed, i.e. regularly and as required</li></ul></li></ul><br />Step 3<br /><ul><li>a <span class=\"concept\" data-cid=\"12288\">moderate-dose MART</span></li></ul><br />Step 4<br /><ul><li><span class=\"concept\" data-cid=\"12289\">check the fractional exhaled nitric oxide (FeNO) level if available, and the blood eosinophil count</span>  <a href='https://www.nice.org.uk/guidance/ng245/chapter/Recommendations#pharmacological-management-in-people-aged-12-and-over:~:text=Check%20the%20fractional%20exhaled%20nitric%20oxide%20(FeNO)%20level%20if%20available' title='NICE - 2024 Asthma: diagnosis, monitoring and chronic asthma management (BTS, NICE, SIGN)' target='_blank' class='badge rounded-pill text-bg-light deeplink'>NICE</a> <ul><li>if <span class=\"concept\" data-cid=\"12290\">either of these is raised, refer to a specialist in asthma care</span></li><li>if <span class=\"concept\" data-cid=\"12291\">neither FeNO nor eosinophil count is raised, consider a trial of either a leukotriene receptor antagonist (LTRA) or a long-acting muscarinic receptor antagonist (LAMA)</span> used in addition to moderate-dose MART</li><li>if control has not improved, stop the LTRA or LAMA and start a trial of the alternative medicine (LTRA or LAMA)</li></ul></li></ul><br />Step 5<br /><ul><li><span class=\"concept\" data-cid=\"12292\">refer people to a specialist in asthma care</span> when asthma is not controlled despite treatment with moderate-dose MART, and trials of an LTRA and a LAMA</li></ul><br /><div class=\"container\"><div class=\"row\"><div class=\"col-md-3\"><a href=\"https://d32xxyeh8kfs8k.cloudfront.net/images_Passmedicine/pdd602b.png\" data-fancybox=\"gallery\" data-caption=\"Algorithm showing pharmacological management of asthma in people aged 12 years and over\"><img  class=\"img-thumbnail mx-auto d-block\" style=\"max-height:150px;margin-bottom:10px;\" src=\"https://d32xxyeh8kfs8k.cloudfront.net/images_Passmedicine/pdd602.png\" alt=\"\" /></a></div></div></div><br /><h5 class='notes-heading'>Transferring people aged 12 and over from other treatment pathways</h5><br />There will be many people whose asthma was managed according to the previous guidelines that present with uncontrolled asthmatic symptoms.
