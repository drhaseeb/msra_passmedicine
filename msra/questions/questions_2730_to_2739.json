        "body": "NICE updated their guidelines on the management of venous thromboembolism (VTE) in 2020. Some of the key changes include recommending the following:<br /><ul><li>the use of direct oral anticoagulants (DOACs) as first-line treatment for most people with VTE</li><li>the use of DOACs in patients with active cancer, as opposed to low-molecular weight heparin as was the previous recommendation</li><li>outpatient treatment in low-risk pulmonary embolism (PE) patients</li><li>routine cancer screening is no longer recommended following a VTE diagnosis</li></ul><br /><br /><h5 class='notes-heading'>Outpatient treatment in low-risk PE patients</h5><br />Deep vein thrombosis has for a long time been treated on an outpatient condition. In contrast, patients with any form of PE were typically admitted. However, in recent years patients with a new diagnosis of PE who are deemed low-risk are now increasingly managed as outpatients. NICE formally supported this approach in their latest guidance.<br /><ul><li>NICE recommends using a 'validated risk stratification tool' to determine the suitability of outpatient treatment.<ul><li>no guidance is given as to what tool should be used</li><li>the 2018 British Society guidelines support the use of the <span class=\"concept\" data-cid=\"10423\">Pulmonary Embolism Severity Index (PESI) score</span></li></ul></li><li>key requirements would clearly be haemodynamic stability, lack of comorbidities and support at home</li></ul><br /><br /><h5 class='notes-heading'>Anticogulant therapy</h5><br />The cornerstone of VTE management is anticoagulant therapy. This was historically done with warfarin, often preceded by heparin until the INR was stable. However, the development of DOACs, and an evidence base supporting their efficacy, has changed modern management.<br /><br />Choice of anticoagulant<br /><ul><li>the big change in the 2020 guidelines was the increased use of DOACs</li><li>apixaban or rivaroxaban (both DOACs) should be offered first-line following the diagnosis of a PE<ul><li>instead of using low-molecular weight heparin (LMWH) until the diagnosis is confirmed, NICE now advocate using a <span class=\"concept\" data-cid=\"8024\">DOAC once a diagnosis is suspected</span>, with this continued if the diagnosis is confirmed</li><li>if neither apixaban or rivaroxaban are suitable then either LMWH followed by dabigatran or edoxaban OR LMWH followed by a vitamin K antagonist (VKA, i.e. warfarin)</li></ul></li><li>if the patient has active cancer<ul><li>previously LMWH was recommended</li><li>the new guidelines now recommend using a DOAC, unless this is contraindicated</li></ul></li><li>if renal impairment is severe (e.g. < 15/min) then LMWH, unfractionated heparin or LMWH followed by a VKA</li><li>if the patient has antiphospholipid syndrome (specifically 'triple positive' in the guidance) then LMWH followed by a VKA should be used</li></ul><br />Length of anticoagulation<br /><ul><li>all patients should have anticoagulation for at least 3 months</li><li>continuing anticoagulation after this period is partly determined by whether the VTE was provoked or unprovoked<ul><li>a provoked VTE is due to an obvious precipitating event e.g. immobilisation following major surgery. The implication is that this event was transient and the patient is no longer at increased risk</li><li>an unprovoked VTE occurs in the absence of an obvious precipitating event, i.e. there is a possibility that there are unknown factors (e.g. mild thrombophilia) making the patient more at risk from further clots</li></ul></li><li><span class=\"concept\" data-cid=\"8025\">if the  VTE was provoked the treatment is typically stopped after the initial 3 months</span> (3 to 6 months for people with active cancer)</li><li><span class=\"concept\" data-cid=\"8026\">if the VTE was unprovoked then treatment is typically continued for up to 3 further months (i.e. 6 months in total)</span><ul><li>NICE recommend that whether a patient has a total of 3-6 months anticoagulant is based upon balancing  a person's risk of VTE recurrence and their risk of bleeding</li><li>the ORBIT score can be used to help assess the risk of bleeding</li><li>NICE state: '<i>Explain to people with unprovoked DVT or PE and a low bleeding risk that the benefits of continuing anticoagulation treatment are likely to outweigh the risks. </i>'.

            "The correct answer is <b>Spironolactone</b>. Spironolactone is a potassium-sparing diuretic, which means it prevents the kidneys from removing too much potassium. This can lead to hyperkalaemia, a condition characterised by elevated levels of potassium in the blood. The patient's blood results show a high level of potassium (K<sup>+</sup>), which is suggestive of hyperkalaemia. Therefore, Spironolactone would be the most likely medication to cause this result.<br /><br /><b>Sodium bicarbonate</b> is not typically associated with causing hyperkalaemia. Sodium bicarbonate works as an alkalising agent and it's generally used in conditions like metabolic acidosis where there's an excessive amount of acid in the body. It does not directly affect potassium levels.<br /><br /><b>Bendroflumethiazide</b>, on the other hand, is a thiazide diuretic which increases the excretion of sodium and water by inhibiting sodium reabsorption in the distal tubules. This leads to increased excretion of potassium, hence it could potentially cause hypokalaemia (low levels of potassium), rather than hyperkalaemia.<br /><br />Similarly, <b>Furosemide</b> is a loop diuretic that inhibits sodium reabsorption in the ascending limb of Henle's loop leading to increased excretion of sodium and water along with chloride, magnesium and calcium. It also increases potassium excretion so its use may lead to hypokalaemia rather than hyperkalaemia.<br /><br />Finally, <b>St John's Wort</b> is a herbal supplement often used for depression and anxiety disorders.

        "correct_answer": "4",
        "question_notes": "The correct answer is <b>Spironolactone</b>. Spironolactone is a potassium-sparing diuretic, which means it prevents the kidneys from removing too much potassium. This can lead to hyperkalaemia, a condition characterised by elevated levels of potassium in the blood. The patient's blood results show a high level of potassium (K<sup>+</sup>), which is suggestive of hyperkalaemia. Therefore, Spironolactone would be the most likely medication to cause this result.<br /><br /><b>Sodium bicarbonate</b> is not typically associated with causing hyperkalaemia. Sodium bicarbonate works as an alkalising agent and it's generally used in conditions like metabolic acidosis where there's an excessive amount of acid in the body. It does not directly affect potassium levels.<br /><br /><b>Bendroflumethiazide</b>, on the other hand, is a thiazide diuretic which increases the excretion of sodium and water by inhibiting sodium reabsorption in the distal tubules. This leads to increased excretion of potassium, hence it could potentially cause hypokalaemia (low levels of potassium), rather than hyperkalaemia.<br /><br />Similarly, <b>Furosemide</b> is a loop diuretic that inhibits sodium reabsorption in the ascending limb of Henle's loop leading to increased excretion of sodium and water along with chloride, magnesium and calcium. It also increases potassium excretion so its use may lead to hypokalaemia rather than hyperkalaemia.<br /><br />Finally, <b>St John's Wort</b> is a herbal supplement often used for depression and anxiety disorders. It has many potential drug interactions due to its induction of cytochrome P450 enzymes but it does not have any significant effect on serum electrolyte levels including potassium.<br /><br />In conclusion, out of all options given above, only Spironolactone has a known side effect profile that includes hyperkalaemia making it the most likely cause for this patient's abnormal blood result.<br />",

However, other organs or their contents may be diverted in case of need. <br /><br />With bowel stomas, the type method of construction and to a lesser extent the site will be determined by the contents of the bowel. In practice, small bowel stomas should be spouted so that their irritant contents are not in contact with the skin. Colonic stomas do not need to be spouted as their contents are less irritant. <br /><br />In the ideal situation, the site of the stoma should be marked with the patient prior to surgery. Stoma siting is important as it will ultimately influence the ability of the patient to manage their stoma and also reduce the risk of leakage. Leakage of stoma contents and subsequent maceration of the surrounding skin can rapidly progress into a spiralling loss of control of stoma contents. <br /><br /><h5 class='notes-heading'>Types of stomas</h5><br />Rule of thumb:<br /><br /><div class=\"table-responsive\"><table class = \"tlarge table table-striped table-bordered\"  data-role=\"table\" id=\"tableid1\" ><thead><tr><th></th><th><span class=\"concept\" data-cid=\"5484\">Ileostomy</span></th><th><span class=\"concept\" data-cid=\"11358\">Colostomy</span></th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td><b>Location</b></td><td>Right iliac fossa</td><td>Varies, more likely on the left side of the abdomen</td></tr><tr><td><b>Appearance</b></td><td>Spouted</td><td>Flushed</td></tr><tr><td><b>Output</b></td><td>Liquid</td><td>Solid</td></tr></tbody></table></div><br />More detail:<br /><br /><div class=\"table-responsive\"><table class = \"tlarge table table-striped table-bordered\"  data-role=\"table\" id=\"tableid2\" ><thead><tr><th><b>Name of stoma</b></th><th><b>Use</b></th><th><b>Common sites</b></th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Gastrostomy</td><td><ul><li>Gastric decompression or fixation</li><li>Feeding</td><td>Epigastrium</td></tr><tr><td></li></ul>Loop jejunostomy</td><td><ul><li>Seldom used as very high output</li><li>May be used following emergency laparotomy with planned early closure</td><td>Any location according to need</td></tr><tr><td></li></ul>Percutaneous jejunostomy</td><td><ul><li>Usually performed for feeding purposes and site in the proximal bowel</td><td>Usually left upper quadrant</td></tr><tr><td></li></ul><span class=\"concept\" data-cid=\"2264\">Loop ileostomy</span></td><td><ul><li>Defunctioning of colon e.g. following rectal cancer surgery</li><li>Does not decompress colon (if ileocaecal valve competent)</td><td>Usually right iliac fossa</td></tr><tr><td></li></ul>End ilestomy</td><td><ul><li>Usually following complete excision of colon or where ileocolic anastomosis is not planned</li><li>May be used to defunction colon, but reversal is more difficult</td><td>Usually right iliac fossa</td></tr><tr><td></li></ul>End colostomy</td><td>Where a colon is diverted or resected and anastomosis is not primarily achievable or desirable</td><td>Either left or right iliac fossa<br />&nbsp;</td></tr><tr><td><span class=\"concept\" data-cid=\"2263\">Loop colostomy</span></td><td><ul><li>To defunction a distal segment of colon</li><li>Since both lumens are present the distal lumen acts as a vent</td><td>May be located in any region of the abdomen, depending upon colonic segment used</td></tr><tr><td></li></ul>Caecostomy</td><td>Stoma of last resort where loop colostomy is not possible</td><td>Right iliac fossa</td></tr><tr><td>Mucous fistula</td><td><ul><li>To decompress a distal segment of bowel following colonic division or resection</li><li>Where closure of a distal resection margin is not safe or achievable</td><td>May be located in any region of the abdomen according to clinical need</td></tr></tbody></table></div></li></ul><br /><h5 class='notes-heading'>Complications</h5><br />Early complications (days post-op)<br /><ul><li>Bleeding</li><li>Ischaemia/necrosis \u2013 dusky, black stoma (urgent)</li><li><span class=\"concept\" data-cid=\"12438\">Retraction</span> \u2013 stoma sits below skin surface \u2192 leakage, skin irritation</li><li>Peristomal skin irritation \u2013 effluent contact</li><li>High-output stoma (ileostomies) \u2192 dehydration, electrolyte loss</li><li>Infection \u2013 wound or peristomal abscess</li></ul><br />Late complications (weeks\u2013years)<br /><ul><li>Parastomal hernia \u2013 most common long-term</li><li>Stenosis/stricture \u2013 poor effluent flow, obstruction</li><li>Prolapse \u2013 bowel telescopes through stoma</li><li>Chronic retraction \u2013 persistent, hard to fit appliances</li><li>Fistula formation</li><li>Psychological issues \u2013 body image, odour, social impact</li></ul><br />Key points of stoma complications<br /><ul><li>Colostomy: prone to prolapse and hernia</li><li>Ileostomy: risk of high output, electrolyte imbalance</li><li>Urostomy: skin irritation from alkaline urine</li><li>Management: stoma nurse support, appliance fitting, skin care; surgery if severe</li></ul>",

            "<b>Sarcoidosis</b>. This is correct. Sarcoidosis, dubbed by some 'the great imitator', can be difficult to diagnose. Sarcoidosis should be a differential to keep in mind with patients presenting with a persistent cough and a painful shin rash. This rash is most likely erythema nodosum, inflammation of the subcutaneous fat usually found on the shins (but can present on the thighs and forearms). Sarcoidosis can also affect the kidneys, giving hypercalcaemia, the lymphatic system, giving lymphadenopathy, and other organs/systems. It is more common in people of Scandinavian or African descent.<br /><br /><b>Berylliosis</b>. Incorrect, as this condition is caused by exposure to beryllium dust. This is almost always an occupational exposure and is seen in workers of the electronics and metal extraction industries. This man is a baker, so is more likely to suffer from so-called 'Baker's lung' if any occupational condition, which is caused by long-term inspiration of flour.<br /><br /><b>Lung squamous cell carcinoma</b>. Incorrect. While lung cancer is an important differential to check for in a patient with weight loss and a chronic cough, it is unlikely this man has a squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) of the lungs. This is because lung SCC is heavily associated with smoking, which this man has no history of, and isn't typically linked with erythema nodosum. Furthermore, he is a relatively young man, so the age of onset points more towards sarcoidosis. These factors combined, along with the weight loss being fairly small, suggest sarcoidosis over lung SCC.<br /><br /><b><i>Mycoplasma pneumoniae</i></b>. In a patient this age, atypical causes of pneumonia such as <i>Mycoplasma pneumoniae</i> should be suspected. This can present with a dry cough and vague symptoms of feeling generally unwell. However, <i>Mycoplasma pneumoniae</i> is associated more with erythema multiforme than erythema nodosum, the concurrence of which there is only anecdotal evidence for in the literature. Furthermore, while not unheard of, weight loss is unusual in <i>Mycoplasma pneumoniae</i> infection.<br /><br /><b>Primary tuberculosis</b>. While tuberculosis (TB) can cause a cough, weight loss, and erythema nodosum, the stem specifies a Mantoux test is negative. This is a test done to check for TB, and a negative result makes TB unlikely. Furthermore, there is no indication this man is immunocompromised, which is usually when latent TB would opportunistically manifest (usually if the CD4+ count is <350).

            "The correct answer is <b>Oral retinoin</b>. Retinoin, also known as isotretinoin, is a derivative of vitamin A and is highly effective for severe acne that has not responded to other treatments. It works by reducing the production of sebum, which can lead to acne if produced in excess. This patient has evidence of scarring, indicating severe acne that warrants this treatment. According to UK guidelines from the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE), oral retinoin should be considered for individuals with severe acne or acne that is resistant to treatment.<br /><br /><b>Oral doxycycline</b> would not be an appropriate choice in this case because it is another tetracycline antibiotic similar to lymecycline, which the patient has already been taking without success. The lack of response suggests that his acne may be resistant to this class of antibiotics.<br /><br /><b>Oral cyproterone acetate</b> is used primarily in women with signs of hyperandrogenism such as hirsutism (excessive hair growth) or alopecia (hair loss), often in combination with an estrogen as a form of contraceptive. It is not typically used as first-line treatment for male patients with acne due to its feminising side effects.<br /><br /><b>IV retinoin</b> does not exist as a form of treatment for acne. Isotretinoin can have serious side effects when taken orally and these would likely be magnified if it were given intravenously.<br /><br />Finally, <b>topical retinoids</b>, while useful in treating mild-to-moderate acne, are unlikely to be sufficiently potent for this patient's severe condition. Additionally, they carry a risk of skin irritation which could exacerbate any existing inflammation and potentially contribute further to scarring.<br />",

        "question": "A 15-year-old male returns to the dermatology clinic for review. He has a past history of acne and is currently treated with oral lymecycline. There has been no response to treatment and examination reveals evidence of scarring on his face. What is the most suitable treatment?",
        "correct_answer": "3",
        "question_notes": "The correct answer is <b>Oral retinoin</b>. Retinoin, also known as isotretinoin, is a derivative of vitamin A and is highly effective for severe acne that has not responded to other treatments. It works by reducing the production of sebum, which can lead to acne if produced in excess. This patient has evidence of scarring, indicating severe acne that warrants this treatment. According to UK guidelines from the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE), oral retinoin should be considered for individuals with severe acne or acne that is resistant to treatment.<br /><br /><b>Oral doxycycline</b> would not be an appropriate choice in this case because it is another tetracycline antibiotic similar to lymecycline, which the patient has already been taking without success. The lack of response suggests that his acne may be resistant to this class of antibiotics.<br /><br /><b>Oral cyproterone acetate</b> is used primarily in women with signs of hyperandrogenism such as hirsutism (excessive hair growth) or alopecia (hair loss), often in combination with an estrogen as a form of contraceptive. It is not typically used as first-line treatment for male patients with acne due to its feminising side effects.<br /><br /><b>IV retinoin</b> does not exist as a form of treatment for acne. Isotretinoin can have serious side effects when taken orally and these would likely be magnified if it were given intravenously.<br /><br />Finally, <b>topical retinoids</b>, while useful in treating mild-to-moderate acne, are unlikely to be sufficiently potent for this patient's severe condition. Additionally, they carry a risk of skin irritation which could exacerbate any existing inflammation and potentially contribute further to scarring.<br />",

        "body": "Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is now the most common cause of liver disease in the developed world. It is largely caused by obesity and describes a spectrum of disease ranging from:<br /><ul><li>steatosis - fat in the liver</li><li>steatohepatitis - fat with inflammation, non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH), see below</li><li>progressive disease may cause fibrosis and liver cirrhosis</li></ul><br />NAFLD is thought to represent the hepatic manifestation of the metabolic syndrome and hence <span class=\"concept\" data-cid=\"721\">insulin resistance</span> is thought to be the key mechanism leading to steatosis.<br /><br />Non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) is a term used to describe liver changes similar to those seen in alcoholic hepatitis in the absence of a history of alcohol abuse. It is relatively common and thought to affect around 3-4% of the general population. The progression of disease in patients with NASH may be responsible for a proportion of patients previously labelled as cryptogenic cirrhosis.<br /><br />Associated factors<br /><ul><li><span class=\"concept\" data-cid=\"11101\">obesity</span></li><li><span class=\"concept\" data-cid=\"721\">type 2 diabetes mellitus</span></li><li>hyperlipidaemia</li><li>jejunoileal bypass</li><li><span class=\"concept\" data-cid=\"4462\">sudden weight loss/starvation</span></li></ul><br />Features<br /><ul><li>usually asymptomatic</li><li>hepatomegaly</li><li><span class=\"concept\" data-cid=\"3981\">ALT is typically greater than AST</span></li><li>increased echogenicity on ultrasound</li></ul><br />NICE produced guidelines on the investigation and management of NAFLD in 2016. Key points:<br /><ul><li>there is no evidence to support screening for NAFLD in adults, even in at risk groups (e.g. type 2 diabetes)</li><li>the guidelines are therefore based on the management of the <i>incidental</i> finding of NAFLD - typically asymptomatic fatty changes on liver ultrasound</li><li>in these patients, NICE recommends the use of the <span class=\"concept\" data-cid=\"8322\">enhanced liver fibrosis (ELF)</span> blood test to check for advanced fibrosis</li><li>the ELF blood test is a combination of hyaluronic acid + procollagen III + tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinase 1. An algorithm based on these values results in an ELF blood test score, similar to triple testing for Down's syndrome</li></ul><br />An excellent review by Byrne et Al<sup>1</sup> in 2018 reviewed the diagnosis and monitoring of NAFLD. It made the following suggestions if the ELF blood test was not available:<br /><ul><li>non-invasive tests may be used to assess the severity of fibrosis</li><li>these include the FIB4 score or NALFD fibrosis score</li><li>these scores may be used in combination with a FibroScan (liver stiffness measurement assessed with transient elastography)</li><li>this combination has been shown to have excellent accuracy in predicting fibrosis</li></ul><br />Patients who are likely to have advanced fibrosis should be referred to a liver specialist.
