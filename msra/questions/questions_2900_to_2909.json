            "This patient is presenting with a right-sided conductive hearing loss as she has Rinne's test showing bone conduction > air conduction in the affected ear and Weber's test that lateralises to the right (affected ear). Cholesteatoma is an example of a conductive hearing loss that is also associated with chronic, smelly ear discharge and recurrent glue ear. The vignette depicts a patient who is experiencing both recurrent ear discharge and has a history of glue ear which makes this the most likely diagnosis. Cholesteatoma occurs due to squamous epithelium forming in small pockets on the tympanic membrane which becomes cyst-like as it produces keratin and sloughs over time. There will be middle ear erosion which will create an environment for anaerobic bacterial growth to occur.<br /><br />Acoustic neuroma causes sensorineural hearing loss. It is associated with dizziness and typically causes unilateral hearing loss. Sensorineural hearing loss is seen as air conduction >bone conduction in both ears and Weber test lateralising to the unaffected ear. Over time, patients with acoustic neuroma develop neurological symptoms as the tumour grows. Neurological symptoms can be predicted by the affected cranial nerves:<br /><br />    Cranial nerve VIII: hearing loss, vertigo, tinnitus.<br />    Cranial nerve V: absent corneal reflex.<br />    Cranial nerve VII: facial palsy. <br /><br />Otitis externa is an acute infection of the outer ear associated with ear pain or itching and occasionally discharge from the affected ear. It commonly affects swimmers. It can cause a conductive hearing loss as shown above. As the patient has a chronic history, this answer is less likely. Furthermore, her lack of ear pain should lead to consideration of other diagnoses. <br /><br />Otosclerosis presents with progressive conductive hearing loss and tinnitus. It is an autosomal dominant trait so patients are typically aged 20-40 years and will have a strong family history of early-onset hearing loss. It occurs as the normal bone in the middle ear is replaced by vascular spongy bone causing conductive hearing loss as the stapes becomes adherent to the oval window. As it does not typically present with smelly ear discharge, the student should consider alternative options first. <br /><br />Tympanosclerosis is caused by the calcification of collagenous scar tissue on the inner tympanic membrane and middle ear following otitis media or trauma to the tympanic membrane. Patients may be asymptomatic or develop unilateral conductive hearing loss. There may be a chalky patch on the tympanic membrane seen on otoscopy or there may be total middle ear destruction. This is not the most likely diagnosis as the patient is complaining of chronic otorrhoea which differs from the typical presentation of tympanosclerosis.",

            "<b>Arrange referral to a respiratory specialist</b> is the correct answer. According to the 2024 joint NICE/BTS/SIGN guidelines for asthma management in adults, this patient has reached Step 5 of the treatment pathway. They are already on moderate-dose Maintenance and Reliever Therapy (MART), which is Step 3. The scenario describes a failure to achieve control despite trials of both a leukotriene receptor antagonist (LTRA) and a long-acting muscarinic antagonist (LAMA), which constitutes Step 4 of the management algorithm. The guideline is explicit that when asthma remains uncontrolled despite treatment with moderate-dose MART and sequential trials of both an LTRA and a LAMA, the next step is referral to a specialist in asthma care. This allows for a more detailed assessment, confirmation of the diagnosis, exclusion of mimics, and consideration of more advanced therapies such as high-dose inhaled corticosteroids (ICS) or biologic agents. The patient's ongoing symptoms (daily reliever use, nocturnal waking) clearly indicate that their asthma is not well-controlled, mandating escalation of care to a specialist setting as per the national evidence-based pathway.<br /><br /><b>Increase to high-dose MART</b> is an incorrect next step in primary care. While escalating the dose of ICS is a key principle of asthma management, the guidelines recommend that the initiation of high-dose ICS should be undertaken following specialist assessment. Moving to high-dose ICS significantly increases the risk of systemic side effects, and it is crucial to first confirm the diagnosis, ensure optimal adherence and inhaler technique, and consider alternative diagnoses or phenotypes of asthma that may respond better to other treatments (e.g., biologics). The referral threshold is specifically set after failure of moderate-dose MART plus add-on therapies to ensure that these complex cases receive specialist input before committing the patient to the risks of long-term high-dose steroid treatment.<br /><br /><b>Arrange fractional exhaled nitric oxide testing</b> is incorrect at this stage. Fractional exhaled nitric oxide (FeNO) testing is recommended at Step 4 of the guideline, before the trials of an LTRA or LAMA. At that point, a raised FeNO or blood eosinophil count would prompt an earlier referral to a specialist. If these markers are not raised, a trial of an LTRA and then a LAMA is recommended. Since this patient has already completed these trials, the point for this investigation has passed. The indication for referral is now based on the failure of treatment, regardless of the FeNO level. Repeating or performing this test now would not change the immediate management plan, which is to refer.<br /><br /><b>Prescribe a short course of oral corticosteroids</b> is not appropriate for this clinical scenario. Oral corticosteroids (e.g., prednisolone) are reserved for the management of acute, severe exacerbations of asthma. This patient is presenting with chronic, poorly controlled symptoms rather than a distinct and severe worsening. While their control is suboptimal, there is no indication of a medical emergency requiring rescue steroids. The goal here is to optimise their long-term maintenance therapy to prevent future exacerbations and improve day-to-day symptoms, which requires a strategic change in their regular treatment, not a short-term rescue course.<br /><br /><b>Add oral theophylline</b> is an incorrect option. Theophylline is a third- or fourth-line agent that is now rarely used in primary care due to its narrow therapeutic index, need for monitoring of plasma levels, and significant potential for drug interactions and side effects (e.g., arrhythmias, seizures). Its use is generally reserved for specialist practice in patients with difficult-to-control asthma who have failed other standard therapies. It would not be considered as the next step by a GP in this situation; referral to a specialist, who might then consider agents like theophylline, is the appropriate pathway.",

        "body": "In 2024 NICE, the British Thoracic Society and SIGN produced joint guidelines on the management of asthma following many years of conflicting guidelines. The new guidelines represent a major step change in the management of asthma is both diagnosed and treated.<br /><br />For many years patients with asthma were started on a short-acting beta-2 agonist (SABA) inhaler before 'stepping up' to a regular inhaled corticosteroid with a SABA as required. The new guidelines now advocate the use of combined inhalers (ICS + long-acting beta-2 agonist) as reliever therapy or regularly, depending on the severity of asthma. Given the prevalence of asthma, it is likely that doctors will have to deal with patients on 'conventional' asthma treatments for many years to come. The joint guidelines therefore include guidance on how to manage these patients if their current treatment is controlling their symptoms sufficiently.<br /><br /><h5 class='notes-heading'>Management of adult patients aged children aged \u2265 12 years with newly diagnosed asthma</h5><br />Step 1 <a href='https://www.nice.org.uk/guidance/ng245/chapter/Recommendations#pharmacological-management-in-people-aged-12-and-over:~:text=and%20over.-,Initial%20management%20of%20newly%20diagnosed%20asthma%20in%20people%20aged%2012%20and%20over,-1.7.1' title='NICE - 2024 Asthma: diagnosis, monitoring and chronic asthma management (BTS, NICE, SIGN)' target='_blank' class='badge rounded-pill text-bg-light deeplink'>NICE</a><ul><li>a <span class=\"concept\" data-cid=\"12286\">low-dose inhaled corticosteroid (ICS)/formoterol combination inhaler to be taken as needed for symptom relief</span><ul><li>this is termed anti-inflammatory reliever (AIR) therapy</li></ul></li><li>if the patient presents highly symptomatic (for example, regular nocturnal waking) or with a severe exacerbation:<ul><li><span class=\"concept\" data-cid=\"12295\">start treatment with low-dose MART</span> (maintenance and reliever therapy, see below)</li><li>treat the acute symptoms as appropriate (e.g. a course of oral corticosteroids may be indicated)</li></ul></li></ul><br />Step 2  <a href='https://www.nice.org.uk/guidance/ng245/chapter/Recommendations#pharmacological-management-in-people-aged-12-and-over:~:text=asthma%20management.-,Medicine%20combination%20and%20sequencing%20in%20people%20aged%2012%20and%20over,-For%20guidance%20on' title='NICE - 2024 Asthma: diagnosis, monitoring and chronic asthma management (BTS, NICE, SIGN)' target='_blank' class='badge rounded-pill text-bg-light deeplink'>NICE</a> <br /><ul><li><span class=\"concept\" data-cid=\"12287\">a low-dose MART</span><ul><li>MART describes using an inhaled corticosteroid (ICS)/formoterol combination inhaler for daily maintenance therapy and the relief of symptoms as needed, i.e. regularly and as required</li></ul></li></ul><br />Step 3<br /><ul><li>a <span class=\"concept\" data-cid=\"12288\">moderate-dose MART</span></li></ul><br />Step 4<br /><ul><li><span class=\"concept\" data-cid=\"12289\">check the fractional exhaled nitric oxide (FeNO) level if available, and the blood eosinophil count</span>  <a href='https://www.nice.org.uk/guidance/ng245/chapter/Recommendations#pharmacological-management-in-people-aged-12-and-over:~:text=Check%20the%20fractional%20exhaled%20nitric%20oxide%20(FeNO)%20level%20if%20available' title='NICE - 2024 Asthma: diagnosis, monitoring and chronic asthma management (BTS, NICE, SIGN)' target='_blank' class='badge rounded-pill text-bg-light deeplink'>NICE</a> <ul><li>if <span class=\"concept\" data-cid=\"12290\">either of these is raised, refer to a specialist in asthma care</span></li><li>if <span class=\"concept\" data-cid=\"12291\">neither FeNO nor eosinophil count is raised, consider a trial of either a leukotriene receptor antagonist (LTRA) or a long-acting muscarinic receptor antagonist (LAMA)</span> used in addition to moderate-dose MART</li><li>if control has not improved, stop the LTRA or LAMA and start a trial of the alternative medicine (LTRA or LAMA)</li></ul></li></ul><br />Step 5<br /><ul><li><span class=\"concept\" data-cid=\"12292\">refer people to a specialist in asthma care</span> when asthma is not controlled despite treatment with moderate-dose MART, and trials of an LTRA and a LAMA</li></ul><br /><div class=\"container\"><div class=\"row\"><div class=\"col-md-3\"><a href=\"https://d32xxyeh8kfs8k.cloudfront.net/images_Passmedicine/pdd602b.png\" data-fancybox=\"gallery\" data-caption=\"Algorithm showing pharmacological management of asthma in people aged 12 years and over\"><img  class=\"img-thumbnail mx-auto d-block\" style=\"max-height:150px;margin-bottom:10px;\" src=\"https://d32xxyeh8kfs8k.cloudfront.net/images_Passmedicine/pdd602.png\" alt=\"\" /></a></div></div></div><br /><h5 class='notes-heading'>Transferring people aged 12 and over from other treatment pathways</h5><br />There will be many people whose asthma was managed according to the previous guidelines that present with uncontrolled asthmatic symptoms.

This patient presents with red flag features including persistent cough, significant weight loss, and a substantial smoking history, all of which warrant investigation for possible lung cancer. A chest x-ray is readily accessible in primary care, cost-effective, and can identify suspicious lesions that require further investigation. It is important to note that approximately 10% of patients subsequently diagnosed with lung cancer have a normal initial chest x-ray, so if clinical suspicion remains high despite a normal result, further imaging with CT should be arranged. The chest x-ray serves as an appropriate screening tool that can be quickly arranged from general practice and helps determine the need for urgent referral and further investigation.<br /><br /><b>CT chest</b> is the investigation of choice for characterising suspected lung cancer and is essential for staging, but it is not the first-line investigation in primary care. In UK practice, a chest x-ray should be performed first, and if this shows suspicious features or if clinical suspicion remains high despite a normal x-ray, then CT imaging would be arranged, typically through urgent suspected cancer referral pathways. Proceeding directly to CT without initial chest x-ray assessment would not follow standard primary care protocols.<br /><br /><b>Bronchoscopy</b> is an important investigation for obtaining histological diagnosis through biopsy, sometimes with endobronchial ultrasound guidance, but it is a secondary care procedure performed after imaging has identified a suspicious lesion. It would not be arranged directly from primary care as the initial investigation. Bronchoscopy is typically organised by respiratory specialists following referral and initial imaging assessment.<br /><br /><b>PET-CT scan</b> plays a valuable role in staging non-small cell lung cancer and determining eligibility for curative treatment by identifying local and distant metastatic spread. However, it is not used as a first-line diagnostic investigation in primary care. PET-CT would only be considered after a diagnosis has been established and is used specifically for treatment planning in appropriate cases.<br /><br /><b>Sputum cytology</b> has poor sensitivity for diagnosing lung cancer and is not recommended as a first-line investigation in current UK practice.

        "title": "Chronic kidney disease: hypertension",
        "body": "The majority of patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD) will require more than two drugs to treat hypertension. ACE inhibitors are first line and are particularly helpful in proteinuric renal disease (e.g. diabetic nephropathy). As these drugs tend to reduce filtration pressure a small fall in glomerular filtration pressure (GFR) and rise in creatinine can be expected. NICE suggest that a decrease in eGFR of up to 25% or a rise in creatinine of up to 30% is acceptable, although any rise should prompt careful monitoring and exclusion of other causes (e.g. NSAIDs). A rise greater than this may indicate underlying renovascular disease. <br /><br />Furosemide is useful as a anti-hypertensive in patients with CKD, particularly when the GFR falls to below 45 ml/min*. It has the added benefit of lowering serum potassium. High doses are usually required. If the patient becomes at risk of dehydration (e.g. Gastroenteritis) then consideration should be given to temporarily stopping the drug<br /><br />*the NKF K/DOQI guidelines suggest a lower cut-off of less than 30 ml/min",

            "The correct answer is <b>Phenytoin</b>. The patient's presentation of peripheral neuropathy, lymphadenopathy, and bleeding gums suggests that he has been taking phenytoin. Phenytoin is an antiepileptic drug that can cause side effects such as peripheral neuropathy, characterized by numbness and reduced sensation in a glove-and-stocking distribution. Additionally, phenytoin can cause gingival hyperplasia, which may lead to bleeding gums.

While it has been associated with some cases of peripheral neuropathy, it is not commonly linked to lymphadenopathy or bleeding gums.<br /><br /><b>Topiramate</b> is another antiepileptic medication that can cause side effects like weight loss, cognitive impairment, and kidney stones. It is not typically associated with peripheral neuropathy, lymphadenopathy or bleeding gums.<br /><br /><b>Sodium valproate</b> is an antiepileptic drug that can cause gastrointestinal disturbances, tremor, and hair loss.
