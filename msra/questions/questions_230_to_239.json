            "The correct answer is <b>HIV</b>. In the UK, HIV is not considered a notifiable disease. This means that healthcare providers are not legally required to report diagnosed cases of this disease to the public health authorities. The main reason for this is the stigma and discrimination associated with HIV/AIDS, which could potentially discourage individuals from seeking testing and treatment if they believe their status will be reported.<br /><br /><b>Tuberculosis</b> is a notifiable disease in the UK as per the Public Health (Control of Disease) Act 1984 and Public Health (Infectious Diseases) Regulations 1988. It's a severe infectious bacterial disease that primarily affects the lungs, but it can also affect other parts of the body. Early detection and appropriate management are crucial in controlling its spread.<br /><br />Likewise, <b>Measles</b> is also a notifiable disease under UK law. Measles is highly contagious and can lead to serious complications such as pneumonia and encephalitis, making it important for public health officials to monitor outbreaks closely.<br /><br /><b>Whooping cough</b>, or pertussis, caused by the bacterium <i>Bordetella pertussis</i>, is another notifiable disease in the UK. This condition presents with severe coughing fits that can last for several weeks or even months. Early identification helps protect vulnerable populations like infants who may face more serious complications from this illness.<br /><br />Finally, <b>Meningococcal septicaemia</b>, caused by <i>Neisseria meningitidis,</i> is also on the list of notifiable diseases in the UK. Rapid diagnosis and treatment are critical due to its fast progression and high mortality rate if left untreated. Notifying cases allows for prompt public health responses including prophylactic antibiotic administration among close contacts to prevent further spread of infection.<br />",

            "The correct answer is to add sitagliptin. The NICE guidelines suggest that patients with  HbA1c > 58 mmol/mol already on two drugs should be either offered a third drug or insulin therapy should be considered. Given that she is afraid of needles, insulin therapy should be avoided if possible. Hence a third drug should be added, either an SGLT-2 inhibitor, a gliptin, or pioglitazone, given that she is already taking metformin and gliclazide (a sulfonylurea). Since she has a past medical history of recurrent urinary tract infections, SGLT-2 inhibitors should be avoided as they increase the chances of developing them. Pioglitazone is rarely prescribed, so the correct option is to add sitagliptin. <br /><br />Adding exenatide is incorrect since this drug belongs to the class of GLP-1 mimetics. This class of drugs should be added only if the patient cannot tolerate triple therapy and they have a BMI greater than 35. In this case, none of these two conditions is true, making the option incorrect. <br /><br />It is incorrect to stop all the drugs and start insulin. This patient clearly stated that she is afraid of needles, and since there are other options we should take into account the patient's preference. <br /><br />Stop gliclazide and prescribe sitagliptin is incorrect as the NICE guidelines suggest that drugs should not be stopped and substituted but added together to work synergically.  You could potentially add a gliptin but you should not stop the other drugs. <br /><br />Stop metformin and prescribe pioglitazone is incorrect as the NICE guidelines suggest that drugs should not be stopped and substituted but added together to work synergically.

            "The correct answer is spironolactone. This patient has a longstanding history of liver cirrhosis. On examination, ascites is noticed, with abdominal distention and positive shifting dullness.

            "<b>Atropine</b> is the correct immediate treatment for this patient with organophosphate poisoning. The clinical scenario presents classic features of organophosphate toxicity: excessive salivation, vomiting, diarrhoea, pinpoint pupils, bradycardia, hypotension, and muscle fasciculations. These symptoms occur due to inhibition of acetylcholinesterase, leading to accumulation of acetylcholine at muscarinic and nicotinic receptors. Atropine is a competitive antagonist at muscarinic receptors and will rapidly reverse the life-threatening muscarinic effects, particularly the bradycardia and respiratory secretions. The initial dose is typically 1-2mg IV, repeated every 5-10 minutes until signs of atropinisation (tachycardia, dry mouth, dilated pupils) are achieved. In severe cases, hundreds of milligrams may be required over 24 hours.<br /><br /><b>Activated charcoal</b> has limited utility in organophosphate poisoning. While it may be considered for oral ingestions if administered within 1 hour, this patient was exposed through dermal and inhalational routes while spraying crops. Additionally, activated charcoal would not address the immediate life-threatening cholinergic crisis that requires anticholinergic therapy with atropine.<br /><br /><b>Flumazenil</b> is a benzodiazepine antagonist used to reverse benzodiazepine overdose. It has no role in organophosphate poisoning and would not address any of the patient's symptoms. The clinical picture is not consistent with benzodiazepine toxicity, which typically presents with central nervous system depression rather than cholinergic excess.<br /><br /><b>N-acetylcysteine</b> is the antidote for paracetamol poisoning and has no role in organophosphate toxicity. It works by replenishing glutathione stores in the liver, which is not relevant to the mechanism of organophosphate poisoning. The clinical features described are not consistent with paracetamol toxicity.<br /><br /><b>Pralidoxime</b> is an oxime that can reactivate acetylcholinesterase inhibited by organophosphates, particularly at nicotinic sites. While it may be used as an adjunct therapy in organophosphate poisoning, it is not the first-line treatment. Current evidence for its efficacy is mixed, and it should only be administered after atropine has been given to control muscarinic symptoms. Pralidoxime is most effective when given early (within 24-48 hours) before 'aging' of the organophosphate-enzyme complex occurs.",

Although the stages of wound healing are broadly similar their contributions will vary according to the wound type.<br /><br />The main stages of wound healing include:<br /><br /><b>Haemostasis</b><br /><ul><li>Minutes to hours following injury</li><li>Vasospasm in adjacent vessels, platelet plug formation and generation of fibrin rich clot.</li></ul><br /><b>Inflammation</b><br /><ul><li>Typically days 1-5</li><li>Neutrophils migrate into wound (function impaired in diabetes).</li><li>Growth factors released, including basic fibroblast growth factor and vascular endothelial growth factor.</li><li>Fibroblasts replicate within the adjacent matrix and migrate into wound.</li><li>Macrophages and fibroblasts couple matrix regeneration and clot substitution.</li></ul><br /><b>Regeneration</b><br /><ul><li>Typically days 7 to 56</li><li>Platelet derived growth factor and transformation growth factors  stimulate fibroblasts and epithelial cells.</li><li>Fibroblasts produce a collagen network.</li><li>Angiogenesis occurs and wound resembles granulation tissue.</li></ul><br /><b>Remodeling</b><br /><ul><li>From 6 weeks to 1 year</li><li>Longest phase of the healing process and may last up to one year (or longer). </li><li>During this phase fibroblasts become differentiated (myofibroblasts) and these facilitate wound contraction.</li><li>Collagen fibres are remodeled.</li><li>Microvessels regress leaving a pale scar.</li></ul><br />The above description represents an idealised scenario. A number of diseases may distort this process. Neovascularisation is an important early process. Endothelial cells may proliferate in the wound bed and recanalise to form a vessel. Vascular disease, shock and sepsis can all compromise microvascular flow and impair healing. <br /><br />Conditions such as jaundice will impair fibroblast synthetic function and immunity with a detrimental effect in most parts of the healing process.<br /><br /><h5 class='notes-heading'>Problems with scars:</h5><br /><b>Hypertrophic scars</b><br />Excessive amounts of collagen within a scar.

        "body": "Parvovirus B19 is a DNA virus which causes a variety of clinical presentations. It was identified in the 1980's as the cause of erythema infectiosum<br /><br /><h5 class='notes-heading'>Erythema infectiosum (also known as fifth disease or 'slapped-cheek syndrome')</h5><br />The illness may consist of a mild feverish illness which is hardly noticeable. However, in others there is a noticeable rash which appears after a few days. The rose-red rash makes the cheeks appear bright red, hence the name 'slapped cheek syndrome'. The rash may spread to the rest of the body but unlike many other rashes, it only rarely involves the palms and soles.<br /><br />The child begins to feel better as the rash appears and the rash usually peaks after a week and then fades. The rash is unusual in that for some months afterwards, a warm bath, sunlight, heat or fever will trigger a recurrence of the bright red cheeks and the rash itself. Most children recover and need no specific treatment. <span class=\"concept\" data-cid=\"8105\">School exclusion is unnecessary as the child is not infectious once the rash emerges</span>. In adults, the virus may cause acute arthritis.<br /><br />Be aware that the virus can affect an unborn baby in the first 20 weeks of pregnancy.
