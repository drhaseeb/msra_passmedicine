            "The correct answer is <b>Acromegaly</b>. This patient's presentation is classic for acromegaly, which is typically caused by a growth hormone-secreting pituitary adenoma. The key features supporting this diagnosis include the enlargement of extremities (wedding ring and shoes no longer fitting), which reflects the characteristic soft tissue and bony overgrowth seen in acromegaly. The patient also has galactorrhoea (milky nipple discharge) and hypertension, which are common associated features. The chronic headaches are likely due to the expanding pituitary tumour. Growth hormone excess leads to these manifestations through increased production of insulin-like growth factor 1 (IGF-1), which mediates many of the clinical effects.<br /><br /><b>Phaeochromocytoma</b> is incorrect. While phaeochromocytomas can cause hypertension, they typically present with paroxysmal symptoms including episodic headaches, sweating, palpitations, and anxiety due to catecholamine excess. The characteristic enlargement of extremities and galactorrhoea seen in this patient would not be features of phaeochromocytoma.<br /><br /><b>Cushing's syndrome</b> is incorrect. Although Cushing's syndrome can cause hypertension and, if due to a pituitary ACTH-secreting tumour, might cause headaches, the clinical picture would be different. Patients with Cushing's syndrome typically present with central obesity, moon face, buffalo hump, proximal myopathy, and skin changes (thin skin, easy bruising, striae). Enlargement of hands and feet is not characteristic of Cushing's syndrome, and galactorrhoea would be unusual.<br /><br /><b>Diabetes insipidus</b> is incorrect. This condition is characterised by polyuria and polydipsia due to deficient antidiuretic hormone (ADH) action. It does not cause enlargement of extremities, galactorrhoea, or hypertension. While it can be associated with pituitary pathology, the clinical features in this case are not consistent with diabetes insipidus.<br /><br /><b>Macroprolactinoma</b> is a closer differential but still incorrect. A prolactin-secreting pituitary tumour could explain the galactorrhoea and headaches. However, the characteristic enlargement of hands and feet points more specifically to growth hormone excess rather than hyperprolactinaemia. While macroprolactinomas can cause mass effects leading to headaches, the specific pattern of acral enlargement is not a feature. It's worth noting that some growth hormone-secreting tumours can co-secrete prolactin, which might explain the galactorrhoea in this case of acromegaly.",

            "<b>Androgen insensitivity syndrome</b> (AIS) is correct in this case. This patient has presented with primary amenorrhoea as she has failed to establish menstruation by 15 years of age. The blood tests show increased testosterone and her examination shows little to no axillary or pubic hair and bilateral lower pelvic masses. These findings all point in the direction of AIS, which is an X-linked recessive condition characterised by end-organ resistance to testosterone, causing genetically male children (46XY) to have a female phenotype. The bilateral lower pelvic swellings are likely to be undescended testes and testosterone is elevated due to tissues being unresponsive to it.<br /><br /><b>Congenital adrenal hyperplasia</b> (CAH) is incorrect in this case. Although this can also cause primary amenorrhoea, this is associated with the development of male secondary sexual characteristics in females (such as deep voice and hirsutism). This is because of impaired cortisol synthesis leading to surplus progesterone which is converted to extra testosterone to reduce the levels of progesterone. Unlike AIS, the body is still responsive to testosterone, therefore, this would mean that this patient would have hirsutism and excess male-pattern hair growth, including axillary and pubic hair, which is not seen here. A diagnosis of CAH would also not explain the bilateral lower pelvic swellings, which are likely to be undescended testes.<br /><br /><b>Functional hypothalamic amenorrhoea</b> is incorrect in this case. This patient's BMI falls within the normal range of 18.5 - 24.9 kg/m\u00b2, and functional hypothalamic amenorrhoea typically occurs secondary to causes of low adipose tissue, such as anorexia or excessive exercise. As well as this, this patient's FSH and LH are within the normal ranges, indicating that there is no hypothalamic dysfunction, as these would be decreased instead. This diagnosis would also not explain the bilateral lower pelvic swellings, which are likely to be undescended testes.<br /><br /><b>Polycystic ovarian syndrome</b> (PCOS) is incorrect in this case. This typically causes secondary amenorrhoea, and patients often have a history of irregular periods, rather than not starting them at all. Patients also have features of hyperandrogenism, including excessive hair growth, including the pubic and axillary regions, which does not apply here. PCOS would not explain the bilateral lower pelvic swellings, which are likely to be undescended testes. <br /><br /><b>Turner's syndrome</b> is incorrect in this case. Although this can present with primary amenorrhoea and no evidence of starting puberty, including axillary and pubic hair, patients with Turner's syndrome have hypogonadism due to their ovaries failing to produce sex hormones including oestrogen. If this patient were to have Turner's syndrome, FSH and LH would be elevated as negative feedback controls their secretion. Patients with Turner's syndrome have little to no sex hormones including estradiol, meaning negative feedback is not exerted on FSH and LH. This diagnosis would also not explain the bilateral lower pelvic swellings, which are likely to be undescended testes.",

The Faculty of Sexual and Reproductive Healthcare (FSRH) have produced specific guidance looking at this age group - 'Contraception for Women Aged Over 40 Years' - a link is provided below.<br /><br /><h5 class='notes-heading'>Specific methods</h5><br />No method of contraception is contraindicated by age alone. All methods are UKMEC1 except for the combined oral contraceptive pill (UKMEC2 for women >= 40 years) and Depo-Provera (UKMEC2 for women > 45 years). The guidance issued by the FSRH contained a number of points which should be considered about each method:<br /><br />Combined oral contraceptive pill (COCP)<br /><ul><li>COCP use in the perimenopausal period may help to maintain bone mineral density</li><li>COCP use may help reduce menopausal symptoms</li><li>a pill containing < 30 \u00b5g ethinylestradiol may be more suitable for women > 40 years</li></ul><br />Depo-Provera<br /><ul><li>women should be advised there may be a delay in the return of fertility of up to 1 year for women > 40 years</li><li>use is associated with a small loss in bone mineral density which is usually recovered after discontinuation</li></ul><br /><h5 class='notes-heading'>Stopping contraception</h5><br />The FSRH have produced a useful table detailing how the different methods may be stopped. Please follow the link for the full table.<br /><br /><div class=\"table-responsive\"><table class = \"tlarge table table-striped table-bordered\"  data-role=\"table\" id=\"tableid1\" ><thead><tr><th>Method</th><th>Women < 50 years</th><th>Women >= 50 years</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Non-hormonal (e.g. IUD, condoms, natural family planning)</td><td>Stop contraception after 2 years of amenorrhoea</td><td>Stop contraception after 1 year of amenorrhoea</td></tr><tr><td>COCP</td><td>Can be continued to 50 years</td><td>Switch to non-hormonal or progestogen-only method</td></tr><tr><td>Depo-Provera</td><td>Can be continued to 50 years</td><td>Switch to either a non-hormonal method and stop after 2 years of amenorrhoea OR switch to a progestogen-only method and follow advice below</td></tr><tr><td>Implant, POP, IUS</td><td>Can be continued beyond 50 years</td><td>Continue<br /><br />If amenorrhoeic check FSH and stop after 1 year if FSH >= 30u/l or stop at 55 years<br /><br />If not amenorrhoeic consider investigating abnormal bleeding pattern</td></tr></tbody></table></div><br /><h5 class='notes-heading'>Hormone Replacement Therapy and Contraception</h5><br />As we know hormone replacement therapy (HRT) cannot be relied upon for contraception so a separate method of contraception is needed.
