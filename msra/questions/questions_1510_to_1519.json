            "The correct answer is <b>Anti-Ro</b>. Primary Sjogren's syndrome is an autoimmune disorder characterised by lymphocytic infiltration of the exocrine glands, particularly the salivary and lacrimal glands, leading to symptoms such as dry mouth (xerostomia) and dry eyes (keratoconjunctivitis sicca). Anti-Ro (also known as SS-A) autoantibodies are found in approximately 60-70% of patients with primary Sjogren's syndrome, making it the most associated autoantibody for this condition.<br /><br /><b>Anti-RNP</b> autoantibodies are not typically associated with primary Sjogren's syndrome. They are more commonly seen in mixed connective tissue disease (MCTD), which presents with features of systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), systemic sclerosis, and polymyositis.<br /><br /><b>Anti-smooth muscle</b> autoantibodies are not linked to primary Sjogren's syndrome either. These antibodies are mainly associated with autoimmune hepatitis, a chronic liver disease characterised by immune-mediated hepatocyte injury.<br /><br /><b>Anti-centromere</b> autoantibodies are also not related to primary Sjogren's syndrome. They have a strong association with limited cutaneous systemic sclerosis (previously known as CREST syndrome: Calcinosis, Raynaud's phenomenon, Esophageal dysmotility, Sclerodactyly, and Telangiectasias).<br /><br />Finally, <b>Anti-Sm</b> autoantibodies are specific for systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) and are not typically found in primary Sjogren's syndrome.

            "<b>Advise rest and simple analgesia</b> is the correct answer. The clinical presentation of gradual-onset posterior heel pain, exacerbated by activity and associated with morning stiffness, is characteristic of Achilles tendinopathy. The normal calf squeeze test (Simmonds' test) makes a complete tendon rupture highly unlikely. According to UK guidelines (NICE CKS), the initial management for Achilles tendinopathy is conservative. This involves advising the patient to reduce or modify precipitating activities (relative rest) to allow the tendon to heal. Simple analgesia, such as paracetamol or a short course of a non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) like ibuprofen (if no contraindications exist), can help manage the pain and inflammation. This initial conservative approach is often sufficient to resolve symptoms. If the pain does not improve after a week or two of these measures, then referral to physiotherapy for a structured exercise programme would be the next appropriate step.<br /><br /><b>Urgent referral to orthopaedics</b> is incorrect. This management step is reserved for patients with a suspected acute Achilles tendon rupture. A rupture typically presents with a sudden 'pop' or a sensation of being kicked in the back of the leg during activity, followed by an immediate inability to weight-bear. The examination finding of a normal calf squeeze test in this scenario effectively rules out a complete rupture, making an urgent referral unnecessary. The history of a gradual onset over two weeks also points away from an acute rupture and towards a tendinopathy.<br /><br /><b>Referral for physiotherapy</b> is a key component of managing Achilles tendinopathy but is not the most appropriate <i>initial</i> step. While eccentric calf muscle strengthening exercises, guided by a physiotherapist, are the mainstay of treatment for persistent symptoms, initial management should focus on settling the acute inflammatory phase. A period of relative rest, activity modification, and simple analgesia should be trialled first. If symptoms fail to improve with these simple measures, then a referral to physiotherapy is indicated to commence a rehabilitation programme and address any underlying biomechanical issues.<br /><br /><b>Request an ultrasound scan</b> is not indicated at this stage. The diagnosis of Achilles tendinopathy is primarily a clinical one, based on the history and examination findings presented. Imaging is not required to confirm the diagnosis. An ultrasound scan is the first-line imaging modality when there is clinical suspicion of an Achilles tendon rupture (e.g., a positive calf squeeze test or a palpable gap in the tendon) or if the diagnosis is uncertain. As the clinical picture here is classic for tendinopathy, proceeding directly to imaging would be an unnecessary use of resources.<br /><br /><b>Arrange corticosteroid injection</b> is inappropriate and potentially harmful. While corticosteroid injections are used for some other tendinopathies, they are generally contraindicated for Achilles tendinopathy. Injecting corticosteroid into or around the Achilles tendon is associated with an increased risk of tendon weakening and subsequent rupture. This can lead to significant long-term morbidity. Therefore, this option represents a management error and should be avoided.",

            "The correct answer is the <b>13C-urea breath test</b>, which is the recommended first-line non-invasive test for <i>Helicobacter pylori</i> in the test-and-treat strategy according to NICE guidelines. This test has excellent sensitivity (95%) and specificity (95-100%). The patient ingests 13C-labelled urea, which is metabolised by <i>H. pylori</i> urease if present, producing labelled CO2 that can be detected in exhaled breath. The test is particularly suitable in this case as the patient is presenting with uncomplicated dyspepsia without alarm symptoms, making non-invasive testing appropriate.<br /><br /><b>Gastric biopsy</b> is an invasive procedure requiring endoscopy, which is not indicated as a first-line investigation in uncomplicated dyspepsia without alarm symptoms in a young patient. While it provides excellent diagnostic accuracy and allows histological examination, it carries unnecessary risks and costs in this clinical scenario.<br /><br />The <b>CLO test (rapid urease test)</b> also requires endoscopic biopsy and is therefore not appropriate as a first-line test in this case. While it provides rapid results and is useful when endoscopy is being performed for other reasons, it is too invasive for the test-and-treat strategy in primary care.<br /><br /><b>Stool culture</b> is not a recommended method for diagnosing <i>H. pylori</i> infection. While stool antigen testing is an acceptable alternative to urea breath testing, culture of <i>H. pylori</i> from stool is not routinely performed and has poor sensitivity.<br /><br />The <b>hydrogen breath test</b> is not used for detecting <i>H. pylori</i> infection. This test is instead used to diagnose small intestinal bacterial overgrowth or carbohydrate malabsorption conditions such as lactose intolerance. It measures hydrogen produced by bacterial fermentation of carbohydrates rather than the urease activity of <i>H. pylori</i>.",

It is not an absolute contraindication, but a discussion should be had as to whether medical or surgical management may be more appropriate. It is important the miscarriage is managed promptly and that antibiotics are given to prevent sepsis and/or haemorrhage.<br /><br /><b>High BMI</b> is incorrect. This is not a contraindication to expectant management.<br /><br /><b>Moderate bleeding</b> is incorrect. This is not a contraindication to expectant management. NICE guidelines state that if the woman is at increased risk of haemorrhage (for example, she is in the late first trimester) or she is at increased risk from the effects of haemorrhage (for example, if she has coagulopathies or is unable to have a blood transfusion), then other management options should be discussed. However, bleeding is a normal part of miscarriage.<br /><br /><b>Second miscarriage</b> is incorrect. This is not a contraindication to expectant management. However, if it was a third consecutive miscarriage it would be considered recurrent and management options, including surgical, should be discussed if they wish to analyse the products of conception e.g. for karyotyping. <br /><br /><b>Twin pregnancy</b> is incorrect.

        "question": "A 34-year-old overweight woman presents to the emergency department feeling feverish with vaginal bleeding and some foul-smelling discharge. A pregnancy test is positive and her vital signs are stable. She needs pads but only changes these every few hours. When asked, she discloses this is her second miscarriage and that an ultrasound last week showed a twin intrauterine pregnancy. Her last menstrual period was 7 weeks ago. After discussing options with you she explains she wants to miscarry at home without medical or surgical intervention.<br /><br />What part of her history might make this unsuitable?",
        "correct_answer": "1",
        "question_notes": "<b>Foul-smelling discharge</b> is correct. This suggests there may be an infection present, which can be a contraindication to expectant management. It is not an absolute contraindication, but a discussion should be had as to whether medical or surgical management may be more appropriate. It is important the miscarriage is managed promptly and that antibiotics are given to prevent sepsis and/or haemorrhage.<br /><br /><b>High BMI</b> is incorrect. This is not a contraindication to expectant management.<br /><br /><b>Moderate bleeding</b> is incorrect. This is not a contraindication to expectant management. NICE guidelines state that if the woman is at increased risk of haemorrhage (for example, she is in the late first trimester) or she is at increased risk from the effects of haemorrhage (for example, if she has coagulopathies or is unable to have a blood transfusion), then other management options should be discussed. However, bleeding is a normal part of miscarriage.<br /><br /><b>Second miscarriage</b> is incorrect. This is not a contraindication to expectant management. However, if it was a third consecutive miscarriage it would be considered recurrent and management options, including surgical, should be discussed if they wish to analyse the products of conception e.g. for karyotyping. <br /><br /><b>Twin pregnancy</b> is incorrect. This is not a contraindication to expectant management unless the pregnancy is more advanced and the woman is thought to be at increased risk of haemorrhage.",

An echocardiogram is the most useful investigation for screening these complications as it provides direct visualisation of the coronary arteries and can detect aneurysms or dilatations.
