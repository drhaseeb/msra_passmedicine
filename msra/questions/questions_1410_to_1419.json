        "body": "Sepsis is defined as life-threatening organ dysfunction caused by a dysregulated host response to an infection. Sepsis is increasingly recognised as an important cause of mortality in the UK and there has been increasing efforts recently to improve the care of patients who present with sepsis. <br /><br />How sepsis is classified has changed in recent years - the Surviving Sepsis Guidelines were updated in 2017. <br /><br />The new guidelines recognise the following terms:<br /><ul><li><b>sepsis</b>: life-threatening organ dysfunction caused by a dysregulated host response to infection</li><li><b>septic shock</b>: a more severe form sepsis, technically defined as <i>'in which circulatory, cellular, and metabolic abnormalities are associated with a greater risk of mortality than with sepsis alone'</i>*</li></ul><br />The old category of severe sepsis is no longer used.<br /><br />The term 'systemic inflammatory response syndrome (SIRS)' has also fallen out of favour. Adult patients outside of ICU with suspected infection are identified as being at heightened risk of mortality if they have quickSOFA (qSOFA) score meeting  >= 2 of the following criteria: respiratory rate of 22/min or greater, altered mentation, or systolic blood pressure of 100mmHg or less <br /><br /><div class='alert alert-warning'><b>qSOFA score</b><br />Respiratory rate > 22/min<br />Altered mentation<br />Systolic blood pressure < 100 mm Hg<br /></div><br /><br />Within an ICU setting a full SOFA** score is often used. Details can be found at the bottom of the notes.<br /><br /><h5 class='notes-heading'>Management</h5><br />NICE released its own guidelines in 2016. These focussed on the risk stratification and management of patients with suspected.<br /><br />For risk stratification NICE recommend using the following criteria:<br /><br /><div class=\"table-responsive\"><table class = \"tlarge table table-striped table-bordered\"  data-role=\"table\" id=\"tableid1\" ><thead><tr><th>Red flag criteria</th><th>Amber flag criteria</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td><ul><li>Responds only to voice or pain/ unresponsive</li><li>Acute confusional state</li><li>Systolic B.P <= 90 mmHg (or drop >40 from normal)</li><li>Heart rate > 130 per minute</li><li>Respiratory rate >= 25 per minute</li><li>Needs oxygen to keep SpO2 >=92%</li><li>Non-blanching rash, mottled/ ashen/ cyanotic</li><li>Not passed urine in last 18 h/ UO < 0.5 ml/kg/hr</li><li>Lactate >=2 mmol/l</li><li>Recent chemotherapy</td><td></li><li>Relatives concerned about mental status</li><li>Acute deterioration in functional ability</li><li>Immunosuppressed</li><li>Trauma/ surgery/ procedure in last 6 weeks</li><li>Respiratory rate 21-24</li><li>Systolic B.P 91-100 mmHg</li><li>Heart rate 91-130 OR new dysrhythmia</li><li>Not passed urine in last 12-18 hours</li><li>Temperature < 36\u00baC</li><li>Clinical signs of wound, device or skin infection</td></tr></tbody></table></div></li></ul><br />Clearly, the underlying cause of the patient's sepsis needs to be identified and treated and the patient supported regardless of the cause or severity. If however any of the red flags are present the 'sepsis six' should be started straight away:<br /><ul><li>1. Administer oxygen:  Aim to keep saturations > 94% (88-92% if at risk of CO2 retention e.g. COPD)</li><li>2. Take blood cultures</li><li>3. Give broad-spectrum antibiotics</li><li>4. Give intravenous fluid challenges<ul><li>NICE recommend a <span class=\"concept\" data-cid=\"11922\">bolus of 500ml crystalloid over less than 15 minutes</span></li></ul></li><li>5. Measure serum lactate </li><li>6. Measure accurate hourly urine output</li></ul><br />*these patients can be clinically identified by a vasopressor requirement to maintain a MAP \u2265 65mmHg  and serum lactate >2mmol/L in the absence of hypovolemia<br /><br />**To help identify and categorise patients the Sequential (Sepsis-Related) Organ Failure Assessment Score (SOFA) is increasingly used. The score grades abnormality by organ system and accounts for clinical interventions. However, laboratory variables, namely, PaO<sub>2</sub>, platelet count, creatinine level, and bilirubin level, are needed for full computation.<br /><br /><b>SOFA Score</b><br /><div class=\"table-responsive\"><table class = \"tlarge table table-striped table-bordered\"  data-role=\"table\" id=\"tableid2\" ><thead><tr><th><b>System</b></th><th><b>Score 0</b></th><th><b>Score 1</b></th><th><b>Score 2</b></th><th><b>Score 3</b></th><th><b>Score 4</b></th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>PaO<sub>2</sub> /FI O<sub>2</sub></td><td>>400</td><td><400</td><td><300</td><td><200</td><td><100</td></tr><tr><td>Platelets x10<sup>3</sup> microlitres</td><td>>150</td><td><150</td><td><100</td><td><50</td><td><20</td></tr><tr><td>Bilirubin \u00b5mol/L</td><td>20</td><td>20-32</td><td>33-101</td><td>102-204</td><td>>204</td></tr><tr><td>Cardiovascular</td><td>MAP >70mmHg</td><td>MAP 70mmHg</td><td>Dopamine <5 or dobutamine (any dose)</td><td>Dopamine 5.1-15<br />or epinephrine 0.1<br />or norepinephrine 0.1</td><td>Dopamine >15 or<br />epinephrine >0.1<br />or norepinephrine >0.1</td></tr><tr><td>GCS</td><td>15</td><td>13-14</td><td>10-12</td><td>6-9</td><td><6</td></tr><tr><td>Creatinine \u00b5mol/L</td><td><110</td><td>110-170</td><td>171-299</td><td>300-440</td><td>>440</td></tr><tr><td>Urine output ml/day</td><td>>500</td><td>>500</td><td>>500</td><td><500</td><td><200</td></tr></tbody></table></div><br />A SOFA score of 2 or more reflects an overall mortality risk of approximately 10% in a general hospital population with suspected infection.

            "<b>Anti-mitochondrial antibodies</b> are the correct answer. This patient presents with a cholestatic picture (predominantly raised ALP with elevated GGT) in the context of fatigue and dry eyes, suggestive of Sj\u00f6gren's syndrome. The normal ultrasound has already excluded extrahepatic biliary obstruction, which is a prerequisite before diagnosing primary biliary cholangitis (PBC). Anti-mitochondrial antibodies (AMA), specifically the M2 subtype, are present in 98% of PBC cases and are highly specific for this condition. The combination of middle-aged female, autoimmune associations (hypothyroidism, likely Sj\u00f6gren's), cholestatic liver biochemistry, and normal biliary imaging makes PBC the leading diagnosis. AMA testing is the definitive diagnostic investigation at this stage, as it directly confirms the diagnosis when positive in the appropriate clinical context.<br /><br /><b>Anti-smooth muscle antibodies</b> are found in approximately 30% of PBC patients but are more characteristic of autoimmune hepatitis (AIH). AIH typically presents with a hepatitic rather than cholestatic pattern (predominantly raised transaminases rather than ALP). While this patient has mildly elevated ALT, the dominant cholestatic picture with ALP over four times the upper limit of normal makes PBC more likely than AIH. Anti-smooth muscle antibodies lack the specificity and sensitivity of AMA for diagnosing PBC.<br /><br /><b>Anti-nuclear antibodies</b> can be positive in various autoimmune liver diseases including both PBC and AIH. However, they are non-specific and found in many autoimmune conditions. While ANAs may be present in PBC, they do not establish the diagnosis. The clinical picture here requires a specific test for PBC given the cholestatic pattern and normal biliary imaging. ANA testing would not be the most discriminatory investigation in this scenario.<br /><br /><b>Serum immunoglobulins</b> would show raised IgM in PBC, which is part of the 'M rule' for this condition. However, elevated IgM is supportive rather than diagnostic of PBC. It lacks the specificity of AMA and can be raised in other conditions. While immunoglobulins may be requested as part of a liver screen, they would not be the single most useful test to establish the diagnosis when AMA is available and has much higher diagnostic accuracy.<br /><br /><b>MRCP</b> is not indicated here as the ultrasound has already demonstrated a normal biliary tree, effectively excluding extrahepatic obstruction and structural abnormalities such as choledocholithiasis or strictures. MRCP would be considered if ultrasound suggested bile duct abnormalities or if primary sclerosing cholangitis (PSC) were suspected. PSC typically affects younger males with inflammatory bowel disease and shows bile duct stricturing on imaging.
