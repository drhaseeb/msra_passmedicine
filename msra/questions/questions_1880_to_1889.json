            "The correct answer is <b>Pelvic floor muscle training</b>. This patient's history is classical for stress urinary incontinence (SUI), which is the involuntary leakage of urine on effort or exertion, or on sneezing or coughing. The history lacks features of urge incontinence, such as a sudden compelling desire to void or nocturia. According to NICE guidelines (NG123), the first-line management for SUI is a trial of supervised pelvic floor muscle training (PFMT) for at least three months. The purpose of the initial vaginal examination is to assess for pelvic organ prolapse and to confirm that the patient can correctly initiate a voluntary contraction of the pelvic floor muscles. This finding does not indicate adequate muscle strength, but rather confirms her ability to engage the correct muscles, making her a suitable candidate for a structured training programme. The recommended regimen is at least eight contractions performed three times per day.<br /><br /><b>Bladder retraining</b> is the first-line treatment for urge incontinence, also known as overactive bladder syndrome. This involves patient education and a scheduled voiding programme with gradually increasing intervals between voids. The aim is to correct the habit of frequent voiding and suppress the sensation of urgency. As this patient's symptoms are exclusively related to physical stress and she denies urgency, bladder retraining is not the most appropriate initial management.<br /><br /><b>Prescribe oxybutynin</b> is incorrect. Oxybutynin is an antimuscarinic medication used to treat urge incontinence by reducing detrusor muscle overactivity. It is typically offered as a second-line treatment if bladder retraining is unsuccessful. It has no licensed indication or therapeutic role in the management of pure stress incontinence and would not be an appropriate choice for this patient.<br /><br /><b>Prescribe duloxetine</b> is also incorrect as a first-line option. Duloxetine, a serotonin-norepinephrine reuptake inhibitor (SNRI), is considered a second-line pharmacological option for women with predominant stress incontinence. NICE suggests it can be offered to women who prefer pharmacological treatment to surgery or are not suitable for surgical procedures. It should not be offered as a first-line treatment before a trial of conservative measures like pelvic floor muscle training.<br /><br /><b>Refer for urodynamic studies</b> is not the most appropriate next step. Urodynamic studies are specialised investigations used to assess bladder and urethral function. They are not recommended before starting conservative management for an uncomplicated case of stress incontinence. They are typically reserved for situations where the diagnosis is uncertain, in cases of mixed incontinence, or as part of the work-up prior to considering surgical intervention.",
