            "This patient has suspected coeliac disease. He has typical symptoms (which are not always present in adults) and has, importantly, returned positive anti-TTG antibodies which have high specificity and sensitivity. Endoscopic intestinal biopsy, however, is the gold standard for the diagnosis of coeliac disease and should be offered to all adult patients if the diagnosis is suspected following serology. Jejunal biopsy is correct, as the duodenum and jejunum are the most affected portions of bowel in coeliac disease, while the ileum is not as affected (unlike in Crohn's disease), and would not be an appropriate place for a biopsy sample from a professional.<br /><br />Biopsies are taken from the jejunum via a Crosby capsule (which captures 4 samples of the jejunum), or from the duodenum via endoscopic biopsy, to look for the classic features of villous atrophy. Jejunal biopsies are agreed to be better quality, however gastroenterologists may choose to take a duodenal biopsy. Patients must have been consuming gluten for at least 6 weeks prior to the biopsy to avoid a false negative result. <br /><br />Capsule endoscopy is used to identify a focus of bleeding in the gastrointestinal tract but is not used for the diagnosis of coeliac disease. It cannot take biopsies, and therefore would not be useful in the diagnosis of coeliac disease.<br /><br />IgA anti-endomysial antibodies are positive in 90% of coeliac patients. However, IgA tissue transglutaminase (TTG) antibodies have largely superseded endomysial antibodies in the diagnosis of coeliac disease, as TTG antibodies are more sensitive and specific. Identifying anti-endomysial antibodies would not be of any additional diagnostic value in this patient.<br /><br />An ileal biopsy would be used for the diagnosis of Crohn's disease, as the terminal ileum is the commonest site of pathology. In a patient positive for coeliac disease, the duodenum and jejunum would reveal villous atrophy and crypt hypertrophy, however their ileum may very well appear completely normal, giving a false negative result, delaying treatment, and potentially harming the patient. Therefore this is the incorrect answer.<br /><br />An abdominal ultrasound will not pick up the microscopic pathological changes of coeliac disease and therefore cannot confirm a diagnosis.

        "title": "Menopause: management",
        "body": "Menopause is defined as the permanent cessation of menstruation. It is caused by the loss of follicular activity. Menopause is a clinical diagnosis usually made in primary care when a woman has not had a period for 12 months. <br /><br />Menopausal symptoms are very common and affect roughly 75% of postmenopausal women. Symptoms typically last for 7 years but may resolve quicker and in some cases take much longer. The duration and severity are also variable and may develop before the start of the menopause and in some cases may start years after the onset of menopause.  <br /><br />The CKS has very thorough and clear guidance on the management of menopause and is summarised below. <br /><br />The management of menopause can be split into three categories:<br /><ul><li>Lifestyle modifications</li><li>Hormone replacement therapy (HRT)</li><li>Non-hormone replacement therapy </li></ul><br /><br /><h5 class='notes-heading'>Management with lifestyle modifications</h5><br />Hot flushes<br /><ul><li>regular exercise, weight loss and reduce stress</li></ul><br />Sleep disturbance<br /><ul><li>avoiding late evening exercise and maintaining good sleep hygiene </li></ul><br />Mood<br /><ul><li>sleep, regular exercise and relaxation</li></ul><br />Cognitive symptoms<br /><ul><li>regular exercise and good sleep hygiene </li></ul><br /><br /><h5 class='notes-heading'>Management with HRT</h5><br />Contraindications: <br /><ul><li>Current or past breast cancer</li><li>Any oestrogen-sensitive cancer </li><li>Undiagnosed vaginal bleeding</li><li>Untreated endometrial hyperplasia </li></ul><br />Roughly 10% of women will have some form of HRT to treat their menopausal symptoms. There is a current drive by NICE to increase this number as they have found that women were previously being undertreated due to worries about increased cancer risk. If the woman has a uterus then it is important not to give unopposed oestrogens as this will increase her risk of endometrial cancer. Therefore oral or transdermal combined HRT is given.<br /><br />If the woman does not have a uterus then oestrogen alone can be given either orally or in a transdermal patch.<br /> <br />Women should be advised that the symptoms of menopause typically last for 2-5 years and that treatment with HRT brings certain risks:<br /><ul><li>Venous thromboembolism: a slight increase in risk with all forms of oral HRT. No increased risk with transdermal HRT. </li><li>Stroke: slightly increased risk with oral oestrogen HRT.</li><li>Coronary heart disease: combined HRT may be associated with a slight increase in risk.</li><li>Breast cancer: there is an increased risk with all combined HRT although the risk of dying from breast cancer is not raised. </li><li>Ovarian cancer: increased risk with all HRT.</li></ul><br /><h5 class='notes-heading'>Management with non-HRT</h5><br />Vasomotor symptoms<br /><ul><li><span class=\"concept\" data-cid=\"3065\">fluoxetine, citalopram or venlafaxine</span> </li></ul><br />Vaginal dryness<br /><ul><li>vaginal lubricant or moisturiser </li></ul><br />Psychological symptoms<br /><ul><li>self-help groups, cognitive behaviour therapy or antidepressants</li></ul><br />Urogenital symptoms<br /><ul><li>if suffering from urogenital atrophy vaginal oestrogen can be prescribed. This is appropriate if they are taking HRT or not</li><li>vaginal dryness can be treated with moisturisers and lubricants. These can be offered alongside vaginal oestrogens if required. </li></ul><br /><br /><h5 class='notes-heading'>Stopping treatment</h5><br />For vasomotor symptoms, 2-5 years of HRT may be required with regular attempts made to discontinue treatment. Vaginal oestrogen may be required long term. When stopping HRT it is important to tell women that gradually reducing HRT is effective at limiting recurrence only in the short term. In the long term, there is no difference in symptom control. <br /><br />Although menopausal symptoms can be managed mainly in primary care, there are some instances when a woman should be referred to secondary care. She should be referred to secondary care if treatment has been ineffective, if there are ongoing side effects or if there is unexplained bleeding.",

She is found to have anti-acetylcholine receptor antibodies in her blood. <br /><br />As part of her workup, a CT chest is performed which reveals an anterior mediastinal mass. <br /><br />What is this anterior mediastinal mass most likely to be?",

        "question_notes": "The woman's most likely diagnosis is myasthenia gravis, given her symptoms and positive anti-AChR. <br /><br />In cases of myasthenia gravis, it is important to perform a CT chest in order to look for a thymoma. Removal of a thymoma may improve the condition in certain patients and prevents malignant transformation. <br /><br />Benign lung nodules, lung tumours, sarcoidosis and tuberculosis are all conditions that will show up on a CT chest, however given this woman's presentation of myasthenia gravis, it is unlikely that she has these concomitant conditions in light of thymoma being an answer option. <br /><br />Note that the mediastinum is the region between the pulmonary cavities and does not contain the lungs (see notes below).

            "<b>Increase dietary fibre and fluid intake</b> is the most appropriate initial management for this patient with grade II internal haemorrhoids. First-line therapy for haemorrhoids focuses on lifestyle modifications to soften stools and reduce straining during defecation. Increasing dietary fibre (through foods or supplements like psyllium husk) and fluid intake helps to soften stool consistency, making defecation easier and reducing pressure on the haemorrhoidal vessels. This conservative approach is particularly appropriate for this patient who has grade II haemorrhoids (which prolapse on defecation but reduce spontaneously) and is slightly overweight. These measures often provide sufficient symptom relief and can prevent progression of haemorrhoidal disease. The patient should also be advised to avoid prolonged sitting on the toilet and straining during defecation.<br /><br /><b>Rubber band ligation</b> is an outpatient procedure where a small rubber band is placed at the base of the haemorrhoid, cutting off its blood supply and causing it to shrink. While this is an effective treatment for symptomatic grade II-III haemorrhoids, it is not the first-line approach. Rubber band ligation would be considered if conservative measures fail to control symptoms after an adequate trial period (usually several weeks). It is more invasive than dietary modifications and carries small risks of pain, bleeding, and rarely, infection.<br /><br /><b>Topical steroid cream</b> may help reduce inflammation and itching associated with haemorrhoids, but it does not address the underlying cause. These preparations, often combined with local anaesthetics, are adjunctive treatments that can provide symptomatic relief but should not be used as the primary management strategy. They are more appropriate for short-term symptom control alongside conservative measures. Prolonged use of topical steroids can cause skin thinning and other local side effects.<br /><br /><b>Haemorrhoidectomy</b> is a surgical procedure to remove haemorrhoids and is reserved for severe cases (typically grade III-IV) that have not responded to conservative and outpatient treatments. It would be excessive for this patient with grade II haemorrhoids who has not yet tried first-line management. Surgery carries risks of pain, bleeding, infection, and rarely, faecal incontinence, and should only be considered after failure of less invasive approaches.<br /><br /><b>Injection sclerotherapy</b> involves injecting a sclerosing agent into the haemorrhoidal tissue to reduce blood flow and shrink the haemorrhoids.

It is an attractive technique as it provides a wide field of blockade but does not require the placement of any indwelling devices. There is no post-operative motor impairment. For this reason, it is the preferred technique when extensive laparoscopic abdominal procedures are performed. They will then provide analgesia immediately following surgery but as they do not confine the patient to bed, the focus on enhanced recovery can begin sooner. <br /><br />The main disadvantage is that their duration of action is limited to the half-life of the local anaesthetic agent chosen. In addition, some anaesthetists do not have the USS skills required to site the injections.<br /><br /><h5 class='notes-heading'>Patient Controlled Analgesia (PCA)</h5> <br />Patients administer their own intravenous analgesia and titrate the dose to their own end-point of pain relief using a small microprocessor - controlled pump.

Has 10% potency of morphine.</li><li>Short half life and similar bioavailability and clearance to morphine. </li><li>Short duration of action and may need to be given hourly. </li><li>Pethidine has a toxic metabolite (norpethidine) which is cleared by the kidney, but which accumulates in renal failure or following frequent and prolonged doses and may lead to muscle twitching and convulsions. Extreme caution is advised if pethidine is used over a prolonged period or in patients with renal failure. </li></ul><br />Codeine<br /><ul><li>markedly less active than morphine, has predictable effects when given orally and is effective against mild to moderate pain. </li></ul><br /><h5 class='notes-heading'>Non opioid analgesics</h5><br />Paracetamol<br /><ul><li>Inhibits prostaglandin synthesis.  </li><li>Analgesic and antipyretic properties but has little anti-inflammatory effect</li><li>It is well absorbed orally and is metabolised almost entirely in the liver</li><li>Side effects in normal dosage and is widely used for the treatment of minor pain. It causes hepatotoxicity in overdosage by overloading the normal metabolic pathways with the formation of a toxic metabolite. </li></ul><br />NSAIDs<br /><ul><li>Analgesic and anti-inflammatory actions</li><li>Inhibition of prostaglandin synthesis by the enzyme cyclooxygenase which catalyses the conversion of arachidonic acid to the various prostaglandins that are the chief mediators of inflammation. All NSAIDs work in the same way and thus there is no point in giving more than one at a time</li><li>NSAIDs are, in general, more useful for superficial pain arising from the skin, buccal mucosa, joint surfaces and bone. </li><li>Relative contraindications: history of peptic ulceration, gastrointestinal bleeding or bleeding diathesis; operations associated with high blood loss, asthma, moderate to severe renal impairment, dehydration and any history of hypersensitivity to NSAIDs or aspirin.</li></ul>",

            "<b>Urgent referral to community mental health team</b> is the correct answer. This patient presents with clear features of mania: severely reduced sleep need (2 hours per night), grandiose delusions (believing she has special powers to communicate with animals), increased goal-directed activity (starting multiple business ventures), and pressured speech. The presence of psychotic symptoms (delusions of special powers) distinguishes this as mania rather than hypomania. According to NICE guidelines, features of mania in primary care warrant urgent referral to the CMHT. The patient requires specialist psychiatric assessment and will likely need antipsychotic medication, but this should be initiated by specialist services given the severity and complexity of presentation. The GP's role is to recognise the urgency and ensure rapid access to appropriate care.<br /><br /><b>Start fluoxetine and review in 2 weeks</b> is inappropriate and potentially harmful. This patient has mania, not depression. Antidepressants can precipitate or worsen manic episodes in patients with bipolar disorder. If a patient with bipolar disorder is already taking an antidepressant when they develop mania, NICE recommends considering stopping it. Starting an antidepressant in this context would be contraindicated and could exacerbate her symptoms significantly.<br /><br /><b>Routine referral to community mental health team</b> would be insufficient given the severity of presentation. NICE guidelines specify that routine referral is appropriate for suspected hypomania, where there is decreased or increased function for 4 days or more without psychotic features. This patient has clear psychotic symptoms (grandiose delusions) and severe functional impairment, indicating mania rather than hypomania, which requires urgent rather than routine referral.<br /><br /><b>Start olanzapine and arrange follow-up</b> is not appropriate management in primary care. While antipsychotics such as olanzapine are indeed first-line treatment for acute mania, initiating such treatment should be done by specialist mental health services, particularly in a patient with no previous psychiatric history or diagnosis. The GP should facilitate urgent specialist assessment rather than starting antipsychotic medication independently. Additionally, baseline investigations and monitoring would be required.<br /><br /><b>Refer to liaison psychiatry for assessment within 48 hours</b> is not the most appropriate pathway. Liaison psychiatry services typically operate within acute hospital settings to assess patients who present to emergency departments or are admitted to medical wards. This patient is presenting in primary care and does not require hospital admission at this stage. The appropriate pathway is urgent referral to the CMHT, who can assess and manage her in the community setting, escalating to crisis team or admission if needed.",

If a patient with bipolar disorder is already taking an antidepressant when they develop mania, NICE recommends considering stopping it. Starting an antidepressant in this context would be contraindicated and could exacerbate her symptoms significantly.<br /><br /><b>Routine referral to community mental health team</b> would be insufficient given the severity of presentation. NICE guidelines specify that routine referral is appropriate for suspected hypomania, where there is decreased or increased function for 4 days or more without psychotic features. This patient has clear psychotic symptoms (grandiose delusions) and severe functional impairment, indicating mania rather than hypomania, which requires urgent rather than routine referral.<br /><br /><b>Start olanzapine and arrange follow-up</b> is not appropriate management in primary care. While antipsychotics such as olanzapine are indeed first-line treatment for acute mania, initiating such treatment should be done by specialist mental health services, particularly in a patient with no previous psychiatric history or diagnosis. The GP should facilitate urgent specialist assessment rather than starting antipsychotic medication independently. Additionally, baseline investigations and monitoring would be required.<br /><br /><b>Refer to liaison psychiatry for assessment within 48 hours</b> is not the most appropriate pathway. Liaison psychiatry services typically operate within acute hospital settings to assess patients who present to emergency departments or are admitted to medical wards. This patient is presenting in primary care and does not require hospital admission at this stage. The appropriate pathway is urgent referral to the CMHT, who can assess and manage her in the community setting, escalating to crisis team or admission if needed.",
