            "Aspirin is a non-reversible inhibitor of COX 1 and COX 2. It inhibits the conversion of arachidonic acid to prostaglandin, prostacyclin and thromboxane. Thromboxane A2 promotes platelet aggregation and vasoconstriction. High dose aspirin is given acutely in acute coronary syndrome to prevent enlargement of the coronary thrombus.<br /><br />Selective COX 2 inhibitors (such as celecoxib and meloxicam) act exclusively on the COX 2 pathway to prevent the production of prostaglandin and prostacyclin in order to produce anti-inflammatory and analgesic properties. As they do not act on COX 1, they are not associated with the side effects of gastrointestinal ulceration and bleeding seen in traditional non-selective NSAIDs. However, they promote platelet aggregation, and therefore a key side effect is cardiovascular events. <br /><br />Phosphodiesterase inhibitors block the action of phosphodiesterase, resulting in reduced production of intracellular cyclic AMP and cyclic GMP. There are several classes of this drug, depending on the location of action. Dipyridamole is a PDE3 inhibitor, which acts to reduce platelet aggregation. It is used in the secondary prevention of stroke and TIA.<br /><br />P2Y12-ADP receptor antagonists (such as clopidogrel and ticagrelor) act to prevent platelet activation and aggregation. They are used acutely in acute coronary syndrome (in combination with aspirin), and for the secondary prevention of acute coronary syndrome and stroke/TIA.<br /><br />GP IIb/IIIa receptor inhibitors (such as abciximab, eptifibatide, tirofiban) block the GP IIb/IIIa receptor, and therefore prevent platelets aggregating with fibrinogen. They are used in the acute management of NSTEMI and STEMI.",

        "title": "Aspirin",
        "body": "Aspirin works by blocking the action of both <span class=\"concept\" data-cid=\"8980\">cyclooxygenase-1 and 2</span>. Cyclooxygenase is responsible for prostaglandin, prostacyclin and thromboxane synthesis. The blocking of <span class=\"concept\" data-cid=\"11008\">thromboxane A2</span> formation in platelets reduces the ability of platelets to aggregate which has lead to the widespread use of low-dose aspirin in cardiovascular disease. Until recent guidelines changed all patients with established cardiovascular disease took aspirin if there was no contraindication. Following the 2010 technology appraisal of clopidogrel this is no longer the case*.<br /><br />Two recent trials (the Aspirin for Asymptomatic Atherosclerosis and the Antithrombotic Trialists Collaboration) have cast doubt on the use of aspirin in primary prevention of cardiovascular disease. Guidelines have not yet changed to reflect this. However the Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA) issued a drug safety update in January 2010 reminding prescribers that aspirin is not licensed for primary prevention.<br /><br />What do the <i>current</i> guidelines recommend?<br /><ul><li>first-line for patients with ischaemic heart disease</li></ul><br />Potentiates<br /><ul><li>oral hypoglycaemics</li><li>warfarin</li><li>steroids</li></ul><br />Aspirin should not be used in children under 16 due to the risk of <span class=\"concept\" data-cid=\"2131\">Reye's syndrome</span>. An exception is Kawasaki disease, where the benefits are thought to outweigh the risks.<br /><br /><br />*NICE now recommend clopidogrel first-line following an ischaemic stroke and for peripheral arterial disease. For TIAs the situation is more complex. Recent Royal College of Physician (RCP) guidelines support the use of clopidogrel in TIAs. However the older NICE guidelines still recommend aspirin + dipyridamole - a position the RCP state is 'illogical'",

            "The correct answer is <b>Hypokalaemic metabolic alkalosis</b>. This patient's presentation of weight gain, impotence, hypertension, purple striae, and decreased muscle strength is suggestive of Cushing's syndrome. Cushing's syndrome can be caused by an excess of cortisol production from the adrenal glands or exogenous glucocorticoid use. The excess cortisol can lead to sodium and water retention, causing hypertension and hypokalaemic metabolic alkalosis. In this case, the urea and electrolytes would most likely show low potassium levels with a concurrent metabolic alkalosis.<br /><br /><b>Hypokalaemic metabolic acidosis</b> is not the most likely finding in this scenario. While hypokalaemia might be present due to increased mineralocorticoid activity from cortisol, metabolic acidosis would not be expected in Cushing's syndrome.<br /><br /><b>Hyperkalaemic metabolic alkalosis</b> is also unlikely in this case. Hyperkalaemia is not typically associated with Cushing's syndrome as cortisol has mineralocorticoid activity that leads to increased potassium excretion and subsequent hypokalaemia. Additionally, although there may be a component of metabolic alkalosis due to the mineralocorticoid effects of cortisol, it would not coexist with hyperkalaemia.<br /><br /><b>Hypocalcaemic metabolic acidosis</b> does not fit the clinical picture presented for this patient. Hypocalcaemia may result from various causes such as chronic kidney disease or primary hypoparathyroidism; however, these conditions do not align with the symptoms described for this patient (weight gain, impotence, hypertension). Furthermore, while hypocalcaemia could potentially cause muscle weakness or tetany-like symptoms in severe cases, it would not explain the other features observed in this patient.<br /><br />Finally, <b>Hyperkalaemic metabolic acidosis</b> is also implausible given the patient's presentation. As mentioned earlier, Cushing's syndrome is more likely to cause hypokalaemia due to the mineralocorticoid effects of cortisol. Additionally, metabolic acidosis would not be expected in this case, as the excess cortisol would typically lead to a metabolic alkalosis instead.",
