            "<b>SSRI discontinuation syndrome</b> is the correct answer in this clinical scenario. This patient has abruptly stopped sertraline after 8 months of regular use, and is now presenting 5 days later with a constellation of symptoms highly characteristic of SSRI discontinuation. The key features supporting this diagnosis include the temporal relationship between stopping the medication and symptom onset (typically occurring within 2-5 days of cessation), and the specific symptom profile. The patient exhibits gastrointestinal symptoms (diarrhoea and nausea), neurological symptoms (headache and paraesthesia in the hands), and general malaise ('shaky' feeling). These symptoms align perfectly with the recognised features of SSRI discontinuation syndrome, which include mood changes, restlessness, sleep disturbance, unsteadiness, sweating, gastrointestinal disturbance, and paraesthesia. Whilst sertraline has a moderate half-life compared to other SSRIs, abrupt cessation can still precipitate discontinuation symptoms. The normal vital signs and unremarkable physical examination help exclude other acute medical conditions. Management would involve restarting the SSRI and then gradually tapering over at least 4 weeks if discontinuation is still desired. This case highlights the importance of patient education about the need to continue medications and not to stop abruptly, as well as ensuring adequate prescription supplies to prevent unintentional discontinuation.<br /><br /><b>Serotonin syndrome</b> is an incorrect answer as this condition occurs with excessive serotonergic activity, typically when SSRIs are combined with other serotonergic medications (such as MAOIs, triptans, or tramadol) or when doses are increased. The clinical features of serotonin syndrome include a triad of mental status changes (agitation, confusion), autonomic hyperactivity (hyperthermia, tachycardia, hypertension, diaphoresis), and neuromuscular abnormalities (hyperreflexia, clonus, rigidity). This patient's vital signs are normal, which argues strongly against serotonin syndrome, as autonomic instability is a hallmark of this condition. Furthermore, the patient has stopped rather than started or increased serotonergic medication, making this diagnosis implausible. The timing is also wrong - serotonin syndrome typically develops within hours of the precipitating event (drug initiation, dose increase, or drug interaction), not days after stopping a medication. The symptoms described, particularly the paraesthesia and gastrointestinal upset without autonomic features, are much more consistent with discontinuation syndrome than serotonin excess.<br /><br /><b>Anxiety disorder relapse</b> is a tempting distractor as this patient does have an underlying history of depression, and anxiety and depression commonly coexist. The 'shaky' feeling could potentially be attributed to anxiety, and patients with anxiety disorders can experience gastrointestinal symptoms. However, several features make this diagnosis less likely than SSRI discontinuation syndrome. Firstly, the acute onset of symptoms precisely 5 days after stopping medication, rather than a more gradual return of psychiatric symptoms, suggests a pharmacological rather than psychiatric aetiology. Secondly, the prominent physical symptoms, particularly the paraesthesia and diarrhoea, are not typical presenting features of anxiety relapse. Thirdly, anxiety relapse would typically occur over weeks to months after stopping an effective antidepressant, not within days. The patient was stable on sertraline for 8 months, suggesting good disease control. Whilst relapse is certainly a risk when stopping antidepressants (which is why gradual tapering and continued treatment for at least 6 months after remission is recommended), the acute timeframe and specific symptom constellation point more clearly to a discontinuation syndrome.<br /><br /><b>Irritable bowel syndrome</b> is an implausible diagnosis in this acute presentation. IBS is a chronic functional gastrointestinal disorder characterised by recurrent abdominal pain associated with altered bowel habits (diarrhoea, constipation, or both), typically developing over months to years. The diagnosis requires symptoms to be present for at least 6 months, with pain occurring at least 1 day per week in the last 3 months. This patient presents with an acute 2-day history, which is completely inconsistent with the chronic, relapsing-remitting nature of IBS. Furthermore, IBS does not explain the neurological symptoms (headache and paraesthesia) or the 'shaky' feeling. The temporal relationship with stopping sertraline is coincidental if this were IBS, which would be highly unlikely. Whilst SSRIs are sometimes used to treat IBS symptoms (particularly IBS with diarrhoea), the acute presentation following medication cessation makes this diagnosis untenable. The constellation of gastrointestinal and neurological symptoms occurring together shortly after stopping an SSRI is pathognomonic for discontinuation syndrome rather than a primary gastrointestinal disorder.<br /><br /><b>Viral labyrinthitis</b> could superficially explain some of this patient's symptoms, particularly the 'shaky' feeling, which might represent unsteadiness or vertigo, and the nausea. Viral labyrinthitis typically presents with acute onset vertigo, nausea, vomiting, and balance problems, often following an upper respiratory tract infection. The headache could also potentially fit with this diagnosis. However, several key features make this diagnosis less likely. Firstly, there is no mention of true vertigo (a sensation of the room spinning) or hearing loss, which are cardinal features of labyrinthitis. The patient describes feeling 'shaky' rather than vertiginous, which is more consistent with general malaise. Secondly, viral labyrinthitis does not explain the paraesthesia in the hands or the diarrhoea. Thirdly, and most importantly, the temporal relationship with stopping sertraline 5 days ago provides a much more compelling explanation for the symptom complex. The combination of gastrointestinal, neurological, and general symptoms occurring precisely after SSRI cessation is highly specific for discontinuation syndrome. Whilst viral labyrinthitis is more plausible than some other distractors because it could explain the dizziness and nausea, the absence of typical vestibular symptoms and the presence of features unexplained by this diagnosis (particularly paraesthesia and the medication history) make it incorrect.",

            "The correct answer is <b>Jaundice</b>. Ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome (OHSS) is a complication that can occur in women undergoing in vitro fertilisation (IVF). It results from an excessive response to taking the medicines (gonadotropins) to stimulate the development of eggs in the ovaries. However, jaundice, which is a yellowing of the skin and eyes due to raised bilirubin levels, is not typically associated with OHSS.
