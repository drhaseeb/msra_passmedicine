This typically occurs within the first 18 weeks of treatment but can occur at any time.

This precipitates damage to endothelial cells and pericytes<br /><br />Endothelial dysfunction leads to increased vascular permeability which causes the characteristic exudates seen on fundoscopy.

            "The correct answer is <b>Alpha-1 antagonist</b>. This patient's symptoms, including nocturia, hesitancy and terminal dribbling, along with a moderately enlarged prostate on examination, are suggestive of benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH). In the UK, the first-line management for BPH with bothersome lower urinary tract symptoms is an alpha-1 antagonist such as tamsulosin or alfuzosin. These drugs work by relaxing the smooth muscle in the prostate and bladder neck, thereby improving urinary flow.<br /><br /><b>5 alpha-reductase inhibitor</b> is not the first line treatment for BPH but can be considered in patients who have moderate to severe lower urinary tract symptoms and an enlarged prostate. They work by shrinking the size of the prostate over time. However, they can take up to 6 months to show effect which makes them less suitable in this case where symptomatic relief is required.<br /><br />A <b>Non-urgent referral for transurethral resection of prostate</b> might be appropriate if medical management fails or if there are complications such as recurrent urinary infections, renal impairment due to urinary retention or bladder stones. However, this invasive procedure carries risks and would not typically be a first-line option.<br /><br /><b>Empirical treatment with ciprofloxacin for 2 weeks</b> would be inappropriate unless there was evidence of infection such as fever or pyuria. In this case scenario, there is no mention of any signs suggesting infection.<br /><br />An <b>Urgent referral to urology</b> would be indicated if there were red flag symptoms suggestive of prostate cancer such as haematuria or bone pain, a significantly raised PSA level or abnormal findings on digital rectal examination (DRE) like a hard irregular prostate. In this case scenario, the patient has a normal DRE and his PSA level does not warrant an urgent referral according to UK guidelines.",
