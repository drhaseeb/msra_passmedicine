            "The correct answer is <b>Buprenorphine</b> as it is the safest opioid choice in patients with renal impairment. Buprenorphine undergoes predominantly hepatic metabolism with minimal renal excretion. It is eliminated primarily through the biliary system, with less than 30% excreted in urine. Additionally, its metabolites are not pharmacologically active, making it a particularly safe choice in chronic kidney disease (CKD).<br /><br /><b>Morphine</b> is not appropriate in severe renal impairment as both morphine and its active metabolites (particularly morphine-6-glucuronide) accumulate in renal failure. This accumulation can lead to serious adverse effects including respiratory depression and confusion. The risk is particularly high in CKD stage 4, where glomerular filtration rate is severely reduced.<br /><br /><b>Hydromorphone</b> is also problematic in renal impairment. Although it has fewer active metabolites than morphine, its primary metabolite (hydromorphone-3-glucuronide) can accumulate in renal failure and may cause neurotoxicity. Dose adjustment would be required, making it a less suitable choice.<br /><br /><b>Diamorphine</b> is metabolised to morphine in the body, and therefore presents the same risks as morphine in renal impairment. The active metabolites will accumulate, potentially leading to opioid toxicity. It should be avoided or used with extreme caution in severe renal impairment.<br /><br /><b>Tramadol</b> is contraindicated in severe renal impairment as both the parent drug and its active metabolite (O-desmethyltramadol) accumulate. This can lead to increased risk of seizures and serotonin syndrome. Additionally, tramadol's analgesic effect may be reduced in renal failure due to decreased conversion to its active metabolite.",

Please see the link for more details.<br /><br />Starting treatment<br /><ul><li>when starting treatment, offer patients with advanced and progressive disease regular oral modified-release (MR) or oral immediate-release morphine (depending on patient preference), with oral immediate-release morphine for breakthrough pain</li><li>if no comorbidities use 20-30mg of MR a day with 5mg morphine for breakthrough pain. For example, 15mg modified-release morphine tablets twice a day with 5mg of oral morphine solution as required</li><li>oral modified-release morphine should be used in preference to transdermal patches</li><li>laxatives should be prescribed for all patients initiating strong opioids</li><li>patients should be advised that nausea is often transient. If it persists then an antiemetic should be offered</li><li>drowsiness is usually transient - if it does not settle then adjustment of the dose should be considered</li></ul><br /><h5 class='notes-heading'>SIGN guidelines</h5><br />SIGN issued guidance on the control of pain in adults with cancer in 2008.

            "The correct answer is to <b>Continue allopurinol in current dose</b>. Allopurinol is a xanthine oxidase inhibitor that reduces the production of uric acid, and it is used as a long-term management strategy for gout. According to the UK guidelines, during an acute attack of gout, existing urate-lowering therapy (like allopurinol) should not be discontinued or altered in dosage. This is because changes in serum urate levels can precipitate acute attacks. Therefore, continuing allopurinol at its current dose would be the most appropriate course of action.<br /><br />The option to <b>Stop and recommence 4 weeks after acute inflammation has settled</b> is incorrect. Discontinuing allopurinol during an acute attack could potentially prolong the episode or trigger another attack due to fluctuating serum urate levels. <br /><br />Similarly, the suggestion to <b>Reduce allopurinol to 100mg od until the acute attack has settled</b> is also not advisable as this may lead to changes in serum urate levels which can exacerbate the condition.<br /><br />The proposal to <b>Stop and switch to colchicine prophylaxis</b> is inappropriate too. Colchicine acts by decreasing inflammation caused by gout but does not lower urate levels like allopurinol does. It's generally used for short-term treatment during an acute gout flare or for prophylaxis in patients who cannot tolerate urate-lowering therapies such as allopurinol.<br /><br />Lastly, choosing to <b>Stop and recommence 2 weeks after acute inflammation has settled</b> would again result in an alteration of serum urate levels which could potentially trigger another gout flare-up.<br /><br />In conclusion, maintaining a stable serum urate level with continued administration of allopurinol at its current dose is crucial in managing this patient's condition according to UK guidelines.",

            "The correct answer is <b>Yellow fever</b> vaccine, as this is a live attenuated vaccine that is contraindicated in patients on immunosuppressive therapy such as azathioprine. Azathioprine is a purine synthesis inhibitor that suppresses both cellular and humoral immune responses. Live vaccines can potentially cause infection in immunocompromised patients, as the weakened pathogen may replicate and cause disease in those with impaired immune function.

The toxins are rendered harmless (detoxified) and used as antigens in the vaccine. When the immune system encounters these non-toxic toxoids, it learns to combat the natural toxins the bacteria produce, providing immunity against the toxic effects of infections</li><li>toxoid vaccines often require booster doses to maintain immunity since, like inactivated vaccines, the immune response they induce can wane over time</li><li>examples:<ul><li><span class=\"concept\" data-cid=\"6352\">tetanus</span></li><li><span class=\"concept\" data-cid=\"6353\">diphtheria</span></li><li><span class=\"concept\" data-cid=\"6354\">pertussis</span></li></ul></li></ul><br />Subunit and conjugate vaccines are often grouped together.

The symptoms are relatively mild and short-term, and there is no history of more severe mood disturbances or chronic depression, making adjustment disorder the most likely diagnosis.<br /><br /><b>Major depressive disorder (MDD)</b> is incorrect because MDD involves more severe and persistent depressive symptoms that are not clearly tied to an external stressor. The patient\u2019s symptoms appear to be a reaction to the recent job loss, which is more characteristic of adjustment disorder.<br /><br /><b>Generalized anxiety disorder (GAD)</b> is incorrect because while the patient is stressed, his symptoms are more focused on a specific life event (job loss), and he does not report the pervasive and excessive worry about various aspects of life seen in GAD.

            "<b>Delusional disorder</b> is correct because the patient presents with a fixed, false belief (being spied on by his neighbours) that persists despite a lack of evidence. The belief is non-bizarre, meaning it could happen in reality, but there is no substantial evidence, and the patient\u2019s overall functioning is relatively intact, which is characteristic of delusional disorder.<br /><br /><b>Schizophrenia</b> is incorrect because schizophrenia typically involves additional symptoms such as hallucinations, disorganised thinking, or significant functional impairment. In contrast, the patient\u2019s delusion is isolated, and he otherwise functions well, which fits more with delusional disorder.<br /><br /><b>Obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD)</b> is incorrect because OCD is characterized by intrusive, irrational thoughts (obsessions) that the patient recognizes as unreasonable, coupled with compulsive behaviors to reduce anxiety. In this case, the patient\u2019s belief is fixed and resistant to reason, which aligns with delusional disorder rather than OCD."

        "body": "Personality disorders (PD) are a group of mental health conditions characterised by persistent patterns of thinking, feeling, and behaving that are significantly different from cultural expectations. These patterns can lead to distress or problems in personal, social, and occupational functioning. It is thought that around 1 in 20 people have a personality disorder.<br /><br />For many years patients were diagnosed with a specific 'named' personality disorder, such as narcissistic or paranoid. This approach was changed significantly with the introduction of the ICD-11 classification which marked a shift towards a more dimensional model, such as severity and specific problems. This allows for a more flexible and comprehensive understanding of personality pathology.<br /><br />The majority of patients you'll encounter with personality disorders will be 'labelled' using the previous classification system. We've therefore included details of this classification at the end of the notes.<br /><br /><h5 class='notes-heading'>ICD-11 classification of personality disorders</h5><br /><b>Key Features of Personality Disorder (ICD-11)</b><br /><ul><li>Persistent Pattern: The individual's patterns of cognition, emotional experience, behaviour, and interpersonal functioning deviate from cultural expectations. These patterns are stable over time and span across various personal and social situations.</li><li>Impairment: The deviation results in significant problems or dysfunctions in the person\u2019s life, especially in relationships, work, or social functioning.</li><li>Duration: These characteristics are stable over time, beginning in adolescence or early adulthood, and are not transient.</li><li>Distress or Dysfunction: The impairment may result in distress to the individual or others. These patterns are not explained by another mental disorder, a medical condition, or substance misuse.</li></ul><br /><b>Severity Classification in ICD-11</b><br /><br />In the ICD-11, personality disorders are classified based on the degree of severity. This provides a broader and more flexible approach:<br /><br />Mild Personality Disorder:<br /><ul><li>Some impairments in functioning, often limited to specific areas of life (e.g., intimate relationships or work).</li><li>Symptoms may be noticeable to others but do not cause pervasive distress or dysfunction.</li><li>The individual may still maintain relatively stable relationships and occupational roles.</li></ul><br />Moderate Personality Disorder:<br /><ul><li>More significant impairments in multiple areas of life (personal, social, and work).</li><li>The individual may struggle with maintaining close relationships, and there may be greater interpersonal difficulties.</li><li>More distressing symptoms are present, but the individual can manage day-to-day functioning with some effort or support.</li></ul><br />Severe Personality Disorder:<br /><ul><li>Profound impairments in all areas of life.</li><li>Individuals may experience pervasive difficulties in interpersonal relationships, self-identity, and coping mechanisms.</li><li>Significant distress, dysfunction, and reduced quality of life are common.</li><li>Individuals may require intensive and long-term therapeutic interventions.</li></ul><br /><b>Personality Disorder Trait Domains:</b><br /><br />In addition to severity, ICD-11 allows clinicians to specify trait domains that represent the predominant problematic areas in the individual's personality. These are:<br /><ul><li>Negative Affectivity:<ul><li>Tendency to experience a wide range of negative emotions such as anxiety, depression, guilt, and anger.</li><li>Individuals may be prone to mood swings, insecurity, and emotional lability.</li></ul></li><li>Detachment:<ul><li>Avoidance of social interactions, emotional withdrawal, and limited pleasure from relationships.</li><li>Individuals may appear cold, aloof, and isolated.</li></ul></li><li>Dissociality:<ul><li>Disregard for the rights and feelings of others, lack of empathy, and difficulty forming prosocial relationships.</li><li>mpulsivity and manipulative behaviours are common traits.</li></ul></li><li>Disinhibition:<ul><li>Impulsiveness, risk-taking, and difficulty controlling behaviours.</li><li>Individuals may struggle with planning and foresight, leading to reckless or irresponsible actions.</li></ul></li><li>Anankastia:<ul><li>Preoccupation with orderliness, control, and perfectionism.</li><li>Individuals may be rigid, stubborn, and excessively focused on rules and details.</li></ul></li><li>Borderline Pattern (also recognised in ICD-11):<ul><li>An additional qualifier for those showing emotional instability, intense and unstable interpersonal relationships, a fluctuating sense of identity, and impulsivity. </li><li>This pattern is akin to borderline personality disorder as recognised in ICD-10 and DSM-5.</li></ul></li></ul><br /><br /><h5 class='notes-heading'>Previous classification of personality disorders</h5><br />They are typically categorised as belonging to one of three clusters:<br /><br /><div class=\"table-responsive\"><table class = \"tlarge table table-striped table-bordered\"  data-role=\"table\" id=\"tableid1\" ><thead><tr><th>Cluster A: 'Odd or Eccentric'</th><th>Cluster B: 'Dramatic, Emotional, or Erratic'</th><th>Cluster C: 'Anxious and Fearful'</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td><ul><li>Paranoid</li><li>Schizoid</li><li>Schizotypal</td><td></li><li>Antisocial</li><li>Borderline (Emotionally Unstable)</li><li>Histrionic</li><li>Narcissistic</td><td></li><li>Obsessive-Compulsive</li><li>Avoidant </li><li>Dependent</td></tr></tbody></table></div></li></ul><br /><br /><b>Cluster A: 'Odd or Eccentric'</b><br /><br /><span class=\"concept\" data-cid=\"6492\">Paranoid</span><br /><ul><li>\t<span class=\"concept\" data-cid=\"5195\">Hypersensitivity and an unforgiving attitude when insulted</span></li><li>\tUnwarranted tendency to questions the loyalty of friends</li><li>\tReluctance to confide in others</li><li>\tPreoccupation with conspirational beliefs and hidden meaning</li><li>\tUnwarranted tendency to perceive attacks on their character</li></ul><br /><span class=\"concept\" data-cid=\"6493\">Schizoid</span><br /><ul><li>\tIndifference to praise and criticism</li><li>\t<span class=\"concept\" data-cid=\"4103\">Preference for solitary activities</span></li><li>\t<span class=\"concept\" data-cid=\"4103\">Lack of interest in sexual interactions</span></li><li>\tLack of desire for companionship</li><li>\tEmotional coldness</li><li>\tFew interests</li><li>\tFew friends or confidants other than family</li></ul><br /><span class=\"concept\" data-cid=\"6494\">Schizotypal</span><br /><ul><li>\tIdeas of reference (differ from delusions in that some insight is retained)</li><li>\t<span class=\"concept\" data-cid=\"1845\">Odd beliefs</span> and magical thinking</li><li>\tUnusual perceptual disturbances</li><li>\tParanoid ideation and suspiciousness</li><li>\tOdd, eccentric behaviour</li><li>\t<span class=\"concept\" data-cid=\"8949\">Lack of close friends</span> other than family members</li><li>\tInappropriate affect</li><li>\tOdd speech without being incoherent</li></ul><br /><br /><b>Cluster B: 'Dramatic, Emotional, or Erratic' </b><br /><br /><span class=\"concept\" data-cid=\"6485\">Antisocial</span><br /><ul><li><span class=\"concept\" data-cid=\"5189\">Failure to conform to social norms</span> with respect to lawful behaviours as indicated by repeatedly performing acts that are grounds for arrest;</li><li><span class=\"concept\" data-cid=\"1845\">More common in men</span>;</li><li>Deception, as indicated by repeatedly lying, use of aliases, or conning others for personal profit or pleasure;

            "<b>Roseola infantum is correct</b> because this condition, caused by human herpesvirus 6 (HHV-6), typically affects children aged 6\u201324 months. It is characterised by a sudden high fever lasting 3\u20135 days, followed by the appearance of a rose-pink maculopapular rash that starts on the trunk and spreads to the neck and limbs once the fever resolves. The infant's well appearance despite the rash is a key diagnostic feature.<br /><br /><b>Chickenpox (varicella) is incorrect</b> because chickenpox presents with a vesicular rash that appears in crops, not after the fever resolves. Chickenpox is also associated with malaise and itching.<br /><br /><b>Measles is incorrect</b> because its rash appears alongside fever and other symptoms such as conjunctivitis and cough. The rash in measles spreads differently, starting on the face and spreading downward.",

The progression of the rash over four days, becoming confluent on the face, and the presence of respiratory symptoms like cough and nasal congestion confirm the diagnosis.

        "body": "Erythema infectiosum (also known as fifth disease or 'slapped-cheek syndrome') is caused by <span class=\"concept\" data-cid=\"10655\">parvovirus B19</span>.<br /><br />The illness may consist of a mild feverish illness which is hardly noticeable. However, in others there is a noticeable rash which appears after a few days. The rose-red rash makes the cheeks appear bright red, hence the name '<span class=\"concept\" data-cid=\"12525\">slapped cheek</span> syndrome'. The rash may spread to the rest of the body but unlike many other rashes, it only rarely involves the palms and soles.<br /><br />The child begins to feel better as the rash appears and the rash usually peaks after a week and then fades. The rash is unusual in that for some months afterwards, a warm bath, sunlight, heat or fever will trigger a recurrence of the bright red cheeks and the rash itself. Most children recover and need no specific treatment. In adults, the virus may cause acute arthritis.<br /><br />Be aware that the virus can affect an unborn baby in the first 20 weeks of pregnancy. If a woman is exposed early in pregnancy (before 20 weeks) she should seek prompt advice from whoever is giving her antenatal care.<br />It is spread by the respiratory route and a person is infectious 3 to 5 days before the appearance of the rash. Children are no longer infectious once the rash appears and there is no specific treatment.<br /><br />The child need not be excluded from school as they are no longer infectious by the time the rash occurs.",
