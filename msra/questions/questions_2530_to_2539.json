            "The correct answer is <b>Weight gain</b>. Atypical antipsychotics, also known as second-generation antipsychotics, are more associated with weight gain than conventional or first-generation antipsychotics. This side effect is particularly common with medications such as olanzapine and clozapine. The mechanism of weight gain involves the antagonism of serotonin 5-HT2C and histamine H1 receptors, resulting in increased appetite and reduced satiety.<br /><br /><b>Akathisia</b> is a condition characterised by motor restlessness and a compulsion to move. It's more commonly associated with the use of first-generation antipsychotics due to their high D2 receptor blockade which can cause extrapyramidal symptoms, including akathisia. While it can occur with atypical antipsychotics, the incidence is lower compared to conventional ones.<br /><br /><b>Galactorrhoea</b>, or inappropriate lactation, occurs due to elevated prolactin levels. Both atypical and typical antipsychotics can cause hyperprolactinaemia, but this side effect is less common with atypical agents because they have less dopamine D2 receptor blockade in the tuberoinfundibular pathway where prolactin secretion is regulated.<br /><br /><b>Parkinsonism</b> refers to symptoms that mimic Parkinson's disease such as bradykinesia, rigidity, tremor and postural instability. These symptoms are more likely to be seen with first-generation antipsychotics due to their strong dopamine D2 receptor antagonism which affects the nigrostriatal pathway involved in motor control.<br /><br />Lastly, <b>Tardive dyskinesia</b>, characterised by repetitive involuntary movements especially around the mouth area (e.g., grimacing), is another extrapyramidal symptom that's more frequently observed with conventional rather than atypical antipsychotics. This is because typical agents have a higher affinity for D2 receptors and a longer duration of D2 blockade compared to atypical agents.<br />",

Anterior uveitis is characterised by symptoms of a painful red eye with photophobia. Visual loss is more variable and can include reduced visual acuity, blurred vision, or reduced peripheral fields.

This may be secondary to viral, bacterial, or allergic causes with symptoms including erythematous and inflamed conjunctiva with a watery discharge (or purulent in cases of bacterial disease).

            "<b>Post-bronchodilator spirometry</b> is the correct answer. This patient presents with classic features suggestive of COPD: she is over 35 years old, has a significant smoking history, presents with exertional breathlessness, and her chest radiograph shows hyperinflation consistent with COPD. According to NICE guidelines, post-bronchodilator spirometry is essential to confirm the diagnosis of COPD by demonstrating airflow obstruction (FEV1/FVC ratio less than 70%). The bronchodilator component is crucial as it helps differentiate COPD from asthma by showing irreversible airflow obstruction. A chest radiograph alone cannot diagnose COPD, though it helps exclude alternative diagnoses such as lung cancer and provides supportive features. Spirometry must be performed after administering a bronchodilator to ensure accurate assessment of the degree of reversibility and to properly stage the disease severity.<br /><br /><b>CT chest</b> is not the next appropriate investigation. While CT scanning can provide detailed imaging of the lungs and may be useful in assessing complications of COPD such as bullae, bronchiectasis, or excluding malignancy, it is not required to make the initial diagnosis of COPD. Spirometry remains the gold standard diagnostic test. CT chest would be considered if there were atypical features, diagnostic uncertainty, or if surgical intervention such as bullectomy or lung volume reduction surgery were being considered.<br /><br /><b>Full blood count</b> is a useful investigation in the assessment of COPD patients, particularly to identify secondary polycythaemia which can occur in chronic hypoxia. However, it is not the next most appropriate investigation as it does not establish the diagnosis. NICE guidelines recommend FBC as part of the initial assessment once COPD is suspected, but spirometry takes priority as the diagnostic test. The FBC would typically be performed alongside other baseline investigations after spirometry confirms the diagnosis.<br /><br /><b>Peak expiratory flow</b> is not appropriate for diagnosing COPD. NICE guidelines specifically state that measuring peak expiratory flow is of limited value in COPD as it may underestimate the degree of airflow obstruction. Peak flow measurements are more useful in the diagnosis and monitoring of asthma. In COPD, the pathophysiology involves small airway collapse and air trapping, which is better assessed through spirometry measuring FEV1 and FVC rather than peak flow alone.<br /><br /><b>Transfer factor</b> (TLCO) can be useful in the assessment of breathlessness and may help differentiate COPD from other causes of breathlessness such as interstitial lung disease or pulmonary vascular disease. It may also be reduced in emphysema-predominant COPD. However, it is not required to make the initial diagnosis of COPD and would typically be performed after spirometry if there were diagnostic uncertainty or to further characterise the disease phenotype.",
