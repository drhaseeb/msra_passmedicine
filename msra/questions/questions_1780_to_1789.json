            "The correct answer is <b>36 hours</b>. Alcohol withdrawal seizures typically peak around 24-48 hours after the last drink, with 36 hours representing the most common timepoint for seizure occurrence. These seizures are a manifestation of central nervous system hyperexcitability that develops as the brain adjusts to the absence of alcohol's depressant effects. In a patient with significant alcohol consumption (120 units weekly indicates alcohol dependence), withdrawal symptoms follow a predictable timeline, with seizures being a serious complication in the intermediate phase of withdrawal. These seizures are typically generalised tonic-clonic in nature and may occur in clusters. Prophylactic benzodiazepines are the mainstay of treatment to prevent withdrawal seizures in at-risk patients.<br /><br /><b>2 hours</b> is incorrect as this timeframe is too early for alcohol withdrawal seizures. At 2 hours after the last drink, blood alcohol levels may still be elevated, and the central nervous system has not yet developed the hyperexcitability that leads to seizures. Early withdrawal symptoms at this stage typically include tremor, anxiety, and autonomic instability rather than seizures.<br /><br /><b>6 hours</b> is incorrect because this is still within the early phase of alcohol withdrawal. While minor withdrawal symptoms such as tremor, anxiety, headache, and diaphoresis may begin 6-8 hours after the last drink, seizures are uncommon at this early stage. The neuroadaptive changes that predispose to seizures have not fully developed by this point.<br /><br /><b>12 hours</b> is incorrect as this remains too early for the peak incidence of withdrawal seizures. At 12 hours, patients are typically experiencing progressive early withdrawal symptoms, but the peak risk period for seizures has not yet been reached. Some patients may begin to experience hallucinations at this stage, particularly visual hallucinations, but seizures typically occur later.<br /><br /><b>24 hours</b> is incorrect, although this is approaching the timeframe when seizures become more common. While seizures can certainly occur at 24 hours post-cessation, the peak incidence is slightly later, around 36 hours. The 24-hour mark often represents the beginning of the highest risk period for seizures rather than the peak itself.",

It provides a protective effect that persists for many years after discontinuing its use. This is due to the progestogen component of the COC pill which counteracts the proliferative effect of oestrogen on the endometrium, thus reducing the risk of endometrial hyperplasia and subsequent malignancy.<br /><br /><b>Diabetes mellitus</b> is a well-established risk factor for endometrial cancer. Insulin resistance and hyperinsulinaemia, common in type 2 diabetes, can lead to increased levels of circulating oestrogens which stimulate endometrial proliferation.<br /><br />Similarly, <b>Late menopause</b> increases exposure to oestrogens without corresponding progesterone, leading to unopposed stimulation of the endometrium and increasing the risk of developing endometrial cancer.<br /><br /><b>Obesity</b> also contributes significantly to the development of endometrial cancer. Adipose tissue can convert androstenedione into estrone, a potent oestrogen. In post-menopausal women who have no natural progesterone production from ovaries, this leads to unopposed oestrogenic stimulation of the endometrium.<br /><br />Finally, <b>nulliparity</b>, or never having given birth, increases a woman's risk for developing endometrial cancer. Pregnancy results in long periods without ovulation and therefore less exposure to cyclical oestrogens.

            "The correct answer is <b>Temperature of 39.5\u00baC</b>. Ecstasy, also known as MDMA (3,4-methylenedioxymethamphetamine), is a synthetic psychoactive drug that can cause a range of physical and psychological effects. One of the most characteristic features of ecstasy use is hyperthermia, with body temperatures often exceeding 39\u00baC. This occurs due to increased serotonin release in the hypothalamus, which regulates body temperature. Additionally, the use of ecstasy in club settings where users are dancing and overheating can exacerbate this effect.<br /><br /><b>Respiratory depression</b> is not typically associated with ecstasy use; instead, it is more commonly seen in opioid overdose or sedative-hypnotic intoxication. Ecstasy tends to have a stimulant effect on the respiratory system rather than causing respiratory depression.<br /><br /><b>Hypernatraemia</b>, or high serum sodium levels, may be indirectly related to ecstasy use if an individual becomes dehydrated due to excessive sweating and inadequate fluid intake while using the drug. However, this would not be a direct effect of the drug itself and therefore would not be considered a key feature pointing towards ecstasy use.<br /><br /><b>Miosis</b>, or constriction of the pupils, is another feature not typically associated with ecstasy use. In fact, ecstasy often causes mydriasis (dilation of the pupils) due to its stimulant effects on the sympathetic nervous system. Miosis can be observed in cases of opioid overdose or exposure to cholinergic agents such as organophosphates.<br /><br />Finally, <b>urinary incontinence</b> is also not a typical feature associated with ecstasy use. While urinary retention may occur due to increased adrenergic activity caused by MDMA's stimulant properties, this would usually result in difficulty passing urine rather than involuntary loss of bladder control.",
