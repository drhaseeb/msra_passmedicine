            "<b>Contrast-enhanced CT scan</b> is the most appropriate initial investigation for this patient presenting with features highly suspicious of pancreatic cancer. The clinical presentation of painless jaundice, weight loss, and a palpable gallbladder (Courvoisier's sign) in an elderly patient strongly suggests a pancreatic head malignancy. Contrast-enhanced CT with pancreatic protocol is the gold standard first-line imaging modality for suspected pancreatic cancer according to UK guidelines. It provides detailed information about the primary tumour, local invasion, vascular involvement, and distant metastases, which are crucial for staging and determining resectability. CT has a sensitivity of 89-97% for detecting pancreatic tumours and allows for comprehensive assessment of the disease in a single examination. The National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) recommends contrast-enhanced CT as the initial investigation for suspected pancreatic cancer.<br /><br /><b>Abdominal ultrasound</b> is often used as a screening tool in patients with jaundice, but it has limitations in visualizing the pancreas due to overlying bowel gas and patient body habitus. While it may detect biliary dilatation and occasionally identify pancreatic masses, its sensitivity for pancreatic cancer ranges from 60-90%, which is inferior to CT scanning. Ultrasound would be a reasonable initial test in a less suspicious presentation or as a quick screening tool, but given this patient's high pre-test probability of pancreatic cancer, proceeding directly to CT is more appropriate.<br /><br /><b>Endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP)</b> is primarily a therapeutic procedure rather than a diagnostic one for suspected pancreatic cancer. While it can provide biliary decompression through stent placement and allow for brushings or biopsies, it carries risks including pancreatitis, bleeding, and perforation. ERCP would typically be performed after cross-sectional imaging has confirmed a diagnosis and if biliary drainage is required, not as the first-line investigation.<br /><br /><b>Magnetic resonance cholangiopancreatography (MRCP)</b> provides excellent visualization of the biliary and pancreatic ducts and can detect small tumours, but it is generally considered complementary to CT rather than a replacement. MRCP may be particularly useful for patients who cannot receive iodinated contrast or when further characterization of indeterminate findings on CT is needed. However, it does not provide the same level of detail regarding vascular involvement and metastatic disease as contrast-enhanced CT.<br /><br /><b>Endoscopic ultrasound (EUS)</b> is highly sensitive for detecting small pancreatic lesions and allows for tissue sampling via fine-needle aspiration. While it has excellent sensitivity (up to 98%) for pancreatic tumours, it is typically used as a second-line investigation after CT scanning, particularly for tissue diagnosis or when CT findings are equivocal. EUS is invasive, operator-dependent, and not as widely available as CT scanning, making it less suitable as an initial investigation.",

            "The correct answer is <b>Chondromalacia patellae</b>. This condition, also known as 'runner's knee,' is a common cause of anterior knee pain in adolescents and young adults. It occurs when the cartilage on the underside of the patella (kneecap) becomes softened and irritated, often due to overuse or poor alignment of the patella. The pain typically worsens with activities that involve bending the knee, such as walking up and down stairs, squatting, or running.<br /><br /><b>Osteoarthritis</b> is an unlikely diagnosis in this case because it typically affects older individuals and involves degenerative changes in the joint cartilage. Additionally, osteoarthritis usually presents with stiffness and pain that worsens throughout the day or after periods of rest.<br /><br /><b>Osgood-Schlatter disease</b> is a common cause of knee pain in growing adolescents but typically presents with localized pain and swelling at the tibial tuberosity (the bony prominence just below the kneecap). The patient's symptoms do not fit this description.<br /><br /><b>Osteogenesis imperfecta</b> is a genetic disorder characterized by fragile bones that break easily. While patients with osteogenesis imperfecta may experience joint pain, their primary symptom is recurrent fractures with minimal trauma. There is no history of fractures mentioned in this case.<br /><br />Finally, <b>Osteochondritis dissecans</b> refers to a condition where small fragments of bone and cartilage become detached from their surrounding tissue due to inadequate blood supply. This can cause joint pain and swelling; however, it typically affects children between 10-20 years old who are involved in high-impact sports like football or gymnastics.
