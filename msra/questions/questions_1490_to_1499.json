            "The correct answer is that U waves would be seen on the ECG. Hypokalaemia, which is present in this case (K+ 2.2 mmol/l), characteristically causes U waves to appear on the ECG. U waves are small positive deflections that follow the T wave and are best seen in leads V2 and V3. The patient's low potassium is likely due to thiazide diuretic therapy (bendroflumethiazide), which is a common cause of hypokalaemia. Other ECG changes associated with hypokalaemia include T wave flattening, ST segment depression, and prominent U waves.<br /><br /><b>Short PR interval</b> is not correct as this is typically associated with pre-excitation syndromes such as Wolff-Parkinson-White syndrome, rather than electrolyte disturbances. A normal PR interval is 120-200ms.<br /><br /><b>Short QT interval</b> is incorrect. While electrolyte disturbances can affect the QT interval, hypokalaemia typically causes QT interval prolongation rather than shortening. Short QT interval is seen in hypercalcaemia.<br /><br /><b>Delta waves</b> are also incorrect. Delta waves are a feature of Wolff-Parkinson-White syndrome, where there is pre-excitation of the ventricles via an accessory pathway.

In the case of anaphylaxis, the UK Resuscitation Council guidelines recommend that a further dose of intramuscular adrenaline can be given if there is no improvement in symptoms within 5 minutes after the initial dose. This is because adrenaline has a rapid onset of action, and if no improvement is seen within this timeframe, it may be necessary to repeat the dose to ensure adequate treatment.<br /><br />The first incorrect answer is <b>3 minutes</b>. While adrenaline does have a rapid onset of action, waiting for at least 5 minutes allows enough time to assess the patient's response to the initial dose.

In a patient with ventricular fibrillation who has already received three cycles of cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) and intravenous adrenaline, the UK Resuscitation Council guidelines recommend administering an initial dose of 300 mg amiodarone.
