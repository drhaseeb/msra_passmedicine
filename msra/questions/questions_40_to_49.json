One common way this can occur is as a consequence of congestive heart failure. In severe cases cirrhosis may occur.</td></tr><tr><td><b>Biliary colic</b></td><td>RUQ pain, intermittent, usually begins abruptly and subsides gradually. Attacks often occur after eating. Nausea is common.<br /><br />It is sometimes taught that patients are female, forties, fat and fair although this is obviously a generalisation.</td></tr><tr><td><b>Acute cholecystitis </b></td><td>Pain similar to biliary colic but more severe and persistent. The pain may radiate to the back or right shoulder. <br /><br />The patient may be pyrexial and Murphy's sign positive (arrest of inspiration on palpation of the RUQ)</td></tr><tr><td><b>Ascending cholangitis</b></td><td>An infection of the bile ducts commonly secondary to gallstones. Classically presents with a triad of:<br /><ul><li>fever (rigors are common)</li><li>RUQ pain</li><li>jaundice</td></tr><tr><td></li></ul><b>Gallstone ileus</b></td><td>This describes small bowel obstruction secondary to an impacted gallstone. It may develop if a fistula forms between a gangrenous gallbladder and the duodenum.<br /><br />Abdominal pain, distension and vomiting are seen.</td></tr><tr><td><b>Cholangiocarcinoma</b></td><td>Persistent biliary colic symptoms, associated with anorexia, jaundice and weight loss. A palpable mass in the right upper quadrant (Courvoisier sign), periumbilical lymphadenopathy (Sister Mary Joseph nodes) and left supraclavicular adenopathy (Virchow node) may be seen</td></tr><tr><td><b>Acute pancreatitis</b></td><td>Usually due to alcohol or gallstones<br />Severe epigastric pain<br />Vomiting is common<br />Examination may reveal tenderness, ileus and low-grade fever<br />Periumbilical discolouration (Cullen's sign) and flank discolouration (Grey-Turner's sign) is described but rare</td></tr><tr><td><b>Pancreatic cancer</b></td><td>Painless jaundice is the classical presentation of pancreatic cancer. However pain is actually a relatively common presenting symptom of pancreatic cancer. Anorexia and weight loss are common</td></tr><tr><td><b>Amoebic liver abscess</b></td><td>Typical symptoms are malaise, anorexia and weight loss. The associated RUQ pain tends to be mild and jaundice is uncommon.</td></tr></tbody></table></div>",

            "<b>Anal fissure</b> is the correct answer. An anal fissure refers to a tear in the anorectal mucosa, commonly resulting from the passage of hard or large stools. It is characterised by severe pain during defecation and bright red blood per rectum. The discomfort may continue for several hours subsequent to defecation. Anal fissures tend to occur more frequently in younger populations and represent a prevalent cause of painful rectal bleeding.<br /><br /><b>Anal abscess</b> is incorrect. While an anal abscess can lead to rectal pain and discomfort, its clinical presentation often includes fever, oedema, and localised pain around the anal region. Rectal bleeding might ensue if there is abscess rupture; however, it typically does not feature as the primary symptom. The description of severe pain during bowel movements accompanied by bright red rectal bleeding points towards a different diagnosis.<br /><br /><b>Colorectal cancer</b> is incorrect.  Symptoms associated with colorectal cancer are diverse and can include altered bowel habits, weight loss, and anaemia alongside rectal bleeding. Considering the patient's presenting symptoms, colorectal cancer appears less probable as an underlying cause.<br /><br /><b>Diverticulitis</b> is incorrect. Diverticulitis generally presents with clinical features including abdominal pain, pyrexia, nausea, and alterations in bowel habits. Although it may be associated with rectal bleeding, it seldom presents with severe pain during defecation or bright red haematochezia. Furthermore, diverticulitis is less common among younger individuals; thus it is unlikely to be implicated in this patient's presentation.<br /><br /><b>Thrombosed haemorrhoids</b> is incorrect. Thrombosed haemorrhoids are known to cause rectal bleeding and discomfort; however, they usually result in dark red or maroon-coloured blood loss. Additionally, while painfulness can accompany haemorrhoids, they do not typically induce intense pain that persists for hours following bowel movements.",

            "The correct answer is Insomnia. Prolonged corticosteroid therapy, such as prednisolone, commonly causes sleep disturbances, particularly insomnia. This occurs due to the disruption of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis and alterations in circadian rhythm. Glucocorticoids affect both slow-wave sleep and REM sleep patterns, and evening doses particularly can lead to difficulty initiating and maintaining sleep. This side effect is frequently reported by patients on long-term steroid therapy and can significantly impact quality of life.<br /><br /><b>Thrombocytopaenia</b> is not typically associated with corticosteroid use. In fact, glucocorticoids can cause thrombocytosis rather than thrombocytopaenia, as they stimulate thrombopoiesis and increase platelet survival time.<br /><br /><b>Hypotension</b> is incorrect as corticosteroids typically cause hypertension rather than hypotension. This occurs through various mechanisms including increased sodium retention, enhanced vascular responsiveness to vasoconstrictors, and suppression of vasodilator systems.<br /><br /><b>Bronchospasm</b> is not associated with corticosteroid therapy. Conversely, corticosteroids are used to treat bronchospasm in conditions such as asthma due to their potent anti-inflammatory effects and ability to reduce bronchial hyperresponsiveness.<br /><br /><b>Hyperkalaemia</b> is incorrect as corticosteroids typically cause hypokalaemia rather than hyperkalaemia. This occurs due to their mineralocorticoid effects, which promote potassium excretion and sodium retention in the distal tubules of the kidney.",

            "The correct answer to this question is <b>Up to 6 months</b>. Finasteride, a 5-alpha reductase inhibitor, is used in the treatment of benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH) and its effectiveness can take up to six months. This is because finasteride works by inhibiting the conversion of testosterone into dihydrotestosterone (DHT), which contributes to prostate enlargement. The reduction in prostate size and associated symptom relief, therefore, takes some time.<br /><br />The first option, <b>Within 8 hours of taking the tablet</b>, is incorrect. Finasteride does not provide immediate relief from BPH symptoms. While it starts reducing DHT levels soon after ingestion, it takes longer for this to translate into symptomatic relief.<br /><br />The second option, <b>Within 3 days</b>, is also incorrect for similar reasons. Although finasteride begins working fairly quickly at a hormonal level, this does not mean that patients will experience immediate symptom relief within such a short timeframe.<br /><br />Similarly, the third option, <b>Up to 7 days</b>, is incorrect as well. Even though finasteride may start lowering DHT levels within a week of initiating therapy, significant symptom improvement typically takes longer.<br /><br />The fourth option, <b>Up to 4 weeks</b>, while closer to the correct answer than the previous options, is still not accurate. Some patients may begin noticing some improvement in their BPH symptoms within one month of starting finasteride; however, according to UK guidelines on BPH management and multiple clinical studies on finasteride use in BPH treatment, most patients need up to six months of continuous therapy before experiencing notable symptom relief.",
