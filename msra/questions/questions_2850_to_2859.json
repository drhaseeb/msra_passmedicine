            "The correct answer is <b>Febrile convulsions</b>. Roseola infantum, also known as sixth disease, is a common viral illness of infancy caused by human herpesvirus 6 (HHV-6) and less frequently by HHV-7. It is characterised by a high fever followed by a characteristic rash. The most common complication associated with roseola infantum in children is febrile convulsions due to the rapid rise in body temperature. Febrile convulsions are seizures that occur between the ages of 6 months and 5 years, triggered by fever. They are usually benign and self-limiting.<br /><br />The option <b>Transient synovitis</b>, also known as toxic synovitis or irritable hip, is an inflammation and swelling of the tissues around the hip joint and is the most common cause of sudden hip pain in children. However, it's not typically associated with roseola infantum.<br /><br /><b>Otitis media with effusion</b>, often referred to as glue ear, involves the build-up of fluid within the middle ear space leading to hearing loss. While otitis media with effusion can occur secondary to viral infections, it's not a common complication of roseola infantum specifically.<br /><br /><b>Pneumonia</b> refers to inflammation of the tissue in one or both lungs that's usually caused by an infection. Pneumonia can be a serious condition but it isn't generally seen as a complication from roseola infantum.<br /><br />Finally, <b>Orchitis</b> is inflammation of one or both testicles in males, often caused by an infection such as mumps virus. As this patient is female and orchitis primarily affects males, this would not be applicable here nor is it commonly linked with roseola infantum.",

        "body": "A scaphoid fracture is a type of wrist fracture, typically arises as a result of a fall onto an outstretched hand (FOOSH). This results in axial compression of the scaphoid, with the wrist hyperextended, and radially deviated.

The toxins are rendered harmless (detoxified) and used as antigens in the vaccine. When the immune system encounters these non-toxic toxoids, it learns to combat the natural toxins the bacteria produce, providing immunity against the toxic effects of infections</li><li>toxoid vaccines often require booster doses to maintain immunity since, like inactivated vaccines, the immune response they induce can wane over time</li><li>examples:<ul><li><span class=\"concept\" data-cid=\"6352\">tetanus</span></li><li><span class=\"concept\" data-cid=\"6353\">diphtheria</span></li><li><span class=\"concept\" data-cid=\"6354\">pertussis</span></li></ul></li></ul><br />Subunit and conjugate vaccines are often grouped together.
