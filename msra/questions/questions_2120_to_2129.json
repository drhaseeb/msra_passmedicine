            "<b>An increased risk of serotonin syndrome</b> is the correct answer. Triptans are synthetic serotonin receptor agonists and so in combination with selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) can increase the risk of serotonin syndrome, which is potentially life-threatening.

They do not, however, state that triptans are absolutely contra-indicated in combination with SSRIs.<br /><br /><b>An increased risk of bleeding events</b> is incorrect.

            "The correct answer is <b>Between fifth and ninth day of life</b>. The neonatal blood spot screening test, also known as the 'heel prick' test, is typically performed between the fifth and ninth day of life in the United Kingdom. This timing allows for optimal detection of the five rare but serious health conditions that this test screens for: sickle cell disease, cystic fibrosis, congenital hypothyroidism, phenylketonuria (PKU), and medium-chain acyl-CoA dehydrogenase deficiency (MCADD). Performing the test within this timeframe ensures that any necessary treatment can be started as soon as possible while minimising the chance of false positive results.<br /><br /><b>At birth</b> is incorrect because immediate testing at birth does not give accurate results. For instance, newborns with phenylketonuria might still have a normal level of phenylalanine at birth due to maternal metabolism during pregnancy. Therefore, testing immediately after birth could miss such cases.<br /><br />The option <b>On first day of life</b> is also incorrect. Although some conditions like congenital hypothyroidism can be detected on the first day after birth, others like PKU need more time to develop detectable levels in the blood.<br /><br />Similarly, <b>On fourth day of life</b> is too early for reliable detection of all five conditions screened by this test. While it might potentially identify some conditions like MCADD or sickle cell disease, it may not accurately detect others like PKU or cystic fibrosis.<br /><br />Lastly, performing the screening <b>Any time in first month of life</b> is incorrect because delaying beyond nine days could lead to late diagnosis and treatment initiation for these conditions. Specifically for conditions like PKU or MCADD where early dietary interventions can prevent severe consequences such as irreversible intellectual disability or metabolic crises respectively, it's crucial to screen within the recommended timeframe.",
