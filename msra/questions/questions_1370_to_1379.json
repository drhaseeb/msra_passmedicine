            "<b>Topical antibiotic with corticosteroid drops</b> is the correct answer and represents first-line treatment for otitis externa according to UK guidelines. This patient presents with classical features of otitis externa following swimming exposure: ear discomfort, discharge, and a red, swollen external auditory canal. The combination of a topical antibiotic (targeting common bacterial pathogens such as <i>Staphylococcus aureus</i> and <i>Pseudomonas aeruginosa</i>) with a corticosteroid provides both antimicrobial cover and anti-inflammatory effects to reduce canal oedema and discomfort. The intact tympanic membrane means there are no contraindications to aminoglycoside-containing preparations, though this remains debated among ENT specialists. A topical antibiotic alone would also be acceptable first-line treatment, but the combined preparation offers additional symptomatic benefit through the steroid component. If canal debris is extensive, removal should be considered to improve drug penetration, and if the canal is very swollen, an ear wick may facilitate delivery of topical treatment.<br /><br /><b>Topical acetic acid spray</b> can be used for otitis externa, particularly as prophylaxis in recurrent cases or for very mild infections, as it creates an acidic environment that inhibits bacterial growth. However, it is not considered first-line treatment when there is established infection with clear inflammatory signs as described in this scenario. Acetic acid may cause stinging and discomfort, and is less effective than topical antibiotics for treating active infection. It has a role in prevention rather than treatment of established disease.<br /><br /><b>Oral flucloxacillin</b> is reserved for cases where infection is spreading beyond the ear canal, such as when there is cellulitis of the pinna or periauricular tissues, or in malignant otitis externa. This patient has localised disease confined to the external auditory canal with no features suggesting spread of infection. Oral antibiotics are considered second-line treatment and should not be used routinely for uncomplicated otitis externa. Systemic antibiotics also carry greater risk of adverse effects and contribute to antimicrobial resistance when used unnecessarily.<br /><br /><b>Ear canal swab for culture</b> is not required as initial management for straightforward otitis externa. Swabs should be considered if the patient fails to respond to first-line topical treatment, if there are unusual features, or if fungal infection is suspected. Taking a swab at initial presentation would delay treatment and is not cost-effective given that most cases respond well to empirical topical antibiotic therapy. The microbiology results would typically take several days to return, by which time the patient should already be improving with appropriate topical treatment.<br /><br /><b>Topical antifungal drops</b> would be appropriate if fungal otitis externa (otomycosis) was suspected, typically presenting with intense itching and characteristic white or black fungal debris visible on otoscopy. However, this is not first-line treatment for acute otitis externa. Antifungal agents are considered second-line when there is failure to respond to antibacterial treatment, or when clinical features specifically suggest fungal infection.

            "<b>Switch to oestrogen-only preparation</b> is the correct answer. This patient has had a hysterectomy and therefore has no uterus. The primary reason for adding a progestogen to HRT is to protect the endometrium from the proliferative effects of unopposed oestrogen, which increases the risk of endometrial cancer. In women without a uterus, there is no endometrium to protect, so progestogen is unnecessary. Furthermore, the addition of a progestogen increases the risk of breast cancer compared to oestrogen-only HRT. The Women's Health Initiative study demonstrated that combined HRT carries a higher breast cancer risk (relative risk 1.26 at 5 years) compared to oestrogen alone. Since this patient has no medical indication for progestogen therapy, she should be switched to an oestrogen-only preparation to reduce her breast cancer risk whilst maintaining symptom control.<br /><br /><b>Continue combined oestrogen and progestogen</b> is incorrect because this patient is receiving unnecessary progestogen therapy. She has had a hysterectomy and therefore does not require endometrial protection. Continuing combined therapy exposes her to an increased risk of breast cancer without any clinical benefit. The progestogen component should be discontinued.<br /><br /><b>Switch to transdermal combined preparation</b> is incorrect. Whilst transdermal preparations have advantages in terms of reduced VTE risk, this patient still does not require a progestogen component. Switching to a transdermal combined preparation would still expose her to the increased breast cancer risk associated with progestogen use. The route of administration does not address the fundamental issue that she is receiving unnecessary progestogen.<br /><br /><b>Add cyclical progestogen to oestrogen</b> is incorrect and would actually worsen the situation. This patient is already receiving progestogen unnecessarily. Adding or modifying the progestogen regimen does not address the core problem. Whether progestogen is given cyclically or continuously, it still increases breast cancer risk in women who do not require endometrial protection.<br /><br /><b>Switch to tibolone</b> is incorrect. Tibolone is a synthetic steroid with oestrogenic, progestogenic and androgenic properties. Whilst it is an alternative HRT option, it still has progestogenic effects and therefore carries similar breast cancer risks to combined HRT. For a woman without a uterus, oestrogen-only therapy remains the most appropriate choice as it provides effective symptom relief with a lower breast cancer risk profile.",

It may seem paradoxical that a thiazide diuretic would be a treatment for this condition as polyuria is a symptom of the disorder. <br /><br />In simple terms DI leads to the production of vast amounts of dilute urine which is dehydrating and raises the plasma osmolarity, stimulating thirst.

            "The correct answer is <b>Endometrial cancer</b>. The combined oral contraceptive pill has been found to significantly reduce the risk of endometrial cancer. This protection increases with the duration of use and continues for many years after stopping the pill. The mechanism behind this protective effect is thought to be due to the progestogen component of the pill which opposes oestrogen's proliferative effect on the endometrium, thus reducing hyperplasia and subsequent malignant transformation.<br /><br /><b>Stroke</b>, on the other hand, is not less common in women who take combined oral contraceptives. In fact, these pills can slightly increase the risk of stroke, particularly ischemic stroke. This increased risk is primarily seen in women with additional risk factors such as hypertension, smoking, obesity or older age.<br /><br />Similarly, <b>Pulmonary embolism</b> is also more common in women taking combined oral contraceptives. The hormones in these pills can increase the coagulability of blood leading to a higher risk of venous thromboembolism including pulmonary embolism.<br /><br />The relationship between combined oral contraceptive use and <b>Cervical cancer</b> is complex. While some studies suggest an increased risk with long-term use (over 5 years), others have found no significant association when adjusted for human papillomavirus (HPV) infection status - a key cause of cervical cancer. Therefore, it cannot be said definitively that cervical cancer is less common in women who take combined oral contraceptives.<br /><br />Lastly, <b>Ischaemic heart disease</b> is not less common among users of combined oral contraceptives either. Similar to stroke, these pills can slightly increase the risk of ischemic heart disease, especially in the presence of other cardiovascular risk factors like smoking or high blood pressure.",
