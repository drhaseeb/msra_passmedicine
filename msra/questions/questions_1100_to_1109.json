        "body": "Iron deficiency anaemia is the most common anaemia worldwide. Iron is needed to make the haemoglobin in red blood cells, therefore a deficiency of iron leads to a reduction in red blood cells/haemoglobin i.e. anaemia. Iron deficiency anaemia has the highest incidence amongst preschool-age children. The main causes are excessive blood loss, inadequate dietary intake, poor intestinal absorption and increased iron requirements.<br /><br />Epidemiology<br /><ul><li>Globally, iron deficiency is the most common cause of anaemia</li><li>Preschool-age children have the highest prevalence of iron deficiency anaemia</li></ul><br />Causes<br /><ul><li>Excessive blood loss: blood loss due to menorrhagia is the most common cause in pre-menopausal women, whereas gastrointestinal bleeding is the most common cause in men (always suspect colon cancer) and post-menopausal women. </li><li>Inadequate dietary intake: as meat is a good source of iron, vegans and vegetarians are more likely to develop iron deficiency anaemia due to a lack of meat in their diet. However dark green leafy vegetables are another good source of iron, therefore people who don't eat meat can still receive enough iron through purely dietary sources.</li><li>Poor intestinal absorption: conditions which affect the small intestine, such as coeliac disease, can prevent sufficient iron being absorbed.</li><li>Increased iron requirements: children have increased iron demands during periods of rapid growth. Women also have increased demands during pregnancy as the baby will receive their iron supply from the mother. In addition, an increase in plasma volume during pregnancy causes iron deficiency anaemia through dilution i.e. the proportion of fluid in comparison to red blood cells increases.</li></ul><br />Features<br /><ul><li>Fatigue</li><li>Shortness of breath on exertion</li><li>Palpitations</li><li>Pallor</li><li>Nail changes: this includes <span class=\"concept\" data-cid=\"11748\">koilonychia (spoon-shaped nails)</span></li><li>Hair loss</li><li>Atrophic glossitis</li><li>Post-cricoid webs</li><li>Angular stomatitis</li></ul><br />Investigations<br /><ul><li>Taking a history is the most important step in looking for potential causes of iron deficiency. It is useful to inquire about: changes in diet, medication history, menstrual history, weight loss, change in bowel habit</li><li>Full blood count (FBC) <i>demonstrates hypochromic microcytic anaemia</i></li><li>Serum ferritin <i>this will likely be low, as serum ferritin correlates with iron stores. However, it is important to recognise that ferritin can be raised during states of inflammation; so a raised ferritin does not necessarily rule out iron deficiency anaemia if the is co-occurring inflammation. For patients with co-occurring inflammatory disease, other iron studies can be performed. </i></li><li><span class=\"concept\" data-cid=\"9926\">Total iron-binding capacity (TIBC)/transferrin <i>this will be high</span>. A high TIBC reflects low iron stores. </i>. Note that the transferrin <i>saturation</i> will however be low</li><li>Blood film <i>anisopoikilocytosis (red blood cells of different sizes and shapes) </i>, target cells, 'pencil' poikilocytes</li><li>Endoscopy <i> to rule out malignancy, males and post-menopausal females who present with unexplained iron-deficiency anaemia should be considered for further gastrointestinal investigations. Post-menopausal women with a haemoglobin level \u226410 and men with a haemoglobin level \u226411 should be referred to a gastroenterologist within 2 weeks. </i></li></ul><br />Management<br /><ul><li>The underlying cause of the iron-deficiency anaemia must be identified and managed. It is particularly important that malignancy has been excluded by taking an adequate history and appropriate investigations if warranted</li><li>Oral ferrous sulfate: patients should continue taking iron for <span class=\"concept\" data-cid=\"10835\">3 months</span> after the iron deficiency has been corrected in order to replenish iron stores. Common side effects of iron supplementation include nausea, abdominal pain, constipation, diarrhoea</li><li>Iron-rich diet: this includes dark-green leafy vegetables, meat, iron-fortified bread</li></ul>",

The following is based on the 2020 update to the NICE ACS guidelines.<br /><br />Acute coronary syndrome can be classified as follows:<br /><ul><li>ST-elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI): ST-segment elevation + elevated biomarkers of myocardial damage</li><li>non ST-elevation myocardial infarction (NSTEMI): ECG changes but no ST-segment elevation + elevated biomarkers of myocardial damage</li><li>unstable angina</li></ul><br />The management of ACS depends on the particular subtype.

Systemically, there are cardiovascular effects resulting from <span class=\"concept\" data-cid=\"5203\">fluid loss and sequestration of fluid into the third space</span>. There is a marked catabolic response. Immunosupression is common with large burns and bacterial translocation from the gut lumen is a recognised event. Sepsis is a common cause of death following major burns. <br /><br /><h5 class='notes-heading'>Management of more severe burns</h5><br />The initial aim is to stop the burning process and resuscitate the patient. <br /><br />The airway should be assessed first as with any emergency<br /><ul><li>smoke inhalation can result in airway oedema</li><li><span class=\"concept\" data-cid=\"11640\">early intubation</span> should be considered e.g. if deep burns to the face or neck, blisters or oedema of the oropharynx, stridor etc</li></ul><br />Intravenous fluids will be required for children with burns greater than 10% of total body surface area. Adults with burns greater than 15% of total body surface area will also require IV fluids. The fluids are calculated using the <span class=\"concept\" data-cid=\"1550\">Parkland formula</span> which is; volume of fluid= total body surface area of the burn % x weight (Kg) x4. Half of the fluid is administered in the first 8 hours.  <br /><br />A urinary catheter should be inserted. Analgesia should be given. Complex burns, burns involving the hand perineum and face and burns >10% in adults and >5% in children should be transferred to a burns unit. <br /><br />Circumferential burns affecting a limb or severe torso burns impeding respiration may require escharotomy to divide the burnt tissue. <br /><br />Conservative management is appropriate for superficial burns and mixed superficial burns that will heal in 2 weeks. More complex burns may require excision and skin grafting. Excision and primary closure is not generally practised as there is a high risk of infection. <br /><br />There is no evidence to support the use of anti microbial prophylaxis or topical antibiotics in burn patients. <br /><br />Escharotomies<br /><ul><li>Indicated in circumferential full thickness burns to the torso or limbs.</li><li>Careful division of the encasing band of burn tissue will potentially improve ventilation (if the burn involves the torso), or relieve compartment syndrome and oedema (where a limb is involved)</li></ul>",

            "The correct answer is <b>Standard release isosorbide mononitrate</b>. This is because standard release nitrates, such as isosorbide mononitrate, are well known to cause nitrate tolerance. Nitrate tolerance develops when there is a diminished response to nitrates following their continuous use. The mechanism behind this phenomenon isn't fully understood but it's thought to be due to depletion of endogenous thiols or an increase in oxidative stress. To avoid this, a nitrate-free interval of 10-12 hours per day is often recommended.<br /><br /><b>Nifedipine</b> does not lead to the development of tolerance. It belongs to the calcium channel blocker class of anti-anginal medications and works by inhibiting the inflow of calcium ions into vascular smooth muscle cells, leading to relaxation and vasodilation. Tolerance to this class of drugs has not been reported in clinical practice.<br /><br />Similarly, <b>Nicorandil</b>, a potassium channel activator with nitrate-like properties, does not typically result in tolerance. Its dual mechanism of action - causing venous and arterial vasodilation via its nitrate moiety and its potassium channel activation - provides effective angina relief without the risk of developing tolerance.<br /><br /><b>Verapamil</b>, another type of calcium channel blocker (but acting more on the myocardium than on the vascular smooth muscle), also doesn't lead to tolerance. It reduces myocardial oxygen demand by decreasing heart rate and contractility which helps control angina symptoms.<br /><br />Finally, <b>Modified release isosorbide mononitrate</b> has been specifically designed to overcome the problem of nitrate tolerance seen with standard release preparations. By providing a slow and sustained release of medication over 24 hours with a built-in nitrate-free period, it avoids continuous exposure to nitrates thereby minimising the risk of developing tolerance.<br />",

            "The correct answer is MRI with contrast. This patient has a likely diagnosis of multiple sclerosis (MS) as she is presenting with evidence of optic neuritis (painful eye movements and visual disturbance) and urinary incontinence, with an intervening period of remission. This clinical history, along with her age and gender make a diagnosis of MS likely. MS is an autoimmune demyelinating disorder that affects the central nervous system (CNS). As lesions can affect any part of the CNS, symptoms can be varied, but optic neuritis is often associated with the condition. The best imaging modality to view demyelinating lesions in MS is MRI with contrast. This will often show high signal T2 lesions and periventricular plaques. <br /><br />CT without contrast is incorrect; while this may identify demyelinating lesions, it does not provide the necessary detail with which to make a definitive diagnosis. <br /><br />CT with contrast is incorrect as this does not provide sufficient detail to view demyelinating lesions. <br /><br />MRI without contrast is incorrect as this does not provide sufficient detail to view demyelinating lesions; it may however be used in disease monitoring.<br /><br />Positron emission tomography is incorrect; this is used to demonstrate how metabolically active cells are and would provide little to aid a diagnosis, while also giving a high radiation dose to the patient.",

It has also been noted that transjugular intrahepatic portosystemic shunting (TIPSS) may precipitate encephalopathy.<br /><br />Features<br /><ul><li>confusion, altered GCS (see below)</li><li>asterixis: 'liver flap', arrhythmic negative myoclonus with a frequency of 3-5 Hz</li><li>constructional apraxia: inability to draw a 5-pointed star</li><li>triphasic slow waves on EEG</li><li>raised ammonia level (supportive but not diagnostic - levels do not correlate well with severity)</li></ul><br />Grading of hepatic encephalopathy<br /><ul><li>Grade I: Irritability</li><li>Grade II: Confusion, inappropriate behaviour</li><li>Grade III: Incoherent, restless</li><li>Grade IV: Coma</li></ul><br />Precipitating factors<br /><ul><li>infection e.g. spontaneous bacterial peritonitis</li><li>GI bleed</li><li><span class=\"concept\" data-cid=\"1076\">post transjugular intrahepatic portosystemic shunt</span></li><li>constipation</li><li>drugs: sedatives, diuretics</li><li>hypokalaemia</li><li>renal failure</li><li>increased dietary protein (uncommon)</li></ul><br />Management<br /><ul><li>treat any underlying precipitating cause</li><li>NICE recommend <span class=\"concept\" data-cid=\"1075\">lactulose first-line, with the addition of rifaximin</span> for the secondary prophylaxis of hepatic encephalopathy</li><li>lactulose is thought to work by promoting the excretion of ammonia and increasing the metabolism of ammonia by gut bacteria</li><li>antibiotics such as rifaximin are thought to modulate the gut flora resulting in decreased ammonia production</li><li>other options include embolisation of portosystemic shunts and liver transplantation in selected patients</li></ul>",
