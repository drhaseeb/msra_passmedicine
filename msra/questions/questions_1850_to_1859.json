            "<b>Stop methotrexate and wait 6 months before trying to conceive</b> is the correct advice. Methotrexate is a folate antagonist and is highly teratogenic, carrying a significant risk of miscarriage and major congenital abnormalities, including neural tube defects, craniofacial abnormalities, and limb defects. Due to its mechanism of action and persistence in tissues, it must be completely cleared from the body before conception is attempted. UK guidelines, supported by the British Society for Rheumatology (BSR), recommend that women stop methotrexate for at least 6 months prior to attempting conception. This washout period ensures that the drug levels are negligible, minimising the risk to the fetus during the critical period of organogenesis, which occurs in the first trimester, often before a pregnancy is confirmed. During this 6-month period, the patient's disease activity must be closely monitored. As she is stopping a key disease-modifying anti-rheumatic drug (DMARD), there is a risk of a disease flare. Her treatment should be optimised with pregnancy-compatible medications, such as hydroxychloroquine (which she is already on and should continue) and potentially sulfasalazine, to maintain disease control. Low-dose corticosteroids can also be used if necessary. This proactive management is crucial for both maternal and fetal health, as active inflammatory disease during pregnancy is associated with adverse outcomes.<br /><br /><b>Stop methotrexate and try to conceive immediately</b> is incorrect. While stopping methotrexate is the first essential step, attempting to conceive immediately is unsafe. The drug has a prolonged elimination phase from deep tissue compartments, and a significant washout period is required to ensure it is fully cleared. Conceiving while the drug is still present in the system exposes the embryo to the same teratogenic risks as taking the medication actively. The advice to wait is a critical safety measure based on the drug's pharmacokinetics. Rushing to conceive without an adequate washout period would be a serious breach of care and could lead to devastating consequences for the pregnancy. The patient must be counselled on the importance of using effective contraception during this 6-month washout period.<br /><br /><b>Continue methotrexate until a positive pregnancy test</b> is dangerous and incorrect advice. The most critical period of fetal development, organogenesis, occurs between 3 and 8 weeks of gestation. A pregnancy test may not become positive until 4-5 weeks of gestation, by which time significant fetal development has already occurred under the influence of the teratogenic drug. Exposure to methotrexate during this window can lead to a pattern of anomalies known as methotrexate embryopathy. Therefore, the drug must be stopped well in advance of any planned conception. This advice would be appropriate for some medications that are considered lower risk, but for a potent teratogen like methotrexate, pre-conception cessation is mandatory.<br /><br /><b>Stop hydroxychloroquine and continue methotrexate</b> is incorrect and reverses the appropriate advice. Hydroxychloroquine is considered safe to use throughout pregnancy and breastfeeding. It is often recommended that women with rheumatic diseases continue taking it during pregnancy to maintain disease control and reduce the risk of flares, which can themselves be harmful to the pregnancy. Conversely, methotrexate is a known teratogen and must be stopped. This option demonstrates a fundamental misunderstanding of the safety profiles of these two commonly used DMARDs in the context of pregnancy planning. Following this advice would involve stopping a safe and beneficial medication while continuing a highly dangerous one.<br /><br /><b>Stop methotrexate and switch to leflunomide</b> is incorrect. Leflunomide is another DMARD that is also highly teratogenic and is strictly contraindicated in women planning a pregnancy. It has an extremely long half-life, and its active metabolite can be detected in the plasma for up to two years after discontinuation. For women who have taken leflunomide and wish to conceive, an accelerated drug elimination procedure using cholestyramine or activated charcoal is mandatory, followed by verification that plasma levels are below the safe threshold. Switching from one potent teratogen (methotrexate) to another (leflunomide) is not a valid strategy for managing RA in a patient planning a family. The management should instead focus on switching to pregnancy-compatible DMARDs like sulfasalazine and hydroxychloroquine.",

Patients tend to have a flare following delivery</li><li>methotrexate<ul><li>women: not safe in pregnancy and needs to be stopped at least 6 months before conception</li><li>men: no proven risk from low-dose use; some specialists advise no washout, others suggest 3 months. See <i>Medicines in pregnancy</i> link for details</li></ul></li><li>leflunomide is not safe in pregnancy</li><li>sulfasalazine and hydroxychloroquine are considered safe in pregnancy</li><li>interestingly studies looking at pregnancy outcomes in patients treated with TNF-&alpha; blockers do not show any significant increase in adverse outcomes. It should be noted however that many of the patients included in the study stopped taking TNF-&alpha; blockers when they found out they were pregnant</li><li>low-dose corticosteroids may be used in pregnancy to control symptoms</li><li>NSAIDs may be used until 32 weeks but after this time should be withdrawn due to the risk of early close of the ductus arteriosus</li><li>patients should be referred to an obstetric anaesthetist due to the risk of atlanto-axial subluxation</li></ul>",

            "<b> Episcleritis</b> is the correct answer. The image shows segmented areas of redness and dilated episcleral vessels. Episcleritis is a self-limiting non-infective inflammation of the episclera, a layer situated underneath the conjunctiva. It presents with a painless segmented, rather than diffuse, eye redness. The vessels of the episclera are inflamed and dilated as seen in the image. The key to distinguishing the causes of a painless red eye, is the actual appearance. While episcleritis looks like a segmented area is red, subconjunctival haemorrhage will look diffusely red and conjunctivitis will have other features like discharge and itchiness. The management of these patients is conservative as the redness should resolve in a few weeks.<br /><br /><b>Acute angle closure glaucoma</b> is incorrect. This is one of the options that would present with a painful red eye. The acute angle closure prevents the aqueous humour to exit the anterior chamber, causing raised intraocular pressure. This would be an extremely painful red eye, with blurred vision and reduced visual acuity, which is not the case here.<br /><br /><b>Conjunctivitis</b> is incorrect. This would present with a painless red itchy eye with discharge. Depending on the cause, there would be clear discharge in viral conjunctivitis and more purulent discharge in bacterial conjunctivitis. As with episcleritis, visual acuity should not be affected.<br /><br /><b> Scleritis</b> is incorrect. This is more serious than episcleritis, as it has complications including necrotising scleritis. It has a similar presentation to episcleritis, but it presents with a usually painful red eye and diffuse redness. Photophobia and reduced visual acuity can also be seen.<br /><br /><b>Subconjunctival haemorrhage</b> is incorrect. This happens when one of the vessels in the conjunctiva ruptures and bleeds into the subconjunctival space (between sclera and conjunctiva). This presents as a painless red eye that does not affect vision. Unlike, in this case, the redness should be more unanimous rather than small vessels being evident.

Furthermore, abrupt discontinuation after prolonged use can lead to a flare-up of symptoms.<br /><br />Moving on to the other options:<br /><br /><b>Camouflage creams</b> can be beneficial in managing acne rosacea.

Patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD), especially those on haemodialysis, have a significantly higher risk of cardiovascular diseases. Among them, ischaemic heart disease represents the leading cause of death. This is due to several factors including hypertension, dyslipidaemia, anaemia and systemic inflammation that are common in CKD patients.<br /><br /><b>Hyperkalaemia</b> is a common complication in patients on haemodialysis but it rarely leads to death directly. It can be life-threatening if not properly managed as it can cause cardiac arrhythmias. However, routine dialysis and careful monitoring of potassium levels usually prevent fatal outcomes.<br /><br /><b>Malignancy</b> is not the most likely cause of death in these patients although they do have an increased risk for certain types of cancer such as renal cell carcinoma and urothelial carcinoma. This increased risk might be related to impaired immune function and chronic inflammation associated with CKD.<br /><br /><b>Dilated cardiomyopathy</b> can occur in CKD patients due to uraemic cardiomyopathy or anaemia-induced high output state, but it's less common than ischemic heart disease. Moreover, its progression could be slowed down by optimal management of fluid overload and anaemia which are often present in these patients.<br /><br />Finally, <b> dialysis-related sepsis</b> represents a significant cause of morbidity but not necessarily mortality in haemodialysis patients.

Keratoacanthomas (KAs) are rapidly growing skin tumours that can be difficult to distinguish clinically from squamous cell carcinomas (SCCs).

Given this diagnostic uncertainty and the potential for malignancy, UK guidelines recommend urgent referral (2-week wait pathway) for suspected skin cancer. The lesion's characteristics (rapid growth over 3 months, crater formation) are concerning features that warrant prompt specialist assessment.<br /><br /><b>Reassure will spontaneously involute within 3 months</b> is incorrect because although KAs can spontaneously resolve, it is impossible to definitively distinguish them from SCCs without histological examination. Adopting a watch-and-wait approach could delay the diagnosis and treatment of a potential malignancy.<br /><br /><b>Topical 5-FU</b> is incorrect because while 5-fluorouracil can be used for certain pre-malignant skin conditions like actinic keratoses, it is not appropriate for suspected KAs or SCCs.

            "<b>Age-related macular degeneration</b> is the correct diagnosis. This patient's presentation is classic for ARMD, which is the leading cause of irreversible vision loss in this age group in the UK. The key features are the advanced age, the gradual onset over months, and the specific nature of the visual disturbance. The macula is responsible for central, high-acuity vision, so its degeneration leads to symptoms like difficulty reading and recognising faces, as described. The preservation of peripheral vision is a hallmark feature that helps distinguish it from conditions like advanced glaucoma. Furthermore, the presence of metamorphopsia (straight lines appearing wavy or distorted) is highly specific for macular pathology. This occurs as the degenerating photoreceptors in the macula become displaced. ARMD is classified into 'dry' (atrophic) and 'wet' (neovascular) forms. Dry ARMD is more common and progresses slowly, whereas wet ARMD involves abnormal blood vessel growth and can cause rapid, severe vision loss. The patient's symptoms warrant urgent referral to an ophthalmologist for assessment, typically with optical coherence tomography (OCT), to confirm the diagnosis and determine the type and severity.<br /><br /><b>Cataracts</b> are a common cause of gradual visual decline in the elderly but are a less likely diagnosis here. Cataracts involve the opacification of the lens, which typically causes a generalised, uniform blurring of vision, often described as looking through a frosted or misty window. Patients also commonly report issues with glare, especially when driving at night, and may notice colours appearing faded. While cataracts can make reading difficult, they do not typically cause the specific central scotoma or the metamorphopsia described by the patient. The combination of central visual loss with distorted lines points away from the lens and towards a retinal, specifically macular, problem.<br /><br /><b>Primary open-angle glaucoma</b> is an important differential for insidious visual loss in older adults. However, it characteristically affects the peripheral visual fields first, leading to a gradual constriction of vision, often described as 'tunnel vision' in its advanced stages. Central visual acuity is typically preserved until very late in the disease process. This patient's symptoms are the opposite of the classic glaucomatous pattern, as she explicitly states her peripheral vision is intact while her central vision is failing. Therefore, glaucoma is a much less likely cause of her specific complaints.<br /><br /><b>Diabetic retinopathy</b> is a significant cause of blindness but is a complication of diabetes mellitus. There is no mention of the patient having diabetes in the clinical scenario. While diabetic maculopathy can cause central visual loss and distortion similar to ARMD, the absence of a known diabetes diagnosis makes ARMD a far more probable cause in an 82-year-old. In the absence of this key risk factor, diabetic retinopathy should be considered lower on the list of differentials. An ophthalmologist would be able to distinguish the fundoscopic findings of drusen (in ARMD) from microaneurysms, haemorrhages, and exudates (in diabetic retinopathy).<br /><br /><b>Central retinal vein occlusion</b> is an incorrect choice because it typically presents with a more acute or subacute, painless, monocular loss of vision, rather than the six-month gradual history described here. A CRVO is a vascular event, akin to a 'stroke in the eye', and the onset is usually measured in hours to days. While vision can be severely affected, the chronicity of this patient's symptoms makes a degenerative process like ARMD much more likely than a vascular occlusion. Fundoscopy in CRVO would reveal marked retinal haemorrhages, macular oedema, and dilated, tortuous veins, which would likely be visible even on direct ophthalmoscopy.",
