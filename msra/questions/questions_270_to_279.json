        "title": "Subdural haemorrhage",
        "body": "A subdural haematoma is a collection of blood deep to the dural layer of the meninges. The blood is not within the substance of the brain and is therefore called an 'extra-axial' or 'extrinsic' lesion. They can be unilateral or bilateral.<br /><br />Subdural haematomas can be classified in terms of their age:<br /><ul><li><b>Acute</b>: Symptoms usually develop within 48 hours of injury, characterised by rapid neurological deterioration</li><li><b>Subacute</b>: Symptoms manifest within days to weeks post-injury, with a more gradual progression.</li><li><b>Chronic</b>: Common in the elderly, developing over weeks to months. Patients may not recall a specific head injury.</li></ul><br />The typical presentation of a subdural haematoma (SDH) often involves a history of head trauma, which may range from minor to severe. Patients frequently exhibit a lucid interval followed by a gradual decline in consciousness. This pattern is particularly common in chronic SDH. Other hallmark features include headache, confusion, and lethargy.<br /><br /><h5 class='notes-heading'>Clinical Features</h5><br />Neurological Symptoms:<br /><ul><li>Altered Mental Status: Ranging from mild confusion to deep coma. <span class=\"concept\" data-cid=\"619\">Fluctuations in the level of consciousness are common.</span></li><li>Focal Neurological Deficits: Weakness on one side of the body, aphasia, or visual field defects, depending on the haematoma's location.</li><li>Headache: Often localised to one side, worsening over time.</li><li>Seizures: May occur, particularly in acute or expanding hematomas.</li></ul><br />Physical Examination Findings:<br /><ul><li>Papilloedema: Indicates raised intracranial pressure.</li><li>Pupil Changes: Unilateral dilated pupil, especially on the side of the haematoma, indicating compression of the third cranial nerve.</li><li>Gait Abnormalities: Including ataxia or weakness in one leg.</li><li>Hemiparesis or Hemiplegia: Reflecting the mass effect and midline shift.</li></ul><br />Behavioural and Cognitive Changes:<br /><ul><li>Memory Loss: Especially in chronic SDH.</li><li>Personality Changes: Irritability, apathy, or depression.</li><li>Cognitive Impairment: Difficulty with attention, problem-solving, and other executive functions.</li></ul><br />Other Associated Features:<br /><ul><li>Nausea and Vomiting: Secondary to increased intracranial pressure.</li><li>Drowsiness: Progressing to stupor and coma in severe cases.</li><li>Signs of Increased Intracranial Pressure: Such as bradycardia, hypertension, and respiratory irregularities (Cushing's triad).</li></ul><br />Although the collection of blood is within the same anatomical compartment, acute and chronic subdurals have important differences in terms of their mechanisms, associated clinical features and management:<br /><br /><h5 class='notes-heading'>Acute subdural haematoma</h5><br />An acute subdural haematoma is a collection of fresh blood within the subdural space and is most commonly caused by high-impact trauma. Since it is associated with high-impact injuries, there is often other brain underlying brain injuries.<br /><br />There is a spectrum of severity of symptoms and presentation depending on the size of the compressive acute subdural haematoma and the associated injuries. Presentation ranges from an incidental finding in trauma to severe coma and coning due to herniation.<br /><br />CT imaging is the first-line investigation and will show a crescentic collection, not limited by suture lines. They will appear hyperdense (bright) in comparison to the brain. Large acute subdural haematomas will push on the brain ('mass effect') and cause midline shift or herniation.<br /><br />Small or incidental acute subdurals can be observed conservatively. Surgical options include monitoring of intracranial pressure and decompressive craniectomy.<br /><br /><br /><h5 class='notes-heading'>Chronic subdural haematoma</h5><br />A chronic subdural haematoma is a collection of blood within the subdural space that has been present for weeks to months. <br /><br />Rupture of the small bridging veins within the subdural space rupture and cause slow bleeding. Elderly and alcoholic patients are particularly at risk of subdural haematomas since they have brain atrophy and therefore fragile or taut bridging veins. <br /><br />Presentation is typically a several week to month progressive history of either confusion, reduced consciousness or neurological deficit.<br /><br />Infants also have fragile bridging veins and can rupture in shaken baby syndrome.<br /><br />On CT imaging they similarly are crescentic in shape, not restricted by suture lines and compress the brain ('mass effect'). In contrast to acute subdurals, chronic subdurals are <span class=\"concept\" data-cid=\"5102\">hypodense (dark)</span> compared to the substance of the brain.<br /><br /><div class=\"container\"><div class=\"row\"><div class=\"col-md-3\"><a href=\"https://d32xxyeh8kfs8k.cloudfront.net/images_Passmedicine/xrb946b.jpg\" data-fancybox=\"gallery\" data-caption=\"CT (non-contrast) showing subdural haematoma in an elderly woman.

Although this patient has facial swelling, there are no signs of shock or respiratory distress on examination. Treating this patient with adrenaline would not harm the patient but would not have a therapeutic effect in treating her minimal change disease.<br /><br /><b>Albumin infusion</b> is incorrect. This colloid fluid may be used in patients with tissue oedema and low oncotic pressure to draw the fluid out of the tissues and back into circulation. This patient does have hypoalbuminemia and the albumin infusion may be used as adjunctive therapy for this patient; however, its therapeutic effect will only be temporary.<br /><br /><b>Furosemide</b> is incorrect. This is a loop diuretic which may be used in the treatment of fluid overload. Furosemide may be used as adjunctive therapy for this patient; however, its therapeutic effect will only be temporary.<br /><br /><b>Ramipril</b> is incorrect. This is an ACE inhibitor commonly used in the treatment of hypertension. It is also used to treat certain glomerulonephritides (such as IgA nephropathy associated with hypertension). ACE inhibitors do not have a role in managing acute nephrotic syndrome, and there is no evidence of hypertension in the vignette.",

The inability to oppose the thumb (loss of opponens pollicis function), weakness of index and middle finger flexion (due to loss of flexor digitorum superficialis and the radial half of flexor digitorum profundus), and the specific pattern of sensory loss over the palmar surface of the lateral 3\u00bd digits are pathognomonic features of median nerve damage. The location of injury in the forearm from a circular saw makes this anatomically consistent, as the median nerve travels between the two heads of pronator teres and continues deep to flexor digitorum superficialis in this region. This level of injury would affect both the motor branches to the forearm flexors and the continuation to the hand muscles.<br /><br /><b>Ulnar nerve</b> injury would present differently with weakness of the small muscles of the hand (interossei and medial two lumbricals), causing clawing of the ring and little fingers. Sensory loss would affect the medial 1\u00bd digits on both palmar and dorsal surfaces. The patient would have difficulty with finger abduction and adduction, and Froment's sign would be positive. Thumb opposition would be preserved as this is primarily a median nerve function.<br /><br /><b>Radial nerve</b> injury at the forearm level would cause weakness of wrist and finger extension, leading to wrist drop. There would be no loss of thumb opposition or finger flexion as described in this case. Sensory loss would be limited to a small area over the first web space on the dorsum of the hand. The clinical picture described is inconsistent with radial nerve pathology.<br /><br /><b>Anterior interosseous nerve</b> is a pure motor branch of the median nerve that arises just below the elbow.

            "<b>Pirfenidone</b> is the correct answer. This patient has a confirmed diagnosis of idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) with a forced vital capacity (FVC) of 75% of predicted. UK NICE guidelines recommend the use of antifibrotic agents, such as pirfenidone or nintedanib, for patients with IPF who have an FVC between 50% and 80% of predicted. Pirfenidone is an oral medication with antifibrotic and anti-inflammatory properties. While its exact mechanism is not fully understood, it is thought to downregulate the production of growth factors and procollagens. Clinical trials have demonstrated that it significantly slows the rate of decline in lung function (as measured by FVC) and may improve progression-free survival. Therefore, initiating this treatment is the most appropriate step to modify the course of this progressive disease.<br /><br /><b>Azathioprine</b> is an immunosuppressive agent. It is used in the management of some forms of interstitial lung disease (ILD), particularly those associated with connective tissue diseases like systemic sclerosis or rheumatoid arthritis. However, its use in IPF is not recommended. The PANTHER-IPF trial, which studied a combination of prednisone, azathioprine, and N-acetylcysteine for IPF, was stopped early due to increased rates of death and hospitalisation in the treatment group compared to placebo. This highlights that immunosuppression is not beneficial and may be harmful in IPF, which is considered a primarily fibrotic, rather than inflammatory, process.<br /><br /><b>N-acetylcysteine</b> is an antioxidant that was previously thought to be a potential treatment for IPF. An earlier trial (IFIGENIA) suggested a possible benefit. However, the subsequent, more definitive PANTHER-IPF trial found no benefit of N-acetylcysteine monotherapy over placebo in slowing the decline of lung function in patients with IPF. As a result, it is no longer recommended in international guidelines for the treatment of IPF. Its inclusion as an option tests for up-to-date knowledge regarding IPF management.<br /><br /><b>Prednisolone</b>, a corticosteroid, is a mainstay of treatment for many inflammatory conditions, including several types of interstitial lung disease such as non-specific interstitial pneumonia (NSIP) or cryptogenic organising pneumonia. However, IPF is characterised by progressive fibrosis with minimal inflammation. Large-scale clinical trials have not shown a benefit for corticosteroid monotherapy in IPF, and long-term use is associated with significant side effects. Current guidelines strongly recommend against the use of prednisolone as a standalone treatment for IPF.<br /><br /><b>Sildenafil</b> is a phosphodiesterase-5 inhibitor that acts as a pulmonary vasodilator. It is used to treat pulmonary hypertension. While pulmonary hypertension is a common and serious complication of advanced IPF, sildenafil does not treat the underlying fibrotic lung disease itself. Its use is reserved for patients who have confirmed pulmonary hypertension on right heart catheterisation. It does not slow the decline in FVC and is therefore not the primary treatment for the underlying fibrotic process in this patient.",

            "<b>Acute mesenteric ischaemia</b> is the correct diagnosis. This condition should be strongly suspected in any patient with a significant embolic risk factor, such as atrial fibrillation, who presents with sudden-onset, severe abdominal pain. The classic description is 'pain out of proportion to clinical signs', which is demonstrated in this scenario by the patient being in severe distress despite having a soft abdomen with only mild tenderness. The underlying pathophysiology is typically an embolus, often from the left atrium in atrial fibrillation, lodging in the superior mesenteric artery, leading to acute bowel ischaemia. The raised white cell count and significant lactic acidosis are key biochemical markers of tissue hypoperfusion and infarction. Early diagnosis, typically with a CT angiogram, is critical as mortality is extremely high without urgent surgical intervention to restore blood flow and resect non-viable bowel.<br /><br /><b>Perforated peptic ulcer</b> is a plausible differential as it can cause sudden, severe abdominal pain. However, the clinical findings are typically very different. A perforated viscus releases gastric contents into the peritoneal cavity, causing a chemical peritonitis. This classically results in a rigid, 'board-like' abdomen with guarding and rebound tenderness on examination. This patient's abdomen is described as soft with only mild tenderness, which makes significant peritonitis, and therefore a perforated peptic ulcer, much less likely. While a leukocytosis would be expected, the degree of pain with minimal signs is the key feature pointing away from this diagnosis.<br /><br /><b>Acute pancreatitis</b> can present with severe central or epigastric abdominal pain, often radiating to the back. It can also be associated with a raised white cell count and, in severe cases, a lactic acidosis due to systemic inflammation and hypovolemia. However, the pain is not typically described as being 'out of proportion' to the signs; significant epigastric tenderness is usually present. Furthermore, atrial fibrillation is not a specific risk factor for pancreatitis, whereas it is a major risk factor for mesenteric ischaemia. A diagnosis of pancreatitis would require a significantly elevated serum amylase or lipase (typically >3 times the upper limit of normal), which is the cornerstone of diagnosis.<br /><br /><b>Ruptured abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA)</b> is a critical differential for an elderly patient with sudden abdominal pain. The pain can be severe and central, often radiating to the back or groin. However, a ruptured AAA is a catastrophic event leading to massive haemorrhage. The patient would typically be haemodynamically unstable, with profound hypotension and tachycardia, and may have a pulsatile, expansile abdominal mass on examination. This patient's observations are described as stable, making a contained leak possible but a full rupture highly unlikely. The presentation does not fit the typical picture of a ruptured AAA.<br /><br /><b>Ischaemic colitis</b> is another form of bowel ischaemia but has a different pathophysiology and clinical presentation. It is more often due to a low-flow state rather than an acute embolic occlusion, and it affects the large bowel, particularly at 'watershed' areas like the splenic flexure. The pain is typically less severe than in acute mesenteric ischaemia, often described as crampy and localised to the left side of the abdomen. It is also more commonly associated with diarrhoea and rectal bleeding. The sudden, catastrophic nature of the pain in this scenario, coupled with the history of atrial fibrillation, points strongly towards an embolic event affecting the small bowel (acute mesenteric ischaemia) rather than the more insidious, low-flow state of ischaemic colitis.",

In healthy individuals, this is met by an upregulation of endogenous cortisol production via the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis.<br /><br />However, patients on long-term corticosteroid therapy may have suppression of the HPA axis and are therefore unable to mount an adequate endogenous stress response. Consequently, these patients are at risk of adrenal insufficiency and may require supplemental steroids during times of physiological stress.<br /><br />Peri-operative considerations for patients on long-term corticosteroids:<br /><ul><li><span class=\"concept\" data-cid=\"5822\">Convert to IV hydrocortisone</span>: For moderate to major surgical procedures, oral steroids should be temporarily withheld and replaced with IV hydrocortisone 50\u2013100 mg at induction of anaesthesia, followed by 6-hourly dosing or a continuous infusion.</li><li>Fludrocortisone supplementation: If there is associated hypotension or if the patient is on long-term corticosteroids that do not have significant mineralocorticoid activity (e.g. dexamethasone), consider adding fludrocortisone.</li><li>Post-operative steroid replacement:<ul><li>For minor procedures: Usual oral corticosteroids may be resumed immediately post-operatively if the patient is clinically stable and tolerating oral intake.</li><li>For major surgery: Continue IV hydrocortisone (e.g. 50 mg every 6 hours or equivalent continuous infusion) for up to 72 hours post-operatively, with transition back to oral steroids as the patient recovers.</li></ul></li><li>Ensure appropriate tapering of steroids after the period of stress has resolved, returning to the patient\u2019s maintenance dose.</li></ul><br /><h5 class='notes-heading'>ACE inhibitors and angiotensin-II receptor antagonists</h5><br />ACE inhibitors and angiotensin-II receptor antagonists can be associated with severe hypotension after induction of anaesthesia; these drugs should be discontinued <span class=\"concept\" data-cid=\"12378\">24 hours before surgery</span>. <br /><br /><h5 class='notes-heading'>Emergency cases</h5><br />Stabilise and resuscitate where needed.<br /><br />Consider whether antibiotics are needed and when and how they should be administered.<br />Inform blood bank if major procedures planned particularly where coagulopathies are present at the outset or anticipated (e.g. Ruptured AAA repair)<br />Don't forget to consent and inform relatives.<br /><br /><br /><h5 class='notes-heading'>Special preparation</h5><br />Some procedures require special preparation:<br /><ul><li>Thyroid surgery; vocal cord check.</li><li>Parathyroid surgery; consider methylene blue to identify gland.</li><li>Sentinel node biopsy; radioactive marker/ patent blue dye.</li><li>Surgery involving the thoracic duct; consider administration of cream.</li><li>Pheochromocytoma surgery; will need alpha and beta blockade.</li><li>Surgery for carcinoid tumours; will need covering with octreotide.</li><li>Colorectal cases; bowel preparation (especially left sided surgery)</li><li>Thyrotoxicosis; lugols iodine/ medical therapy.</li></ul>",
