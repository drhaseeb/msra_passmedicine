            "The correct answer is <b>Irritant contact dermatitis</b>. This is the most likely diagnosis given the patient's new occupation as a cleaner, which involves frequent exposure to irritant chemicals and water. The presentation of a generalised erythematous rash on the dorsum of both hands without scaling or vesicles is typical of irritant contact dermatitis. The acute onset coinciding with new occupational exposure to irritants strongly supports this diagnosis. Cleaners are at high risk due to repeated exposure to cleaning agents, detergents, and wet work.<br /><br /><b>Tinea manuum</b> is incorrect because fungal infections typically present with scaling and a well-defined border. The absence of scaling in this case makes tinea manuum unlikely. Additionally, tinea manuum, caused by dermatophytes such as <i>Trichophyton rubrum</i>, often presents asymmetrically and may involve the palmar surfaces.<br /><br /><b>Allergic contact dermatitis</b> is incorrect because while it can present similarly, it typically develops after sensitisation to a specific allergen over time (type IV hypersensitivity reaction). The acute onset with new occupation suggests an irritant rather than allergic mechanism. Allergic contact dermatitis often presents with more intense pruritus and may show vesiculation.<br /><br /><b>Ichthyosis vulgaris</b> is incorrect as this is an inherited condition characterised by persistent scaling and dryness of the skin. It typically presents in early childhood and affects large areas of the body, not just the hands. The absence of scaling and the acute onset make this diagnosis unlikely.<br /><br /><b>Pustular psoriasis</b> is incorrect because this condition presents with sterile pustules on an erythematous base, often with associated scaling. The absence of pustules and scaling, along with the clear temporal relationship to occupational exposure, makes this diagnosis unlikely. Pustular psoriasis is also typically more severe and may be associated with systemic symptoms.",

        "body": "NICE published updated guidelines for the management of hypertension in 2019. This builds on the significant guidelines released in 2011 that recommended:<br /><ul><li>classifying hypertension into stages</li><li>recommending the use of <span class=\"concept\" data-cid=\"547\">ambulatory blood pressure monitoring (ABPM)</span> and home blood pressure monitoring (HBPM)</li></ul><br /><br /><CENTER><table><tr><td align = 'left' colspan='2'><a data-fancybox class='fancybox' rel='group' href='https://d32xxyeh8kfs8k.cloudfront.net/images_Passmedicine/pdd927b.png'><img class='ajaximage' src='https://d32xxyeh8kfs8k.cloudfront.net/images_Passmedicine/pdd927.png'/></a></td></tr><tr><td valign='top' align='left'></td><td align='right'><a data-fancybox class='fancybox lbmagglasslink' rel='group' href='https://d32xxyeh8kfs8k.cloudfront.net/images_Passmedicine/pdd927b.png'><img src='https://d32xxyeh8kfs8k.cloudfront.net/css/images/mag_glass.png'/></a></td></tr></table></CENTER><div class='imagetext'>Flow chart showing simplified schematic for diagnosis hypertension following NICE guidelines</div><br /><br /><h5 class='notes-heading'>Why were these guidelines needed?</h5><br />It has long been recognised by doctors that there is a subgroup of patients whose blood pressure climbs 20 mmHg whenever they enter a clinical setting, so called 'white coat hypertension'. If we just rely on clinic readings then such patients may be diagnosed as having hypertension when, the vast majority of the time, their blood pressure is normal.<br /><br />This has led to the use of both ambulatory blood pressure monitoring (ABPM) and home blood pressure monitoring (HBPM) to confirm the diagnosis of hypertension. These techniques allow a more accurate assessment of a patients' overall blood pressure. Not only does this help prevent overdiagnosis of hypertension - ABPM has been shown to be a more accurate predictor of cardiovascular events than clinic readings.<br /><br /><h5 class='notes-heading'>Blood pressure classification</h5><br />This becomes relevant later in some of the management decisions that NICE advocate.<br /><br /><div class=\"table-responsive\"><table class = \"tlarge table table-striped table-bordered\"  data-role=\"table\" id=\"tableid1\" ><thead><tr><th><b>Stage</b></th><th><b>Criteria</b></th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td><b>Stage 1 hypertension</b></td><td>Clinic BP >= 140/90 mmHg and subsequent ABPM daytime average or HBPM average BP >= 135/85 mmHg</td></tr><tr><td><b>Stage 2 hypertension</b></td><td>Clinic BP >= 160/100 mmHg and subsequent ABPM daytime average or HBPM average BP >= 150/95 mmHg</td></tr><tr><td><b>Severe hypertension</b></td><td>Clinic systolic BP >= 180 mmHg, or clinic diastolic BP >= 120 mmHg</td></tr></tbody></table></div><br /><h5 class='notes-heading'>Diagnosing hypertension</h5><br />Firstly, NICE recommend measuring blood pressure in both arms when considering a diagnosis of hypertension. <br /><br />If the difference in readings between arms is more than 20 mmHg then the measurements should be repeated. If the difference remains > 20 mmHg then subsequent blood pressures should be recorded from the arm with the higher reading.<br /><br />It should of course be remember that there are pathological causes of unequal blood pressure readings from the arms, such as supravalvular aortic stenosis. It is therefore prudent to listen to the heart sounds if a difference exists and further investigation if a very large difference is noted.<br /><br />NICE also recommend taking a second reading during the consultation, if the first reading is > 140/90 mmHg. The lower reading of the two should determine further management.<br /><br />NICE suggest offering ABPM or HBPM to any patient with a blood pressure >= 140/90 mmHg.<br /><br />If the blood pressure is >= 180/120 mmHg:<br /><ul><li>admit for specialist assessment if:<ul><li><span class=\"concept\" data-cid=\"10965\">signs of retinal haemorrhage or papilloedema (accelerated hypertension)</span> or</li><li>life-threatening symptoms such as <span class=\"concept\" data-cid=\"10966\">new-onset confusion, chest pain, signs of heart failure, or acute kidney injury</span></li></ul></li><li>NICE also recommend referral if a phaeochromocytoma is suspected (labile or postural hypotension, headache, palpitations, pallor and diaphoresis)</li><li>if none of the above then arrange <span class=\"concept\" data-cid=\"10967\">urgent investigations for end-organ damage</span> (e.g. bloods, urine ACR, ECG)<ul><li>if target organ damage is identified, consider starting antihypertensive drug treatment immediately, without waiting for the results of ABPM or HBPM.</li><li>if no target organ damage is identified, repeat clinic blood pressure measurement within 7 days</li></ul></li></ul><br />Ambulatory blood pressure monitoring (ABPM)<br /><ul><li>at least 2 measurements per hour during the person's usual waking hours (for example, between 08:00 and 22:00)</li><li>use the average value of at least 14 measurements</li></ul><br />If ABPM is not tolerated or declined HBPM should be offered.<br /><br />Home blood pressure monitoring (HBPM)<br /><ul><li>for each BP recording, two consecutive measurements need to be taken, at least 1 minute apart and with the person seated</li><li>BP should be recorded twice daily, ideally in the morning and evening</li><li>BP should be recorded for at least 4 days, ideally for 7 days</li><li>discard the measurements taken on the first day and use the average value of all the remaining measurements</li></ul><br /><h5 class='notes-heading'>Interpreting the results</h5><br />ABPM/HBPM >= 135/85 mmHg (i.e. stage 1 hypertension)<br /><ul><li>treat if < 80 years of age AND any of the following apply; target organ damage, established cardiovascular disease, renal disease, diabetes or a 10-year cardiovascular risk equivalent to 10% or greater</li><li>in 2019, NICE made a further recommendation, suggesting that we should <i>'consider antihypertensive drug treatment in addition to lifestyle advice for adults aged under 60 with stage 1 hypertension and an estimated 10-year risk below 10%.

            "<b>Silicosis</b> is the correct answer. Silicosis is an example of a pneumoconiosis, a class of lung disease characterised by inhalation of (usually occupational) dust. Silicosis classically presents in miners/pottery workers with prolonged exposure to aerosolised dust particles, usually over decades. Patients may report progressive exertional dyspnoea and dry cough due to chronic inflammatory changes. Radiographic features include upper zone fibrosis and 'egg-shell' calcification of the hilar nodes, so-called due to the peripheral calcific changes.<br /><br />Overall, conditions involving inhalation of toxic substances generally display upper-lobe predominance due to variable ventilation/perfusion ratios in different parts of the lungs. In upright individuals, the upper lobes are ventilated more than they are perfused (V/Q >1). Conversely, the lower lobes are more perfused than they are ventilated (V/Q >1). As such conditions caused by inhalation of noxious substances tend to disproportionately affect the upper lobes of the lungs.<br /><br /><b>Asbestosis</b> is incorrect. Although, like silicosis, asbestosis is a pneumoconiosis, occupations at risk are classically firefighters, dockyard workers, and construction workers rather than miners. Furthermore, asbestosis exposure may be radiologically apparent via pleural plaques and lower lobe fibrosis rather than hilar node calcification and upper lobe fibrosis.<br /><br /><b>Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis</b> is incorrect. Although IPF may present with progressive exertional dyspnoea, this classically does not show radiographically exhibit upper lobe predominance. Furthermore, this patient's mining occupation and egg-shell hilar node calcification are more suggestive of silicosis.

            "The correct answer is <b>Herpes simplex</b>. This is because the patient's symptoms, including flu-like symptoms followed by painful genital lesions and dysuria (pain on passing urine), are characteristic of a primary outbreak of genital herpes caused by the <i>Herpes simplex</i> virus. The initial infection can often be accompanied by systemic symptoms such as fever, malaise, and myalgia, which may precede the appearance of painful vesicular eruptions in the genital area.<br /><br /><b>Genital warts</b>, caused by certain strains of the <i>Human papillomavirus (HPV)</i>, typically present as painless growths on the genitals rather than painful vesicular eruptions. They are usually not associated with systemic symptoms like fever or malaise.<br /><br /><b>Molluscum contagiosum</b>, caused by a poxvirus, presents with small, firm, dome-shaped papules with a central dimple. These lesions are generally not painful and do not cause systemic symptoms. <br /><br /><b>Herpes zoster</b>, also known as shingles, is caused by the reactivation of latent varicella-zoster virus (the same virus that causes chickenpox). It typically presents as a unilateral rash along a dermatome and would be an unusual cause for genital lesions unless it involves sacral dermatomes which is less common. Furthermore, Herpes zoster does not commonly present with systemic flu-like symptoms or dysuria.<br /><br />Finally, while <b>Urinary tract infection (UTI)</b> can indeed cause dysuria and systemic illness symptoms such as fever and malaise, it would not typically result in an eruption of spots around the vaginal area.

Three days ago he reports he was independent and walking normally. He has a past medical history of type 2 diabetes mellitus for which he takes insulin.<br /><br />On examination he has a heart rate of 121 beats per minute, a blood pressure of 101/72 mmHg and a temperature of 38.3\u00baC. He has 4/5 power throughout the right leg. Sensation is altered over the right anterior thigh and knee. The left leg has 4/5 power in hip flexion and extension, 3/5 power in knee flexion, knee extension and ankle dorsiflexion and there is 0/5 power in great toe extension and plantarflexion. Sensation is altered on the left over the thigh and knee but absent to both light touch and pin prick in the left foot.<br /><br />What is the most likely diagnosis?",

            "The patient here is clearly showing signs of sepsis with an evolving lower limb neurological deficit. The most likely explanation would be an epidural abscess causing compression of the cauda equina. Apart from the clinical signs he also has a history of diabetes which is a known risk factor for developing an epidural abscess.<br /><br />A diabetic foot can present with a neurological deficit and sepsis but the neurological distribution is peripheral and distal to proximal. A left-sided diabetic gangrene would not cause right-sided neurological symptoms such as sensory loss and paraesthesia, especially not in the proximal limb.<br /><br />Discitis with a pathological fracture can also cause a similar presentation of sepsis with neurological deficit but the key factor is the absence of pain. Fractures, especially pathological fractures with instability, are painful and the lack of back pain makes this far less likely than an epidural abscess.<br /><br />Intracranial pathology is unlikely given the focal neurological deficit confined to the lower limbs. Both an intracranial abscess and meningitis are likely to cause systemic neurological symptoms such as meningism, depressed consciousness and weakness affecting upper and lower limbs. As these features are all absent it makes an intracranial pathology very unlikely.",
