Adding these scores together (3+4+4) gives a total GCS of 11.<br /><br /><b>GCS 10 (M4 V4 E2)</b> is incorrect. This option incorrectly scores the eye opening component as 2 (to pain), whereas the patient opens his eyes to speech, which scores 3 points.<br /><br /><b>GCS 11 (M5 V3 E3)</b> is incorrect. This option incorrectly scores the motor response as 5 (localises to pain) and the verbal response as 3 (inappropriate words). The patient withdraws from pain (M4) and is confused (V4).<br /><br /><b>GCS 12 (M5 V4 E3)</b> is incorrect.

Breaking down the patient's neurological status: Eye opening (E) - the patient opens his eyes when his name is called, which corresponds to 'eye opening to speech' and scores 3 points. Verbal response (V) - the patient is confused about the date and time, which corresponds to 'confused conversation' and scores 4 points. Motor response (M) - the patient withdraws his limbs when pressure is applied to his nail beds, which corresponds to 'withdraws from pain' and scores 4 points. Adding these scores together (3+4+4) gives a total GCS of 11.<br /><br /><b>GCS 10 (M4 V4 E2)</b> is incorrect. This option incorrectly scores the eye opening component as 2 (to pain), whereas the patient opens his eyes to speech, which scores 3 points.<br /><br /><b>GCS 11 (M5 V3 E3)</b> is incorrect. This option incorrectly scores the motor response as 5 (localises to pain) and the verbal response as 3 (inappropriate words). The patient withdraws from pain (M4) and is confused (V4).<br /><br /><b>GCS 12 (M5 V4 E3)</b> is incorrect. This option incorrectly scores the motor response as 5 (localises to pain), whereas the patient withdraws from pain, which scores 4 points.<br /><br /><b>GCS 13 (M6 V4 E3)</b> is incorrect. This option incorrectly scores the motor response as 6 (obeys commands). The patient withdraws from pain, which scores 4 points. A score of 6 would require the patient to follow specific commands, which is not demonstrated in this scenario.",

The patient has no neurological deficit on examination, her CT brain is normal, and no EEG has been performed yet to demonstrate unequivocal epileptic activity. It's important to note that after a first seizure, the DVLA regulations in the UK would require her to stop driving for at least 6 months regardless of whether medication is started.

While lamotrigine is a first-line treatment for generalised tonic-clonic seizures, starting anti-epileptic medication after a single seizure without meeting any of the exceptional criteria is not recommended. Lamotrigine requires slow titration over several weeks to reduce the risk of serious skin reactions, making it less suitable for immediate initiation in the emergency setting.<br /><br /><b>Commence levetiracetam and refer to the neurology clinic</b> is also not appropriate. Although levetiracetam is another first-line treatment for generalised tonic-clonic seizures and has the advantage of a simpler titration schedule than lamotrigine, the decision to start any anti-epileptic medication after a first seizure should generally be made by a specialist unless specific criteria are met.<br /><br /><b>Request an urgent EEG and commence anti-epileptic medication if abnormal</b> is a reasonable approach in principle, as unequivocal epileptic activity on EEG is one criterion that might justify starting treatment after a first seizure.

While structural abnormalities on brain imaging can justify starting treatment after a first seizure, the patient has already had a normal CT brain.

            "The correct answer is erythema multiforme. This patient is presenting with some non-itchy target lesions on her neck. The name of target lesions comes from the fact they have three concentric colour zones, a darker centre with a blister, a ring around this that is paler pink and raised due to oedema and a bright red outermost ring. This shape of lesion is characteristic of erythema multiforme, a hypersensitivity reaction that is most commonly triggered by infections. In this case, the patient complains of a cold sore on her upper lip (herpes labials) that most likely triggered the reaction. <br /><br />Atopic dermatitis (or eczema) is a common presentation, especially in children. It presents with pruritic, erythematous, and scaly skin lesions often localized to the flexural surfaces of the body. But this patient presents with target lesions and normal surrounding skin on the neck rather than flexor surfaces making the diagnosis unlikely.  <br /><br />Bullous pemphigoid is an autoimmune condition causing sub-epidermal blistering of the skin. It is common in elderly patients and is usually itchy. Given that this patient has no blisters and itchiness the diagnosis is unlikely. <br /><br />Erythema nodosum is an inflammation of subcutaneous fat that typically causes tender, erythematous, nodular lesions. It typically occurs on the shins. It can be caused by an infection or a systemic disease such as sarcoidosis. Even if she has one of the diseases which constitute a risk factor for the development of the conditions, the symptoms and presentation of this patient are not in keeping with this diagnosis. <br /><br />Stevens-Johnson syndrome is a severe systemic reaction affecting the skin and mucosa, almost always caused by a drug reaction. The characteristic rash is typically maculopapular with target lesions. This patient has this type of lesion, however, this patient is systematically well, whilst in Stevens-Johnson syndrome, fever and arthralgia extremely are common.

In healthy individuals, this is met by an upregulation of endogenous cortisol production via the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis.<br /><br />However, patients on long-term corticosteroid therapy may have suppression of the HPA axis and are therefore unable to mount an adequate endogenous stress response. Consequently, these patients are at risk of adrenal insufficiency and may require supplemental steroids during times of physiological stress.<br /><br />Peri-operative considerations for patients on long-term corticosteroids:<br /><ul><li><span class=\"concept\" data-cid=\"5822\">Convert to IV hydrocortisone</span>: For moderate to major surgical procedures, oral steroids should be temporarily withheld and replaced with IV hydrocortisone 50\u2013100 mg at induction of anaesthesia, followed by 6-hourly dosing or a continuous infusion.</li><li>Fludrocortisone supplementation: If there is associated hypotension or if the patient is on long-term corticosteroids that do not have significant mineralocorticoid activity (e.g. dexamethasone), consider adding fludrocortisone.</li><li>Post-operative steroid replacement:<ul><li>For minor procedures: Usual oral corticosteroids may be resumed immediately post-operatively if the patient is clinically stable and tolerating oral intake.</li><li>For major surgery: Continue IV hydrocortisone (e.g. 50 mg every 6 hours or equivalent continuous infusion) for up to 72 hours post-operatively, with transition back to oral steroids as the patient recovers.</li></ul></li><li>Ensure appropriate tapering of steroids after the period of stress has resolved, returning to the patient\u2019s maintenance dose.</li></ul><br /><h5 class='notes-heading'>ACE inhibitors and angiotensin-II receptor antagonists</h5><br />ACE inhibitors and angiotensin-II receptor antagonists can be associated with severe hypotension after induction of anaesthesia; these drugs should be discontinued <span class=\"concept\" data-cid=\"12378\">24 hours before surgery</span>. <br /><br /><h5 class='notes-heading'>Emergency cases</h5><br />Stabilise and resuscitate where needed.<br /><br />Consider whether antibiotics are needed and when and how they should be administered.<br />Inform blood bank if major procedures planned particularly where coagulopathies are present at the outset or anticipated (e.g. Ruptured AAA repair)<br />Don't forget to consent and inform relatives.<br /><br /><br /><h5 class='notes-heading'>Special preparation</h5><br />Some procedures require special preparation:<br /><ul><li>Thyroid surgery; vocal cord check.</li><li>Parathyroid surgery; consider methylene blue to identify gland.</li><li>Sentinel node biopsy; radioactive marker/ patent blue dye.</li><li>Surgery involving the thoracic duct; consider administration of cream.</li><li>Pheochromocytoma surgery; will need alpha and beta blockade.</li><li>Surgery for carcinoid tumours; will need covering with octreotide.</li><li>Colorectal cases; bowel preparation (especially left sided surgery)</li><li>Thyrotoxicosis; lugols iodine/ medical therapy.</li></ul>",

            "The patient should be reviewed after <b>1 week</b>. All patients who start a selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI) are initially at an increased risk of suicidal ideation, however, this side effect is most prevalent in younger patients. For this reason, patients under 25, or patients who are at an increased risk of suicide, should be reviewed after 1 week.<br /><br /><b>1 month</b> is an incorrect answer because this patient's age means that he is at higher risk of suicidal ideation and attempting suicide after starting an SSRI.

            "Aspergilloma is the correct answer. An aspergilloma is a fungal mass that is found in pre-formed body cavities. It is generally secondary to tuberculosis. Other cavitary diseases predisposing to aspergilloma include sarcoidosis, bronchiectasis, and ankylosing spondylitis. This patient has a past history of tuberculosis which is a significant risk factor, as well as the use of immunosuppressive medications like corticosteroids. Mild haemoptysis may occur in some patients which suggests the lesion has eroded into a neighbouring blood vessel. The air crescent sign on chest x-ray is a characteristic finding of aspergilloma where a crescent of air that surrounds a radiopaque mass present in a lung cavity is visible.<br /><br />Bronchiectasis is not the correct answer here. In addition to the haemoptysis, we would expect other features such as a significant history of a cough with productive sputum. On examination, we would hear widespread crackles. It would also not explain the x-ray findings. <br /><br />Histiocytosis is also incorrect. Whilst it is also a cause of upper lobe fibrosis like aspergilloma, it is a disease that is more frequent in children under 15 years of age.  It is also a condition that causes clonal proliferation of pathogenic langerhan cells that leads to inflammation and tissue destruction around the body. This leads to systemic symptoms such as bone pain, skin rash, and polyuria. <br /><br />Reactivation of tuberculosis is not the correct option. We would expect some systemic symptoms with reactivation of tuberculosis such as weight loss, anorexia, or night sweats. Tuberculosis would also not explain the x-ray findings. We would expect fibro-nodular opacities in the upper lobes in TB. <br /><br />Sarcoidosis is also not correct. Whilst sarcoidosis can predispose to aspergilloma, it is not what this patient is suffering from. We would expect more systemic symptoms with sarcoidosis such as arthralgia and lymphadenopathy. It would also not explain the x-ray findings in this patient. We would expect bilateral hilar lymphadenopathy if the patient has sarcoidosis.",
