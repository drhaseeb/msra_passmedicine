            "<b>Administer tetanus vaccine booster and human tetanus immunoglobulin</b> is the correct answer. The UK Health Security Agency (UKHSA) 'Green Book' provides clear guidance on tetanus prophylaxis. This patient has a wound that must be classified as 'tetanus-prone'. This is due to the mechanism (a puncture injury from a rusty nail acquired in a contaminated environment like a garden) and the presence of devitalised tissue. The patient's vaccination history is uncertain. In cases of uncertain or incomplete vaccination history with a tetanus-prone wound, guidelines recommend both active immunisation with a tetanus-containing vaccine and passive immunisation with Human Tetanus Immunoglobulin (HTIG). The vaccine booster stimulates the patient's own long-term immunity, while the HTIG provides immediate passive protection against tetanus toxin, which is crucial given the nature of the wound. This dual approach provides the most comprehensive and immediate protection.<br /><br /><b>Administer tetanus vaccine booster only</b> would be insufficient in this scenario. While a vaccine booster is required, it is not the complete management. This option is appropriate for a patient with an uncertain vaccination history who has sustained a 'clean' wound (i.e., not tetanus-prone). It would also be the correct management for a patient with a *complete* vaccination history whose last dose was over 10 years ago and who has sustained a tetanus-prone wound. However, because this patient's history is unknown and the wound is tetanus-prone, passive immunisation with HTIG is also mandated to provide immediate cover while active immunity develops.<br /><br /><b>Arrange urgent wound debridement only</b> is an important part of management but does not address the specific question of immunoprophylaxis. Thorough cleaning and, if necessary, surgical debridement of a wound are critical to remove foreign material and necrotic tissue, which reduces the anaerobic environment where *Clostridium tetani* can proliferate. However, this is an adjunct to, not a replacement for, appropriate immunisation. The question specifically asks for the most appropriate management regarding tetanus prophylaxis, making this option incomplete.<br /><br /><b>Contact the patient's GP to confirm vaccination status</b> is a plausible but incorrect immediate step. While confirming vaccination status is ideal, it should not delay necessary treatment. It can be difficult or impossible to obtain this information promptly, especially out of hours. The UKHSA guidance is clear that if there is any doubt about a patient's vaccination history, they should be managed as if they are unimmunised or their immunisations are not up-to-date. Delaying prophylaxis for a high-risk wound while awaiting confirmation from a GP is not best practice and could place the patient at unnecessary risk.<br /><br /><b>No tetanus prophylaxis required</b> is incorrect. This course of action is only safe for individuals who have a documented, complete course of tetanus immunisations (i.e., 5 doses in the UK) with the most recent dose administered within the last 10 years. Given that this patient has an uncertain vaccination history and has sustained a tetanus-prone wound, withholding prophylaxis would be clinically inappropriate and dangerous.",

            "The correct answer is <b>Renal artery stenosis</b>. This patient has experienced a significant acute kidney injury (AKI), with a >30% fall in eGFR, shortly after the initiation of an ACE inhibitor (ramipril). This clinical picture is highly suggestive of underlying bilateral renal artery stenosis, or unilateral stenosis in a patient with a single functioning kidney. In patients with significant renal artery stenosis, renal perfusion pressure is reduced. To maintain the glomerular filtration rate (GFR), the kidney relies on angiotensin II-mediated constriction of the efferent arteriole. ACE inhibitors block the production of angiotensin II, leading to efferent arteriole dilatation. This causes a precipitous drop in intraglomerular pressure and consequently a sharp fall in GFR, manifesting as a rapid rise in serum creatinine. The patient's age and history of type 2 diabetes and hypertension are major risk factors for atherosclerosis, which is the most common cause of renal artery stenosis.<br /><br /><b>Acute interstitial nephritis</b> (AIN) is a cause of AKI, often secondary to a hypersensitivity reaction to drugs (e.g., NSAIDs, antibiotics, proton pump inhibitors). While ACE inhibitors are a very rare cause, the classic presentation of AIN often includes systemic features such as fever, rash, and eosinophilia, none of which are described in this asymptomatic patient. The timing is less specific than the classic haemodynamic effect seen in renal artery stenosis.<br /><br /><b>Diabetic nephropathy</b> is a very likely long-term condition in this patient given his history. However, it is a chronic, progressive disease characterised by a gradual decline in renal function over many years. It would not cause such an acute and significant deterioration in eGFR over a two-week period immediately following a medication change. In fact, ACE inhibitors are a first-line treatment to slow the progression of diabetic nephropathy.<br /><br /><b>Hypertensive nephrosclerosis</b>, similar to diabetic nephropathy, is a chronic process of kidney damage resulting from long-standing hypertension. It leads to a slow, insidious decline in renal function. It does not explain the acute drop in GFR seen in this scenario. The acute event is clearly linked to the introduction of the ACE inhibitor, pointing towards a haemodynamic rather than a chronic structural cause.<br /><br /><b>Cholesterol emboli syndrome</b> can cause an AKI but typically occurs after an event that dislodges atherosclerotic plaque, such as angiography, vascular surgery, or thrombolysis. The presentation is often subacute and accompanied by other systemic signs of embolisation, such as livedo reticularis, purple toes ('blue toe syndrome'), or eosinophilia. There is no such precipitating event or associated clinical features in this case.",

This clinical picture is highly suggestive of underlying bilateral renal artery stenosis, or unilateral stenosis in a patient with a single functioning kidney. In patients with significant renal artery stenosis, renal perfusion pressure is reduced. To maintain the glomerular filtration rate (GFR), the kidney relies on angiotensin II-mediated constriction of the efferent arteriole. ACE inhibitors block the production of angiotensin II, leading to efferent arteriole dilatation. This causes a precipitous drop in intraglomerular pressure and consequently a sharp fall in GFR, manifesting as a rapid rise in serum creatinine. The patient's age and history of type 2 diabetes and hypertension are major risk factors for atherosclerosis, which is the most common cause of renal artery stenosis.<br /><br /><b>Acute interstitial nephritis</b> (AIN) is a cause of AKI, often secondary to a hypersensitivity reaction to drugs (e.g., NSAIDs, antibiotics, proton pump inhibitors). While ACE inhibitors are a very rare cause, the classic presentation of AIN often includes systemic features such as fever, rash, and eosinophilia, none of which are described in this asymptomatic patient. The timing is less specific than the classic haemodynamic effect seen in renal artery stenosis.<br /><br /><b>Diabetic nephropathy</b> is a very likely long-term condition in this patient given his history. However, it is a chronic, progressive disease characterised by a gradual decline in renal function over many years. It would not cause such an acute and significant deterioration in eGFR over a two-week period immediately following a medication change. In fact, ACE inhibitors are a first-line treatment to slow the progression of diabetic nephropathy.<br /><br /><b>Hypertensive nephrosclerosis</b>, similar to diabetic nephropathy, is a chronic process of kidney damage resulting from long-standing hypertension. It leads to a slow, insidious decline in renal function. It does not explain the acute drop in GFR seen in this scenario. The acute event is clearly linked to the introduction of the ACE inhibitor, pointing towards a haemodynamic rather than a chronic structural cause.<br /><br /><b>Cholesterol emboli syndrome</b> can cause an AKI but typically occurs after an event that dislodges atherosclerotic plaque, such as angiography, vascular surgery, or thrombolysis. The presentation is often subacute and accompanied by other systemic signs of embolisation, such as livedo reticularis, purple toes ('blue toe syndrome'), or eosinophilia. There is no such precipitating event or associated clinical features in this case.",

            "<b>6 months</b> is the correct answer. This patient has an unprovoked pulmonary embolism (PE) as there are no identifiable risk factors mentioned in the clinical scenario. According to the 2020 NICE guidelines on venous thromboembolism (VTE) management, unprovoked PEs should typically be treated with anticoagulation for a total of 6 months. The guidelines recommend that all patients with VTE should receive at least 3 months of anticoagulation, with extension to 6 months for unprovoked events in patients with a low bleeding risk. Since this patient has no significant past medical history and takes no regular medications, she is likely to have a low bleeding risk, making 6 months of anticoagulation the most appropriate option. The decision to continue anticoagulation beyond the initial 3 months should be based on balancing the risk of VTE recurrence against the risk of bleeding, but for unprovoked events with low bleeding risk, the benefits of continuing to 6 months typically outweigh the risks.<br /><br /><b>3 months</b> would be appropriate for a provoked PE where there was a clear temporary risk factor such as recent surgery, immobilisation, or pregnancy. In this case, the PE is unprovoked, meaning there is a higher risk of recurrence, and therefore a longer duration of anticoagulation is warranted. The NICE guidelines specifically state that for unprovoked VTE with low bleeding risk, anticoagulation should typically be extended beyond the initial 3 months to a total of 6 months.<br /><br /><b>12 months</b> of anticoagulation would be excessive for an initial unprovoked PE without additional risk factors. While some patients with recurrent unprovoked VTEs or persistent risk factors may require longer anticoagulation, the standard recommendation for a first unprovoked PE is 6 months. Extending treatment to 12 months without specific indications would unnecessarily increase the bleeding risk without providing significant additional benefit in most cases.<br /><br /><b>Lifelong</b> anticoagulation is not routinely recommended for a first unprovoked PE. Lifelong anticoagulation might be considered for patients with recurrent unprovoked VTEs, certain thrombophilias (such as antiphospholipid syndrome), or active cancer. However, for this patient with a first unprovoked PE and no other risk factors, lifelong anticoagulation would expose her to unnecessary bleeding risks without clear evidence of benefit.<br /><br /><b>3 months with consideration for extension based on D-dimer testing</b> is not currently recommended as standard practice in the UK according to NICE guidelines. While some research has explored using D-dimer levels to guide decisions about extending anticoagulation, this approach has not been incorporated into the main UK guidelines. The current recommendation is to base the decision to extend treatment on clinical factors such as whether the event was provoked or unprovoked and the patient's bleeding risk, rather than D-dimer testing.",
