            "<b>Thrombectomy</b> is correct. This patient has had an ischaemic stroke given the symptoms of left-sided paralysis and paraesthesia in association with vascular risk factors and confirmatory CT imaging. NICE guidelines recommend that the first-line treatment of choice is thrombolysis (provided that there are no contraindications). However, this must be delivered within 4.5 hours. This patient's symptoms have lasted for 6 hours. For this reason, this patient would not be appropriate to receive thrombolysis. However, NICE guidelines recommend that a thrombectomy can be provided within 6 hours of an acute anterior ischaemic stroke. This is still within the time limits since this patient's onset of symptoms.<br /><br /><b>Aspirin</b> is incorrect. Although aspirin may be given in the initial presentation of symptoms, this question is asking for the most definitive treatment. Since this patient has presented to the hospital within the timeframe for thrombectomy, this is the preferred treatment as it is much more likely to restore normal function compared to daily aspirin.<br /><br /><b>Clopidogrel</b> is incorrect. Although clopidogrel is used in the secondary prevention of stroke, it is not the most definitive treatment compared to thrombectomy.<br /><br /><b>Thrombolysis</b> is incorrect.

It requires a dedicated team to determine eligibility, ensure timely delivery and provide hyperacute stroke services to patients afterwards.<br /><br />The standard criteria for thrombolysis with alteplase or tenecteplase are as follows: <br /><ul><li>it is administered within <span class=\"concept\" data-cid=\"214\">4.5 hours of onset</span> of stroke symptoms</li><li><span class=\"concept\" data-cid=\"214\">haemorrhage has been definitively excluded</span> (i.e. Imaging has been performed)</li></ul><br />The 2023 National Clinical Guideline for Stroke broadened the potential inclusion criteria. <br /><ul><li>it recommends that patients with an <span class=\"concept\" data-cid=\"12221\">acute ischaemic stroke, regardless of age or stroke severity, who were last known to be well more than 4.5 hours earlier, should be considered for thrombolysis with alteplase if</span>:<ul><li>treatment can be started between 4.5 and 9 hours of known onset, or within 9 hours of the midpoint of sleep when they have woken with symptoms, AND</li><li>they have evidence from CT/MR perfusion (core-perfusion mismatch) or MRI (DWI-FLAIR mismatch) of the potential to salvage brain tissue</li></ul></li><li>this should be irrespective of whether they have a large artery occlusion and require mechanical thrombectomy.</li><li>there are specific criteria in the guidelines that determine the imagine criteria that determine whether thrombolysis should be performed</li></ul><br /><span class=\"concept\" data-cid=\"2669\">Blood pressure should be lowered to 185/110 mmHg before thrombolysis</span>.<br /><br /><h6 class='notes-subheading'>Contraindications to thrombolysis</h6><br /><div class=\"table-responsive\"><table class = \"tlarge table table-striped table-bordered\"  data-role=\"table\" id=\"tableid1\" ><thead><tr><th>Absolute</th><th>\tRelative</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>- Previous intracranial haemorrhage<br />- Seizure at onset of stroke<br />- Intracranial neoplasm<br />- Suspected subarachnoid haemorrhage<br />- Stroke or traumatic brain injury in preceding 3 months<br />- Lumbar puncture in preceding 7 days<br />- Gastrointestinal haemorrhage in preceding 3 weeks<br />- Active bleeding<br />- Oesophageal varices<br />- Uncontrolled hypertension >200/120mmHg\t</td><td>- Pregnancy<br />- Concurrent anticoagulation (INR >1.7)<br />- Haemorrhagic diathesis<br />- Active diabetic haemorrhagic retinopathy<br />- Suspected intracardiac thrombus<br />- Major surgery / trauma in the preceding 2 weeks</td></tr></tbody></table></div><br /><br /><h5 class='notes-heading'>Thrombectomy for acute ischaemic stroke</h5><br />Mechanical thrombectomy is an exciting new treatment option for patients with an acute ischaemic stroke.

NICE recommend that all decisions about thrombectomy take into account a patient's overall clinical status:<br /><ul><li>NICE recommend a pre-stroke functional status of less than 3 on the modified Rankin scale and a score of more than 5 on the National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale (NIHSS)</li></ul><br />Offer thrombectomy as soon as possible and within <span class=\"concept\" data-cid=\"9594\">6 hours of symptom onset</span>, together <span class=\"concept\" data-cid=\"9596\">with intravenous thrombolysis (if within 4.5 hours)</span>, to people who have:<br />acute ischaemic stroke and<br /><ul><li>confirmed occlusion of the <b>proximal anterior circulation</b> demonstrated by computed tomographic angiography (CTA) or magnetic resonance angiography (MRA) </li></ul><br />Offer thrombectomy as soon as possible to people who were last known to be well between <span class=\"concept\" data-cid=\"9595\">6 hours and 24 hours previously (including wake-up strokes)</span>:<br /><ul><li>confirmed occlusion of the <b>proximal anterior circulation</b> demonstrated by CTA or MRA and</li><li>if there is the <span class=\"concept\" data-cid=\"9595\">potential to salvage brain tissue, as shown by imaging such as CT perfusion or diffusion-weighted MRI sequences showing limited infarct core volume</span></li></ul><br /><i>Consider</i> thrombectomy together with intravenous thrombolysis (if within 4.5 hours) as soon as possible for people last known to be well up to 24 hours previously (including wake-up strokes):<br /><ul><li>who have acute ischaemic stroke and confirmed occlusion of the <b>proximal posterior circulation (that is, basilar or posterior cerebral artery)</b> demonstrated by CTA or MRA and</li><li>if there is the potential to salvage brain tissue, as shown by imaging such as CT perfusion or diffusion-weighted MRI sequences showing limited infarct core volume</li></ul><br /><br /><h5 class='notes-heading'>Secondary prevention</h5><br />Recommendations from NICE include:<br /><ul><li><span class=\"concept\" data-cid=\"10231\">clopidogrel is now recommended</span> by NICE ahead of combination use of aspirin plus modified-release (MR) dipyridamole in people who have had an ischaemic stroke</li><li><span class=\"concept\" data-cid=\"10232\">aspirin is recommended after an ischaemic stroke only if clopidogrel is contraindicated or not tolerated</span></li></ul><br /><span class=\"concept\" data-cid=\"4059\">Carotid endarterectomy</span> is recommend if the patient has suffered a stroke or TIA in the carotid territory and is not severely disabled<br /><ul><li>should only be considered if the stenosis > 50% according to North American Symptomatic Carotid Endarterectomy Trial (NASCET) criteria</li></ul>  - it should be noted that previous guidelines have used other reporting methods, that have resulted in different cut-offs, e.g. European Carotid Surgery Trial (ECST) with a cut-off of 70%<br /><ul><li>it should be performed as soon as possible within 7 days</li></ul>",

        "body": "It is normal for people to feel sadness and grief following the death of a loved one and this does not necessarily need to be medicalised. However, having some understanding of the potential stages a person may go through whilst grieving can help determine whether a patient is having a 'normal' grief reaction or is developing a more significant problem.<br /><br />One of the most popular models of grief divides it into 5 stages. <br /><ul><li>Denial: this may include a feeling of numbness and also pseudohallucinations of the deceased, both auditory and visual. Occasionally people may focus on physical objects that remind them of their loved one or even prepare meals for them</li><li>Anger: this is commonly directed against other family members and medical professionals</li><li>Bargaining </li><li>Depression </li><li>Acceptance</li></ul><br />It should be noted that many patients will not go through all 5 stages.<br /><br />Abnormal, or atypical, grief reactions are more likely to occur in women and if the death is sudden and unexpected. Other risk factors include a problematic relationship before death or if the patient has not much social support.<br /><br />Features of atypical grief reactions include:<br /><ul><li>delayed grief: sometimes said to occur when more than 2 weeks passes before grieving begins</li><li>prolonged grief: difficult to define. Normal grief reactions may take up to and beyond 12 months</li></ul>",

            "The correct answer is <b>Transposition of the great arteries</b>. This condition is a type of cyanotic congenital heart disease, which means it's present at birth and causes low levels of oxygen in the blood, leading to a blue or purple tint to the skin (cyanosis). In transposition of the great arteries, the two main arteries leaving the heart are reversed (transposed), causing oxygen-poor blood to be circulated around the body. This results in cyanosis soon after birth.<br /><br />The first incorrect option is an <b>Atrial septal defect</b>. This is a hole in the wall between the two upper chambers of your heart (atria). The condition can lead to shunting of blood from the left atrium to right atrium due to higher pressure on the left side but this usually does not cause cyanosis as oxygenated blood from the left side mixes with deoxygenated blood on the right side resulting in slightly less oxygenated blood but not enough to cause cyanosis. <br /><br />Secondly, <b>Ventricular septal defect</b> refers to a hole in the wall separating the lower chambers of the heart (ventricles). Similar to atrial septal defect, ventricular septal defect also results in shunting of blood from the left ventricle to the right ventricle but does not cause cyanosis as it leads to increased pulmonary circulation and over time can lead to Eisenmenger syndrome where there might be reversal of shunt leading to cyanosis but that's a late complication and not immediate.<br /><br /><b>Coarctation of the aorta</b> is another incorrect option. It's a narrowing that occurs in part of the aorta, which carries oxygen-rich blood from your heart out into your body. Coarctation itself doesn't directly result in cyanosis; instead, it can lead to hypertension and complications related with it.<br /><br />Lastly, <b>Patent ductus arteriosus</b> refers to an abnormal persistence after birth of an open lumen in the ductus arteriosus, a small vessel connecting the pulmonary artery and descending thoracic aorta during fetal life for bypassing lungs. In normal circumstances this closes soon after birth and if remains patent leads again like ASD/VSD leads to left-to-right shunt increasing pulmonary circulation but not causing cyanosis unless there is reversal due to late complications similar to Eisenmenger syndrome mentioned above.",

This results in cyanosis soon after birth.<br /><br />The first incorrect option is an <b>Atrial septal defect</b>. This is a hole in the wall between the two upper chambers of your heart (atria). The condition can lead to shunting of blood from the left atrium to right atrium due to higher pressure on the left side but this usually does not cause cyanosis as oxygenated blood from the left side mixes with deoxygenated blood on the right side resulting in slightly less oxygenated blood but not enough to cause cyanosis. <br /><br />Secondly, <b>Ventricular septal defect</b> refers to a hole in the wall separating the lower chambers of the heart (ventricles). Similar to atrial septal defect, ventricular septal defect also results in shunting of blood from the left ventricle to the right ventricle but does not cause cyanosis as it leads to increased pulmonary circulation and over time can lead to Eisenmenger syndrome where there might be reversal of shunt leading to cyanosis but that's a late complication and not immediate.<br /><br /><b>Coarctation of the aorta</b> is another incorrect option. It's a narrowing that occurs in part of the aorta, which carries oxygen-rich blood from your heart out into your body. Coarctation itself doesn't directly result in cyanosis; instead, it can lead to hypertension and complications related with it.<br /><br />Lastly, <b>Patent ductus arteriosus</b> refers to an abnormal persistence after birth of an open lumen in the ductus arteriosus, a small vessel connecting the pulmonary artery and descending thoracic aorta during fetal life for bypassing lungs. In normal circumstances this closes soon after birth and if remains patent leads again like ASD/VSD leads to left-to-right shunt increasing pulmonary circulation but not causing cyanosis unless there is reversal due to late complications similar to Eisenmenger syndrome mentioned above.",

        "body": "Shoulder dystocia is a complication of vaginal cephalic delivery. It entails the inability to deliver the body of the fetus using gentle traction, the head having already been delivered. It usually occurs due to impaction of the anterior fetal shoulder on the maternal pubic symphysis. Shoulder dystocia is a cause of both maternal and fetal morbidity. <br /><br />Key risk factors<br /><ul><li><span class=\"concept\" data-cid=\"5827\">fetal macrosomia</span> (hence association with maternal diabetes mellitus)</li><li>high maternal body mass index</li><li>diabetes mellitus</li><li>prolonged labour</li></ul><br /><h5 class='notes-heading'>Management</h5><br />Senior help should be called as soon as shoulder dystocia is identified and <b>McRoberts' manoeuvre</b> should be performed:<br /><ul><li>this manoeuvre entails flexion and abduction of the maternal hips, bringing the mother's thighs towards her abdomen</li><li>this rotation increases the relative anterior-posterior angle of the pelvis and often facilitates a successful delivery. </li></ul><br />An episiotomy will not relieve the bony obstruction but is sometimes used to allow better access for internal manoeuvres.
