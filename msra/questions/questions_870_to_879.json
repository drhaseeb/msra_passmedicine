            "The correct answer is a false lumen of the ascending aorta. <br /><br />This patient presents with tearing, chest pain, hypertension, both of which suggest a likely diagnosis of aortic dissection. They also present with aortic regurgitation (diastolic murmur over the 2nd intercostal space, right sternal border). This is likely to be located in the ascending aorta as lesions in the descending aorta will usually present with normal heart sounds. A dissection occurs due to a tear in the tunica intima of the wall of the aorta, creating a false lumen that fills with large volumes of blood and can be easily seen on angiographic CT. <br /><br />Blurring of the posterior wall of the descending aorta is incorrect as this is a sign of a retroperitoneal, contained rupture of an aortic aneurysm. <br /><br />Ballooning of the aorta is incorrect as this describes an aortic aneurysm rather than a dissection.  <br /><br />False lumen of the descending aorta is incorrect. This describes a dissection of the descending aorta, which is unlikely given this patient is presenting with aortic regurgitation.<br /> <br />Pericardial thickening and calcification is incorrect.

        "body": "Degenerative cervical myelopathy (DCM) has a number of risk factors, which include smoking due to its effects on the intervertebral discs, genetics and occupation - those exposing patients to high axial loading [1]. <br /><br />The presentation of DCM is very variable. Early symptoms are often subtle and can vary in severity day to day, making the disease difficult to detect initially. However as a progressive condition, worsening, deteriorating or new symptoms should be a warning sign.<br /><br />DCM symptoms can include any combination of [1]: <br /><ul><li>Pain (affecting the neck, upper or lower limbs)</li><li>Loss of motor function (loss of digital dexterity, preventing simple tasks such as holding a fork or doing up their shirt buttons, arm or leg weakness/stiffness leading to impaired gait and imbalance</li><li>Loss of sensory function causing numbness</li><li>Loss of autonomic function (urinary or faecal incontinence and/or impotence) - these can occur and do not necessarily suggest cauda equina syndrome in the absence of other hallmarks of that condition</li><li>Hoffman's sign: is a reflex test to assess for cervical myelopathy. It is performed by gently flicking one finger on a patient's hand. A positive test results in reflex twitching of the other fingers on the same hand in response to the flick. </li></ul><br />The most common symptoms at presentation of DCM are unknown, but in one series 50% of patients were initially incorrectly diagnosed and sometimes treated for carpal tunnel syndrome [2].<br /><br />An MRI of the cervical spine is the gold standard test where cervical myelopathy is suspected. It may reveal disc degeneration and ligament hypertrophy, with accompanying cord signal change.<br /><br />All patients with degenerative cervical myelopathy should be urgently referred for assessment by specialist spinal services (neurosurgery or orthopaedic spinal surgery). This is due to the importance of early treatment. The timing of surgery is important, as any existing spinal cord damage can be permanent. Early treatment (within 6 months of diagnosis) offers the best chance of a full recovery but at present, most patients are presenting too late. In one study, patients averaged over 5 appointments before diagnosis, representing >2 years. <br /><br />Currently, decompressive surgery is the only effective treatment. It has been shown to prevent disease progression. Close observation is an option for mild stable disease, but anything progressive or more severe requires surgery to prevent further deterioration. Physiotherapy should only be initiated by specialist services, as manipulation can cause more spinal cord damage. <br /><br />References<br />1. Baron EM, Young WF.

            "Betamethasone is an example of a corticosteroid. Corticosteroids are applied topically to reduce inflammation in skin conditions such as eczema or psoriasis. When applied appropriately (i.e. appropriate strength and lowest possible dose for lowest possible time), topical corticosteroids are associated with few adverse effects. However, if applied for a long period to the same area or in high doses, topical corticosteroids can cause local adverse effects, including skin depigmentation (particularly in patients with darker skin), skin atrophy (thinning), and excessive hair growth. The correct answer is therefore <b> skin depigmentation</b>.<br /><br /><b>Dry skin</b> is not a typical side effect associated with topical steroid use. It is, however, associated with some other common topical preparations such as benzoyl peroxide and topical retinoids, both of which are used for acne. <br /><br />There are numerous systemic effects of corticosteroids including weight gain, hyperglycaemia, hypertension and mood changes. However, it is rare for topical corticosteroids to be absorbed in high enough qualities to cause systemic side effects. Whilst it is possible if topical corticosteroids are used in high doses for long periods, it is not common and topical corticosteroids are far more likely to cause local adverse effects.
