            "<b>Continue azathioprine</b> is the correct advice. The management of autoimmune conditions like SLE during pregnancy is a careful balance of risks. Uncontrolled maternal disease poses a significant threat to both the mother and the fetus, increasing the risk of miscarriage, pre-eclampsia, fetal growth restriction, and preterm birth. Azathioprine is considered one of the safer immunosuppressants for use during pregnancy. Large observational studies have not shown an increased risk of congenital malformations at standard therapeutic doses. The active metabolite, 6-mercaptopurine, is largely metabolised by the placental enzyme thiopurine methyltransferase (TPMT), which limits fetal exposure. Therefore, for a patient with stable disease, continuing a medication that is controlling her condition and is deemed safe is the most appropriate course of action, in line with UK guidelines from bodies such as the British Society for Rheumatology (BSR).<br /><br /><b>Stop azathioprine immediately</b> is incorrect and potentially dangerous. Abruptly stopping maintenance immunosuppression in a patient with a history of SLE creates a high risk of a disease flare. A flare during pregnancy is associated with significantly worse maternal and fetal outcomes than the risks associated with continuing azathioprine. The principle of management is to maintain disease remission throughout pregnancy, and this requires continuing effective therapy. Any decision to stop medication should be made with extreme caution and specialist input, which is not warranted in this stable patient.<br /><br /><b>Switch to methotrexate</b> is incorrect and would be a serious error. Methotrexate is a potent teratogen and is absolutely contraindicated in pregnancy. It is a folic acid antagonist that can cause a specific pattern of severe congenital abnormalities (methotrexate embryopathy), affecting the cranium, face, limbs, and central nervous system, as well as increasing the risk of spontaneous abortion. UK guidelines state that methotrexate must be stopped at least three months prior to conception in both men and women.<br /><br /><b>Switch to mycophenolate mofetil</b> is also incorrect. Like methotrexate, mycophenolate mofetil (MMF) is a powerful teratogen and is absolutely contraindicated during pregnancy. It is associated with a very high risk of first-trimester miscarriage and a distinct pattern of malformations, particularly affecting the external ear (microtia), face, and distal limbs. Effective contraception is mandatory for women of childbearing potential taking MMF, and it must be stopped at least six weeks before attempting to conceive.<br /><br /><b>Switch to prednisolone monotherapy</b> is not the most appropriate advice. While corticosteroids are used to manage SLE flares during pregnancy, and low-dose prednisolone can be used for maintenance, switching a patient who is stable on azathioprine is unnecessary. Introducing or increasing long-term steroid use carries its own risks in pregnancy, including gestational diabetes, maternal hypertension, pre-eclampsia, and premature rupture of membranes. Since azathioprine is effectively controlling her disease and is considered safe, there is no clinical indication to switch to an alternative agent with a different side-effect profile.",

Early referral is important for diagnostic confirmation and to consider disease-modifying therapy.",

It often develops idiopathically but may follow injury or diabetes. The condition progresses through freezing, frozen, and thawing phases. Early physiotherapy focusing on maintaining range of motion is recommended by NICE as first-line management, alongside adequate analgesia. Corticosteroid injection may be considered if physiotherapy alone is insufficient."

        "body": "Degenerative cervical myelopathy (DCM) has a number of risk factors, which include smoking due to its effects on the intervertebral discs, genetics and occupation - those exposing patients to high axial loading [1]. <br /><br />The presentation of DCM is very variable. Early symptoms are often subtle and can vary in severity day to day, making the disease difficult to detect initially. However as a progressive condition, worsening, deteriorating or new symptoms should be a warning sign.<br /><br />DCM symptoms can include any combination of [1]: <br /><ul><li>Pain (affecting the neck, upper or lower limbs)</li><li>Loss of motor function (loss of digital dexterity, preventing simple tasks such as holding a fork or doing up their shirt buttons, arm or leg weakness/stiffness leading to impaired gait and imbalance</li><li>Loss of sensory function causing numbness</li><li>Loss of autonomic function (urinary or faecal incontinence and/or impotence) - these can occur and do not necessarily suggest cauda equina syndrome in the absence of other hallmarks of that condition</li><li>Hoffman's sign: is a reflex test to assess for cervical myelopathy. It is performed by gently flicking one finger on a patient's hand. A positive test results in reflex twitching of the other fingers on the same hand in response to the flick. </li></ul><br />The most common symptoms at presentation of DCM are unknown, but in one series 50% of patients were initially incorrectly diagnosed and sometimes treated for carpal tunnel syndrome [2].<br /><br />An MRI of the cervical spine is the gold standard test where cervical myelopathy is suspected. It may reveal disc degeneration and ligament hypertrophy, with accompanying cord signal change.<br /><br />All patients with degenerative cervical myelopathy should be urgently referred for assessment by specialist spinal services (neurosurgery or orthopaedic spinal surgery). This is due to the importance of early treatment. The timing of surgery is important, as any existing spinal cord damage can be permanent. Early treatment (within 6 months of diagnosis) offers the best chance of a full recovery but at present, most patients are presenting too late. In one study, patients averaged over 5 appointments before diagnosis, representing >2 years. <br /><br />Currently, decompressive surgery is the only effective treatment. It has been shown to prevent disease progression. Close observation is an option for mild stable disease, but anything progressive or more severe requires surgery to prevent further deterioration. Physiotherapy should only be initiated by specialist services, as manipulation can cause more spinal cord damage. <br /><br />References<br />1. Baron EM, Young WF.

        "body": "Sepsis is defined as life-threatening organ dysfunction caused by a dysregulated host response to an infection. Sepsis is increasingly recognised as an important cause of mortality in the UK and there has been increasing efforts recently to improve the care of patients who present with sepsis. <br /><br />How sepsis is classified has changed in recent years - the Surviving Sepsis Guidelines were updated in 2017. <br /><br />The new guidelines recognise the following terms:<br /><ul><li><b>sepsis</b>: life-threatening organ dysfunction caused by a dysregulated host response to infection</li><li><b>septic shock</b>: a more severe form sepsis, technically defined as <i>'in which circulatory, cellular, and metabolic abnormalities are associated with a greater risk of mortality than with sepsis alone'</i>*</li></ul><br />The old category of severe sepsis is no longer used.<br /><br />The term 'systemic inflammatory response syndrome (SIRS)' has also fallen out of favour. Adult patients outside of ICU with suspected infection are identified as being at heightened risk of mortality if they have quickSOFA (qSOFA) score meeting  >= 2 of the following criteria: respiratory rate of 22/min or greater, altered mentation, or systolic blood pressure of 100mmHg or less <br /><br /><div class='alert alert-warning'><b>qSOFA score</b><br />Respiratory rate > 22/min<br />Altered mentation<br />Systolic blood pressure < 100 mm Hg<br /></div><br /><br />Within an ICU setting a full SOFA** score is often used. Details can be found at the bottom of the notes.<br /><br /><h5 class='notes-heading'>Management</h5><br />NICE released its own guidelines in 2016. These focussed on the risk stratification and management of patients with suspected.<br /><br />For risk stratification NICE recommend using the following criteria:<br /><br /><div class=\"table-responsive\"><table class = \"tlarge table table-striped table-bordered\"  data-role=\"table\" id=\"tableid1\" ><thead><tr><th>Red flag criteria</th><th>Amber flag criteria</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td><ul><li>Responds only to voice or pain/ unresponsive</li><li>Acute confusional state</li><li>Systolic B.P <= 90 mmHg (or drop >40 from normal)</li><li>Heart rate > 130 per minute</li><li>Respiratory rate >= 25 per minute</li><li>Needs oxygen to keep SpO2 >=92%</li><li>Non-blanching rash, mottled/ ashen/ cyanotic</li><li>Not passed urine in last 18 h/ UO < 0.5 ml/kg/hr</li><li>Lactate >=2 mmol/l</li><li>Recent chemotherapy</td><td></li><li>Relatives concerned about mental status</li><li>Acute deterioration in functional ability</li><li>Immunosuppressed</li><li>Trauma/ surgery/ procedure in last 6 weeks</li><li>Respiratory rate 21-24</li><li>Systolic B.P 91-100 mmHg</li><li>Heart rate 91-130 OR new dysrhythmia</li><li>Not passed urine in last 12-18 hours</li><li>Temperature < 36\u00baC</li><li>Clinical signs of wound, device or skin infection</td></tr></tbody></table></div></li></ul><br />Clearly, the underlying cause of the patient's sepsis needs to be identified and treated and the patient supported regardless of the cause or severity. If however any of the red flags are present the 'sepsis six' should be started straight away:<br /><ul><li>1. Administer oxygen:  Aim to keep saturations > 94% (88-92% if at risk of CO2 retention e.g. COPD)</li><li>2. Take blood cultures</li><li>3. Give broad-spectrum antibiotics</li><li>4. Give intravenous fluid challenges<ul><li>NICE recommend a <span class=\"concept\" data-cid=\"11922\">bolus of 500ml crystalloid over less than 15 minutes</span></li></ul></li><li>5. Measure serum lactate </li><li>6. Measure accurate hourly urine output</li></ul><br />*these patients can be clinically identified by a vasopressor requirement to maintain a MAP \u2265 65mmHg  and serum lactate >2mmol/L in the absence of hypovolemia<br /><br />**To help identify and categorise patients the Sequential (Sepsis-Related) Organ Failure Assessment Score (SOFA) is increasingly used. The score grades abnormality by organ system and accounts for clinical interventions. However, laboratory variables, namely, PaO<sub>2</sub>, platelet count, creatinine level, and bilirubin level, are needed for full computation.<br /><br /><b>SOFA Score</b><br /><div class=\"table-responsive\"><table class = \"tlarge table table-striped table-bordered\"  data-role=\"table\" id=\"tableid2\" ><thead><tr><th><b>System</b></th><th><b>Score 0</b></th><th><b>Score 1</b></th><th><b>Score 2</b></th><th><b>Score 3</b></th><th><b>Score 4</b></th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>PaO<sub>2</sub> /FI O<sub>2</sub></td><td>>400</td><td><400</td><td><300</td><td><200</td><td><100</td></tr><tr><td>Platelets x10<sup>3</sup> microlitres</td><td>>150</td><td><150</td><td><100</td><td><50</td><td><20</td></tr><tr><td>Bilirubin \u00b5mol/L</td><td>20</td><td>20-32</td><td>33-101</td><td>102-204</td><td>>204</td></tr><tr><td>Cardiovascular</td><td>MAP >70mmHg</td><td>MAP 70mmHg</td><td>Dopamine <5 or dobutamine (any dose)</td><td>Dopamine 5.1-15<br />or epinephrine 0.1<br />or norepinephrine 0.1</td><td>Dopamine >15 or<br />epinephrine >0.1<br />or norepinephrine >0.1</td></tr><tr><td>GCS</td><td>15</td><td>13-14</td><td>10-12</td><td>6-9</td><td><6</td></tr><tr><td>Creatinine \u00b5mol/L</td><td><110</td><td>110-170</td><td>171-299</td><td>300-440</td><td>>440</td></tr><tr><td>Urine output ml/day</td><td>>500</td><td>>500</td><td>>500</td><td><500</td><td><200</td></tr></tbody></table></div><br />A SOFA score of 2 or more reflects an overall mortality risk of approximately 10% in a general hospital population with suspected infection.

His fasting glucose sample shows 8.2 mmol/L. Following the world health organisation, symptomatic patients with fasting glucose greater than or equal to 7.0 mmol/L should be diagnosed with diabetes. Given his intermediate age for diabetes type 1 and 2 and the fact he has a risk factor for type 2 diabetes (obesity), NICE guidelines suggest testing of C-peptide. This peptide is the result of the cleavage of proinsulin into insulin.  Very low levels indicate the absolute absence of insulin, indicating type 1 diabetes mellitus. <br /><br />Impaired fasting glucose is incorrect, as the diagnosis is done with fasting glucose greater than or equal to 6.1 but less than 7.0 mmol/L, whilst this patient result indicates fasting glucose of 8.2 mmol/L. <br /><br />Maturity-onset diabetes of the young is an autosomal-dominant disease, and it is characterised by the development of type 2 diabetes mellitus in patients younger than 25 years old.
