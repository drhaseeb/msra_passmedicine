            "The correct answer is <b>Acute myeloid leukaemia</b>. Myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS) are clonal haematopoietic stem cell disorders characterised by ineffective haematopoiesis and a significant risk of transformation to acute myeloid leukaemia (AML). This patient, with a known history of MDS, presents with clinical features of worsening bone marrow failure (fatigue from anaemia, bruising from thrombocytopenia). The crucial finding is in the full blood count. The blast count is 0.8 x 10<sup>9</sup>/L out of a total white cell count of 3.1 x 10<sup>9</sup>/L, which equates to approximately 26% of the circulating white cells. The presence of \u226520% blasts in the peripheral blood or bone marrow is the defining diagnostic criterion for AML according to the World Health Organization (WHO) classification. Therefore, this patient's MDS has transformed into AML. While a bone marrow biopsy is required for definitive confirmation and subtyping, the peripheral blood findings are highly indicative of this diagnosis.<br /><br /><b>Aplastic anaemia</b> is incorrect. While it presents with pancytopenia (low haemoglobin, platelets, and white cells), it is characterised by a hypocellular or 'empty' bone marrow. The pathophysiology involves immune-mediated destruction or intrinsic failure of haematopoietic stem cells, not a clonal proliferation of malignant cells. Therefore, blast cells would not be present in the peripheral blood or bone marrow. This patient's blood film, showing a significant blast population, rules out aplastic anaemia.<br /><br /><b>Myelofibrosis</b> is a less likely diagnosis. Primary myelofibrosis is a myeloproliferative neoplasm that can cause cytopenias, particularly in its later stages, due to the replacement of bone marrow with fibrous tissue. However, the classic peripheral blood film in myelofibrosis shows a leucoerythroblastic picture (immature red and white cell precursors) and dacryocytes (teardrop-shaped red cells). While myelofibrosis can also transform to AML (a 'blast phase'), the scenario of a patient with known MDS developing a high blast count is the classic pathway for MDS-related AML, making it the most probable diagnosis here.<br /><br /><b>Chronic myeloid leukaemia</b> (CML) is incorrect. CML is a myeloproliferative neoplasm typically characterised by a very high white cell count with a predominance of mature and immature granulocytes (neutrophilia, basophilia, eosinophilia) and often marked splenomegaly. The patient in this scenario has a low total white cell count (leukopenia). Although CML can progress to a 'blast crisis', which is functionally a form of AML, the preceding clinical and haematological picture is entirely different from this patient's history of MDS and pancytopenia.<br /><br /><b>Disease progression of myelodysplasia</b> is an imprecise diagnosis. While it is true that the patient's MDS has progressed, this is not the most specific or accurate diagnostic label. The WHO classification provides a clear threshold: once the blast count reaches 20% in the blood or marrow, the diagnosis changes from MDS to AML. Using the term 'disease progression' would understate the severity and change in prognosis and management that the transformation to AML signifies. Therefore, Acute myeloid leukaemia is the correct and most precise diagnosis.",

        "body": "Myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS) encompass a heterogeneous group of clonal hematopoietic stem cell disorders characterized by ineffective hematopoiesis, peripheral blood cytopenias, and a <span class=\"concept\" data-cid=\"2975\">risk of progression to acute myeloid leukaemia (AML)</span>. These disorders predominantly affect older adults, with a median age at diagnosis of 70-75 years.<br /><br /><b>Aetiology and Pathophysiology</b><br /><br />MDS arises from genetic mutations in hematopoietic stem cells. <br /><br />Around 90% of cases are primary with the remaining 10% secondary to causes such as chemotherapy and radiotherapy. <span class=\"concept\" data-cid=\"12069\">Secondary MDS typically develops around 5 years post-treatment</span>.<br /><br />The key pathophysiological feature of MDS is ineffective hematopoiesis leading to peripheral cytopenias despite a typically hypercellular bone marrow. The exact mechanisms are still not entirely understood, but they likely involve a combination of increased apoptosis, abnormal differentiation, and immune dysregulation.<br /><br /><b>Clinical Features</b><br /><br />MDS can present with various symptoms related to the underlying cytopenias. Common presentations include fatigue, weakness, and pallor due to anaemia; recurrent infections due to neutropenia; and easy bruising or bleeding due to thrombocytopenia. Some patients may be asymptomatic and are diagnosed incidentally on routine blood counts.<br /><br /><b>Diagnosis</b><br /><br />The diagnosis of MDS is based on peripheral blood counts, bone marrow examination, and cytogenetic analysis. Bone marrow biopsy typically shows dysplastic changes in hematopoietic cells and a varying degree of blasts. Cytogenetic analysis can identify specific chromosomal abnormalities that may have prognostic implications.<br /><br /><b>Treatment</b><br /><br />Treatment of MDS depends on the subtype of MDS, the patient's age and overall health, and the severity of symptoms. Options include supportive care (e.g., blood transfusions, growth factors), disease-modifying therapy (e.g., hypomethylating agents, lenalidomide), immunosuppressive therapy, and hematopoietic stem cell transplantation. The latter is the only potentially curative option but is limited by the patient's age and comorbidities.",

            "The correct answer is <b>Reactivation of tuberculosis</b>. Etanercept, a tumour necrosis factor (TNF) inhibitor, can lead to reactivation of latent tuberculosis (TB). This is because TNF plays a crucial role in granuloma formation and containment of Mycobacterium tuberculosis. Therefore, inhibiting TNF can disrupt these granulomas and allow for reactivation of the disease. In the UK, guidelines recommend screening for latent TB before starting treatment with etanercept or other TNF inhibitors.<br /><br /><b>Triggering Churg-Strauss syndrome</b> is not associated with etanercept use. Churg-Strauss syndrome, also known as eosinophilic granulomatosis with polyangiitis (EGPA), is an autoimmune condition that causes inflammation and damage to blood vessels. It's typically associated with asthma and high levels of eosinophils - a type of white blood cell. There's no evidence to suggest that etanercept triggers this syndrome.<br /><br /><b>Thrombocytosis</b>, an abnormally high platelet count, is not a recognised side effect of etanercept. Thrombocytosis can occur due to various conditions such as infection, inflammation, cancer or certain blood disorders but it's not linked directly to etanercept use.<br /><br />Regarding <b>Tendonitis</b>, while rheumatoid arthritis itself can cause tendinitis due to chronic inflammation, there's no clear evidence suggesting that etanercept increases the risk of developing tendonitis.<br /><br />Lastly, <b>Cardiomyopathy</b>, a disease of the heart muscle that makes it harder for your heart to pump blood to the rest of your body, is also not directly related to etanercept use. While rheumatoid arthritis patients have an increased risk for cardiovascular diseases due to systemic inflammation and other factors, this isn't specifically linked to the use of etanercept.<br />",

        "question": "A 28-year-old woman who has rheumatoid arthritis is to be started on etanercept injections after failing to respond to methotrexate and sulfsalazine. Which one of the following adverse effects is associated with the use of etanercept?",
        "correct_answer": "5",
        "question_notes": "The correct answer is <b>Reactivation of tuberculosis</b>. Etanercept, a tumour necrosis factor (TNF) inhibitor, can lead to reactivation of latent tuberculosis (TB). This is because TNF plays a crucial role in granuloma formation and containment of Mycobacterium tuberculosis. Therefore, inhibiting TNF can disrupt these granulomas and allow for reactivation of the disease. In the UK, guidelines recommend screening for latent TB before starting treatment with etanercept or other TNF inhibitors.<br /><br /><b>Triggering Churg-Strauss syndrome</b> is not associated with etanercept use. Churg-Strauss syndrome, also known as eosinophilic granulomatosis with polyangiitis (EGPA), is an autoimmune condition that causes inflammation and damage to blood vessels. It's typically associated with asthma and high levels of eosinophils - a type of white blood cell. There's no evidence to suggest that etanercept triggers this syndrome.<br /><br /><b>Thrombocytosis</b>, an abnormally high platelet count, is not a recognised side effect of etanercept. Thrombocytosis can occur due to various conditions such as infection, inflammation, cancer or certain blood disorders but it's not linked directly to etanercept use.<br /><br />Regarding <b>Tendonitis</b>, while rheumatoid arthritis itself can cause tendinitis due to chronic inflammation, there's no clear evidence suggesting that etanercept increases the risk of developing tendonitis.<br /><br />Lastly, <b>Cardiomyopathy</b>, a disease of the heart muscle that makes it harder for your heart to pump blood to the rest of your body, is also not directly related to etanercept use. While rheumatoid arthritis patients have an increased risk for cardiovascular diseases due to systemic inflammation and other factors, this isn't specifically linked to the use of etanercept.<br />",

Typical features include anxiety, agitation, headache, sweating, paraesthesiae (the so-called \u201cbrain zaps\u201d) and flu-like feelings, all of which the patient describes.

Drops of diluted allergen are placed on the skin after which the skin is pierced using a needle. A large number of allergens can be tested in one session. Normally includes a histamine (positive) and sterile water (negative) control. A wheal will typically develop if a patient has an allergy. Can be interpreted after 15 minutes<br /><br />Useful for food allergies and also pollen</td></tr><tr><td><b>Radioallergosorbent test (RAST)</b></td><td>Determines the amount of IgE that reacts specifically with suspected or known allergens, for example IgE to egg protein. Results are given in grades from 0 (negative) to 6 (strongly positive)<br /><br />Useful for food allergies, inhaled allergens (e.g. Pollen) and wasp/bee venom<br /><br />Blood tests may be used when skin prick tests are not suitable, for example if there is extensive eczema or if the patient is taking antihistamines</td></tr><tr><td><b>Skin patch testing</b></td><td>Useful for contact dermatitis. Around 30-40 allergens are placed on the back. Irritants may also be tested for. The patches are removed 48 hours later with the results being read by a dermatologist after a further 48 hours</td></tr></tbody></table></div>",
