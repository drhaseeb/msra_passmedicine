First, we can tell that the patient has a normal paO<sub>2</sub>, making a respiratory cause of her symptoms less likely. Her pH is, however, under 7.35, indicating an acidosis. Her bicarbonate is low, suggesting metabolic acidosis. Her low paCO<sub>2</sub> shows some efforts to compensate. This is a partially compensated metabolic acidosis. To determine the cause of metabolic acidosis, the anion gap can be calculated. The anion gap is calculated by calculating the difference between positively charged ions (sodium and potassium) and negatively charged ions (bicarbonate and chloride). In this case (143 + 5) - (17 + 100) gives an anion gap of 31 mmol/L. A normal anion gap is 8-14 mmol/L. This patient, therefore, has metabolic acidosis with a raised anion gap. Raised anion gap shows there is excess acid in the blood. The only listed cause of raised anion gap metabolic acidosis is <b>septic shock</b>, which results in acidosis due to the production of lactic acid due to inadequate tissue perfusion.<br /><br /><b>Addison's disease</b> is another cause of metabolic acidosis. However, in this case, there is a normal anion gap metabolic acidosis. This is because the acidosis is caused by loss of bicarbonate, rather than gain of acid, due to mineralocorticoid deficiency. Addison's disease is also not in keeping with the electrolyte values seen in this patient. Patients with Addison's typically have hyponatraemia and hyperkalaemia. <br /><br /><b>Prolonged diarrhoea</b> could result in a collapse due to dehydration and electrolyte imbalance. Diarrhoea can also cause metabolic acidosis. However, this is not due to the addition of acid, but rather due to loss of the base, due to gastrointestinal loss of bicarbonate. Diarrhoea is therefore a cause of normal anion gap metabolic acidosis. <br /><br /><b>Pulmonary embolism</b> is a cause of hypocapnia, as seen in this patient, due to hyperventilation. However, it would be unlikely for a patient with a pulmonary embolism significant enough to cause collapse to have normal oxygen levels. Furthermore, hypocapnia alone causes alkalosis.  This patient is acidotic, meaning the hypocapnia is occurring as compensation. This profile does not fit a patient with a pulmonary embolism. <br /><br /><b>Prolonged vomiting</b> could, again, result in a collapse due to dehydration and electrolyte imbalance. However, vomiting does not cause metabolic acidosis. It instead causes metabolic alkalosis, due to the loss of hydrogen ions in vomit. There is also a loss of chloride, creating a hypochloraemic metabolic alkalosis. This patient's electrolyte profile does not fit with prolonged vomiting.",

This condition, also known as Osler-Weber-Rendu syndrome, is a genetic disorder characterised by abnormal blood vessel formation in the skin, mucous membranes, and often in organs such as the lungs, liver, and brain. The erythematous lesions seen on the skin of this patient are likely telangiectasias - small dilated blood vessels near the surface of the skin.

            "The correct answer is to <b>add oral ibuprofen + proton pump inhibitor</b>. This is because the patient's pain from osteoarthritis is not being adequately controlled by co-codamol, which is a combination of paracetamol and codeine. The National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) guidelines in the UK recommend adding a non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID), such as ibuprofen, if paracetamol or topical NSAIDs are ineffective. A proton pump inhibitor (PPI) should be co-prescribed with an NSAID to reduce the risk of adverse gastrointestinal side effects, especially in older patients.<br /><br />Discussing the incorrect options:<br /><br /><b>Switch to regular oral tramadol</b>: While tramadol is a stronger analgesic than co-codamol, it's not recommended as first-line therapy due to its potential for addiction and side effects such as nausea, vomiting, constipation and drowsiness. Furthermore, NICE guidelines suggest that opioids like tramadol should only be considered after the failure of at least three other analgesics.<br /><br /><b>Add topical ibuprofen</b>: Topical NSAIDs can be effective for relieving pain from osteoarthritis. However, this patient's pain is not being controlled by her current medication so it's likely she needs systemic rather than topical treatment.<br /><br /><b>Add oral etoricoxib</b>: Etoricoxib is a type of NSAID known as a COX-2 inhibitor. These drugs can also be effective for treating osteoarthritis pain but they carry a higher risk of cardiovascular side effects compared to traditional NSAIDs like ibuprofen. Therefore, they're generally only used when other treatments have failed or are contraindicated.<br /><br /><b>Add oral diclofenac</b>: Diclofenac is another type of NSAID that could potentially help manage this patient's pain. However, it carries a higher risk of cardiovascular side effects compared to ibuprofen and therefore would not be the first choice according to UK guidelines.<br />",

            "The correct answer is <b>Central retinal artery occlusion</b>. The patient's presentation of sudden, painless vision loss in one eye, poor direct pupillary light response, normal consensual light reaction, and fundoscopic findings of a pale and opaque retina with a cherry-red spot are classic features of central retinal artery occlusion (CRAO).

This condition presents with sudden, painless vision loss or floaters in the affected eye. However, the fundoscopic examination would reveal blood within the vitreous humour rather than a pale and opaque retina with a cherry-red spot.<br /><br />The second incorrect option is <b>Retinal detachment</b>. Although this condition can also present with sudden, painless vision loss or floaters in the affected eye, it is often accompanied by flashes of light or a curtain-like shadow over the visual field. Fundoscopy would reveal an elevated retina separated from the underlying choroid layer.<br /><br />The third incorrect option is <b>Ischaemic optic neuropathy</b>.

However, it does not cause a pale and opaque retina with a cherry-red spot.<br /><br />Lastly, the fourth incorrect option is <b>Central retinal vein occlusion</b>.
