This patient has asthma that is not controlled on moderate-dose MART therapy, as evidenced by her ongoing symptoms (wheeze and nocturnal symptoms twice weekly).

When either of these biomarkers is raised in a patient with uncontrolled asthma on moderate-dose MART, the guidelines explicitly recommend referral to a specialist in asthma care.

        "body": "In 2024 NICE, the British Thoracic Society and SIGN produced joint guidelines on the management of asthma following many years of conflicting guidelines. The new guidelines represent a major step change in the management of asthma is both diagnosed and treated.<br /><br />For many years patients with asthma were started on a short-acting beta-2 agonist (SABA) inhaler before 'stepping up' to a regular inhaled corticosteroid with a SABA as required. The new guidelines now advocate the use of combined inhalers (ICS + long-acting beta-2 agonist) as reliever therapy or regularly, depending on the severity of asthma. Given the prevalence of asthma, it is likely that doctors will have to deal with patients on 'conventional' asthma treatments for many years to come. The joint guidelines therefore include guidance on how to manage these patients if their current treatment is controlling their symptoms sufficiently.<br /><br /><h5 class='notes-heading'>Management of adult patients aged children aged \u2265 12 years with newly diagnosed asthma</h5><br />Step 1 <a href='https://www.nice.org.uk/guidance/ng245/chapter/Recommendations#pharmacological-management-in-people-aged-12-and-over:~:text=and%20over.-,Initial%20management%20of%20newly%20diagnosed%20asthma%20in%20people%20aged%2012%20and%20over,-1.7.1' title='NICE - 2024 Asthma: diagnosis, monitoring and chronic asthma management (BTS, NICE, SIGN)' target='_blank' class='badge rounded-pill text-bg-light deeplink'>NICE</a><ul><li>a <span class=\"concept\" data-cid=\"12286\">low-dose inhaled corticosteroid (ICS)/formoterol combination inhaler to be taken as needed for symptom relief</span><ul><li>this is termed anti-inflammatory reliever (AIR) therapy</li></ul></li><li>if the patient presents highly symptomatic (for example, regular nocturnal waking) or with a severe exacerbation:<ul><li><span class=\"concept\" data-cid=\"12295\">start treatment with low-dose MART</span> (maintenance and reliever therapy, see below)</li><li>treat the acute symptoms as appropriate (e.g. a course of oral corticosteroids may be indicated)</li></ul></li></ul><br />Step 2  <a href='https://www.nice.org.uk/guidance/ng245/chapter/Recommendations#pharmacological-management-in-people-aged-12-and-over:~:text=asthma%20management.-,Medicine%20combination%20and%20sequencing%20in%20people%20aged%2012%20and%20over,-For%20guidance%20on' title='NICE - 2024 Asthma: diagnosis, monitoring and chronic asthma management (BTS, NICE, SIGN)' target='_blank' class='badge rounded-pill text-bg-light deeplink'>NICE</a> <br /><ul><li><span class=\"concept\" data-cid=\"12287\">a low-dose MART</span><ul><li>MART describes using an inhaled corticosteroid (ICS)/formoterol combination inhaler for daily maintenance therapy and the relief of symptoms as needed, i.e. regularly and as required</li></ul></li></ul><br />Step 3<br /><ul><li>a <span class=\"concept\" data-cid=\"12288\">moderate-dose MART</span></li></ul><br />Step 4<br /><ul><li><span class=\"concept\" data-cid=\"12289\">check the fractional exhaled nitric oxide (FeNO) level if available, and the blood eosinophil count</span>  <a href='https://www.nice.org.uk/guidance/ng245/chapter/Recommendations#pharmacological-management-in-people-aged-12-and-over:~:text=Check%20the%20fractional%20exhaled%20nitric%20oxide%20(FeNO)%20level%20if%20available' title='NICE - 2024 Asthma: diagnosis, monitoring and chronic asthma management (BTS, NICE, SIGN)' target='_blank' class='badge rounded-pill text-bg-light deeplink'>NICE</a> <ul><li>if <span class=\"concept\" data-cid=\"12290\">either of these is raised, refer to a specialist in asthma care</span></li><li>if <span class=\"concept\" data-cid=\"12291\">neither FeNO nor eosinophil count is raised, consider a trial of either a leukotriene receptor antagonist (LTRA) or a long-acting muscarinic receptor antagonist (LAMA)</span> used in addition to moderate-dose MART</li><li>if control has not improved, stop the LTRA or LAMA and start a trial of the alternative medicine (LTRA or LAMA)</li></ul></li></ul><br />Step 5<br /><ul><li><span class=\"concept\" data-cid=\"12292\">refer people to a specialist in asthma care</span> when asthma is not controlled despite treatment with moderate-dose MART, and trials of an LTRA and a LAMA</li></ul><br /><div class=\"container\"><div class=\"row\"><div class=\"col-md-3\"><a href=\"https://d32xxyeh8kfs8k.cloudfront.net/images_Passmedicine/pdd602b.png\" data-fancybox=\"gallery\" data-caption=\"Algorithm showing pharmacological management of asthma in people aged 12 years and over\"><img  class=\"img-thumbnail mx-auto d-block\" style=\"max-height:150px;margin-bottom:10px;\" src=\"https://d32xxyeh8kfs8k.cloudfront.net/images_Passmedicine/pdd602.png\" alt=\"\" /></a></div></div></div><br /><h5 class='notes-heading'>Transferring people aged 12 and over from other treatment pathways</h5><br />There will be many people whose asthma was managed according to the previous guidelines that present with uncontrolled asthmatic symptoms.

It also recommends not routinely offering <i>'<span class=\"concept\" data-cid=\"11932\">antidepressant medication as first-line treatment for less severe depression, unless that is the person's preference</span>'.</i><br /><br />Treatment options, listed in order of preference by NICE<br /><ul><li><span class=\"concept\" data-cid=\"11931\">guided self-help</span></li><li>group cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT)</li><li>group behavioural activation (BA)</li><li>individual CBT</li><li>individual BA</li><li>group exercise</li><li>group mindfulness and meditation</li><li>interpersonal psychotherapy (IPT)</li><li><span class=\"concept\" data-cid=\"10936\">selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs)</span></li><li>counselling</li><li>short-term psychodynamic psychotherapy (STPP)</li></ul><br /><h5 class='notes-heading'>Management of more severe depression</h5><br />Again, NICE recommend a shared decision should be made. <br /><br />Treatment options, listed in order of preference by NICE<br /><ul><li><span class=\"concept\" data-cid=\"11930\">a combination of individual cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT) and an antidepressant</span></li><li>individual CBT</li><li>individual behavioural activation (BA)</li><li>antidepressant medication<ul><li>selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI), or</li><li>serotonin-norepinephrine reuptake inhibitor (SNRI), or</li><li>another antidepressant if indicated based on previous clinical and treatment history</li></ul></li><li>individual problem-solving</li><li>counselling</li><li>short-term psychodynamic psychotherapy (STPP)</li><li>interpersonal psychotherapy (IPT)</li><li>guided self-help</li><li>group exercise</li></ul>",

This patient has multiple risk factors for non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD), including obesity (BMI 34) and type 2 diabetes. The ultrasound finding of fatty infiltration confirms the diagnosis of hepatic steatosis. The liver function tests show a raised ALT, which is greater than the AST, a pattern characteristic of NAFLD. According to UK NICE guidelines (NG49), once NAFLD is suspected (typically from an ultrasound finding), the next step is to assess for advanced fibrosis, as this determines prognosis and the need for specialist referral. The NICE-recommended first-line investigation for this is the Enhanced Liver Fibrosis (ELF) blood test.

It is relatively common and thought to affect around 3-4% of the general population. The progression of disease in patients with NASH may be responsible for a proportion of patients previously labelled as cryptogenic cirrhosis.<br /><br />Associated factors<br /><ul><li><span class=\"concept\" data-cid=\"11101\">obesity</span></li><li><span class=\"concept\" data-cid=\"721\">type 2 diabetes mellitus</span></li><li>hyperlipidaemia</li><li>jejunoileal bypass</li><li><span class=\"concept\" data-cid=\"4462\">sudden weight loss/starvation</span></li></ul><br />Features<br /><ul><li>usually asymptomatic</li><li>hepatomegaly</li><li><span class=\"concept\" data-cid=\"3981\">ALT is typically greater than AST</span></li><li>increased echogenicity on ultrasound</li></ul><br />NICE produced guidelines on the investigation and management of NAFLD in 2016. Key points:<br /><ul><li>there is no evidence to support screening for NAFLD in adults, even in at risk groups (e.g. type 2 diabetes)</li><li>the guidelines are therefore based on the management of the <i>incidental</i> finding of NAFLD - typically asymptomatic fatty changes on liver ultrasound</li><li>in these patients, NICE recommends the use of the <span class=\"concept\" data-cid=\"8322\">enhanced liver fibrosis (ELF)</span> blood test to check for advanced fibrosis</li><li>the ELF blood test is a combination of hyaluronic acid + procollagen III + tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinase 1. An algorithm based on these values results in an ELF blood test score, similar to triple testing for Down's syndrome</li></ul><br />An excellent review by Byrne et Al<sup>1</sup> in 2018 reviewed the diagnosis and monitoring of NAFLD. It made the following suggestions if the ELF blood test was not available:<br /><ul><li>non-invasive tests may be used to assess the severity of fibrosis</li><li>these include the FIB4 score or NALFD fibrosis score</li><li>these scores may be used in combination with a FibroScan (liver stiffness measurement assessed with transient elastography)</li><li>this combination has been shown to have excellent accuracy in predicting fibrosis</li></ul><br />Patients who are likely to have advanced fibrosis should be referred to a liver specialist. They will then likely have a liver biopsy to stage the disease more accurately.<br /><br />Management<br /><ul><li>the mainstay of treatment is lifestyle changes (particularly <span class=\"concept\" data-cid=\"3604\">weight loss</span>) and monitoring</li><li>there is ongoing research into the role of gastric banding and insulin-sensitising drugs (e.g. metformin, <span class=\"concept\" data-cid=\"1538\">pioglitazone</span>)</li></ul><br /><b>References</b><br />1.
