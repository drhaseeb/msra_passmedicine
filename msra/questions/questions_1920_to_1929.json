BTS guidelines state: 'Diving should be permanently avoided unless the patient has undergone bilateral surgical pleurectomy and has normal lung function and chest CT scan postoperatively.'<br /><br />Avoid flying for the next month - incorrect. Current BTS guidelines recommend that patients be free to fly one week after having a chest x-ray which shows complete resolution of the pneumothorax.<br /><br />Increased risk of catamenial pneumothoraces - incorrect. Catamenial pneumothoraces are pneumothoraces that occurs in association with menses, secondary to thoracic endometriosis.  Although having a previous pneumothorax is a risk factor for developing another in the future, this patient is of course not at risk of developing this type of pneumothorax. <br /><br />Pleurodesis - incorrect. Pleurodesis is a procedure performed to obliterate the pleural space to prevent recurrent pleural effusions, pneumothorax, or to treat a persistent pneumothorax. It is an invasive procedure that would not be performed for a single pneumothorax, whether or not it was primary or secondary. <br /><br />Secondary pneumothoraces have the lowest incidence of recurrence  - incorrect.

        "question": "A 68-year-old man with COPD presents to the emergency department with right-sided chest pain and shortness of breath that developed over the last 3 days. <br /><br />A chest x-ray showed a 1.8cm right-sided apical pneumothorax which the emergency physician on call promptly aspirated. The man had an uneventful recovery but wants to know how he can prevent any further recurrences.<br /><br />What should the patient be advised?",
        "correct_answer": "1",
        "question_notes": "Avoid deep-sea diving - correct. He should be told to avoid deep-sea diving for life. BTS guidelines state: 'Diving should be permanently avoided unless the patient has undergone bilateral surgical pleurectomy and has normal lung function and chest CT scan postoperatively.'<br /><br />Avoid flying for the next month - incorrect. Current BTS guidelines recommend that patients be free to fly one week after having a chest x-ray which shows complete resolution of the pneumothorax.<br /><br />Increased risk of catamenial pneumothoraces - incorrect. Catamenial pneumothoraces are pneumothoraces that occurs in association with menses, secondary to thoracic endometriosis.  Although having a previous pneumothorax is a risk factor for developing another in the future, this patient is of course not at risk of developing this type of pneumothorax. <br /><br />Pleurodesis - incorrect. Pleurodesis is a procedure performed to obliterate the pleural space to prevent recurrent pleural effusions, pneumothorax, or to treat a persistent pneumothorax. It is an invasive procedure that would not be performed for a single pneumothorax, whether or not it was primary or secondary. <br /><br />Secondary pneumothoraces have the lowest incidence of recurrence  - incorrect.

            "The correct answer is <b>Visual acuity</b>. Hydroxychloroquine, an antimalarial drug, is commonly used in the treatment of systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE). The most significant and potentially serious side effect of hydroxychloroquine is retinopathy, which can lead to permanent vision loss. Therefore, it is crucial to monitor the patient's visual acuity regularly. According to the Royal College of Ophthalmologists in the UK, baseline eye screening should be performed within a year of starting treatment and then annually after five years of usage.<br /><br /><b>Blood pressure</b> monitoring may be important for patients with SLE as they may have an increased risk of cardiovascular disease due to chronic inflammation and corticosteroid use. However, it is not specifically related to hydroxychloroquine therapy.<br /><br />Monitoring <b>Blood sugar</b> levels would be more relevant if the patient was started on corticosteroids or if they had a pre-existing condition like diabetes mellitus. Hydroxychloroquine does not typically cause hyperglycaemia.<br /><br /><b>QT interval on ECG</b> monitoring might be necessary when prescribing medications known to prolong the QT interval and increase the risk of torsades de pointes and other arrhythmias. Although hydroxychloroquine can theoretically prolong QT interval, this side effect is extremely rare in clinical practice so routine ECG monitoring isn't necessary unless there are other contributing factors.<br /><br />Lastly, <b>Peak expiratory flow rate</b> would be monitored in conditions affecting lung function such as asthma or chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). There's no specific indication for its regular assessment in patients taking hydroxychloroquine unless they have a concurrent respiratory illness.",
