            "<b>Laparoscopic salpingectomy and monitoring</b> is correct. This patient has acute-onset abdominal pain and vaginal bleeding after 6-8 weeks following her last period which should raise suspicion of an ectopic pregnancy. The positive pregnancy tests and ultrasound findings confirm this diagnosis. Given that the size of the ectopic pregnancy is greater than 35 mm, and the beta-hCG levels are higher than 5000 IU/L, the most appropriate step in this patient's management is surgical, either via a laparoscopic salpingectomy (removal of the affected tube) or salpingotomy (removal of the ectopic pregnancy material and retaining the tube). The preferred method depends on the status of the other tube and the woman's desire for future fertility. Given that there is nothing to suggest the contralateral tube is affected, the ideal choice in management would be a salpingectomy, as a salpingotomy may require further treatment with methotrexate and may not remove the ectopic pregnancy entirely. There is no evidence to suggest that a salpingotomy is better than a salpingectomy if the contralateral tube is normal, therefore it would be more appropriate to perform a salpingectomy.<br /><br /><b>Expectant management and monitoring</b> is incorrect. This would be an appropriate option if the size of the ectopic pregnancy was less than 35 mm, the beta-hCG levels were less than 1000 IU/L, no foetal heartbeat was present, and the patient was asymptomatic. Except for the absence of a foetal heartbeat, these do not apply to this patient, therefore making expectant management less appropriate.<br /><br /><b>Laparoscopic salpingotomy and monitoring</b> is incorrect. This would be appropriate if this patient had a past medical history of a condition affecting the contralateral tube or reducing her fertility, such as a previous salpingectomy or pelvic inflammatory disease. The reason for this is that this would preserve future fertility if desired. Since this patient has none of these present in her history, the most appropriate step would be a salpingectomy, as a salpingotomy may not entirely remove all the tissue and further treatment with additional methotrexate may be necessary.<br /><br /><b>Methotrexate and monitoring</b> is incorrect. This would be appropriate if the patient had no significant pain, the size of the ectopic pregnancy was <35 mm, the beta-hCG was less than 1500 IU/L, and no foetal heartbeat was present.

        "body": "Parkinsons disease should only be diagnosed, and management initiated, by a <span class=\"concept\" data-cid=\"5645\">specialist</span> with expertise in movement disorders. However, it is important for all doctors to be aware of the medications used in Parkinson's given the prevalence of this condition. NICE published guidelines in 2017 regarding the management of Parkinson's disease.<br /><br />For first-line treatment:<br /><ul><li>if the motor symptoms are affecting the patient's quality of life: <span class=\"concept\" data-cid=\"1213\">levodopa</span></li><li>if the motor symptoms are not affecting the patient's quality of life: dopamine agonist (non-ergot derived), levodopa or monoamine oxidase B (MAO-B) inhibitor</li></ul><br />Whilst all drugs used to treat Parkinson's can cause a wide variety of side-effects NICE produced tables to help with decision making:<br /><br /><div class=\"table-responsive\"><table class = \"tlarge table table-striped table-bordered\"  data-role=\"table\" id=\"tableid1\" ><thead><tr><th></th><th>Levodopa</th><th>Dopamine agonists</th><th>MAO-B inhibitors</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td><b>Motor symptoms</b></td><td><span class=\"concept\" data-cid=\"1214\">More improvement in motor symptoms</span></td><td>Less improvement in motor symptoms</td><td>Less improvement in motor symptoms</td></tr><tr><td><b>Activities of daily living</b></td><td><span class=\"concept\" data-cid=\"1214\">More improvement in activities of daily living</span></td><td>Less improvement in activities of daily living</td><td>Less improvement in activities of daily living</td></tr><tr><td><b>Motor complications</b></td><td>More motor complications</td><td>Fewer motor complications</td><td>Fewer motor complications</td></tr><tr><td><b>Adverse events</b></td><td>Fewer specified adverse events*</td><td>More specified adverse events*</td><td>Fewer specified adverse events*</td></tr></tbody></table></div>* excessive sleepiness, <span class=\"concept\" data-cid=\"4334\">hallucinations</span> and impulse control disorders<br /><br />If a patient continues to have symptoms despite optimal levodopa treatment or has developed dyskinesia then NICE recommend the addition of a dopamine agonist, MAO-B inhibitor or catechol-O-methyl transferase (COMT) inhibitor as an adjunct. Again, NICE summarise the main points in terms of decision making:<br /><br /><div class=\"table-responsive\"><table class = \"tlarge table table-striped table-bordered\"  data-role=\"table\" id=\"tableid2\" ><thead><tr><th></th><th>Dopamine agonists</th><th>MAO-B inhibitors</th><th>COMT inhibitors</th><th>Amantadine</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td><b>Motor symptoms</b></td><td>Improvement in motor symptoms</td><td>Improvement in motor symptoms</td><td>Improvement in motor symptoms</td><td>No evidence of improvement in motor symptoms</td></tr><tr><td><b>Activities of daily living</b></td><td>Improvement in activities of daily living</td><td>Improvement in activities of daily living</td><td>Improvement in activities of daily living</td><td>No evidence of improvement in activities of daily living</td></tr><tr><td><b>Off time</b></td><td>More off-time reduction</td><td>Off-time reduction</td><td>Off-time reduction</td><td>No studies reporting this outcome</td></tr><tr><td><b>Adverse events</b></td><td>Intermediate risk of adverse events</td><td>Fewer adverse events</td><td>More adverse events</td><td>No studies reporting this outcome</td></tr><tr><td><b>Hallucinations</b></td><td><span class=\"concept\" data-cid=\"4334\">More risk of hallucinations</span></td><td>Lower risk of hallucinations</td><td>Lower risk of hallucinations</td><td>No studies reporting this outcome</td></tr></tbody></table></div><br /><br /><h5 class='notes-heading'>Specific points regarding Parkinson's medication</h5><br />NICE reminds us of the risk of acute akinesia or neuroleptic malignant syndrome if medication is not taken/absorbed (for example due to gastroenteritis) and advise against giving patients a 'drug holiday' for the same reason.<br /><br />Impulse control disorders have become a significant issue in recent years. These can occur with any dopaminergic therapy but are more common with:<br /><ul><li><span class=\"concept\" data-cid=\"5640\">dopamine agonist therapy</span></li><li>a history of previous impulsive behaviours</li><li>a history of alcohol consumption and/or smoking</li></ul><br />If excessive daytime sleepiness develops then patients should not drive. Medication should be adjusted to control symptoms. Modafinil can be considered if alternative strategies fail.<br /><br />If orthostatic hypotension develops then a medication review looking at potential causes should be done. If symptoms persist then midodrine (acts on peripheral alpha-adrenergic receptors to increase arterial resistance) can be considered.<br /><br /><span class=\"concept\" data-cid=\"9533\">Consider glycopyrronium bromide to manage drooling of saliva in people with Parkinson's disease.</span><br /><br /><h5 class='notes-heading'>Further information regarding specific anti-Parkinson's medication</h5><br /><br />Levodopa<br /><ul><li>nearly always combined with a decarboxylase inhibitor (e.g. carbidopa or benserazide)<ul><li>this prevents the peripheral metabolism of levodopa to dopamine outside of the brain and hence can reduce side effects</li></ul></li><li>common adverse effects: <ul><li><span class=\"concept\" data-cid=\"6272\">dry mouth</span></li><li><span class=\"concept\" data-cid=\"6273\">anorexia</span></li><li><span class=\"concept\" data-cid=\"6274\">palpitations</span></li><li><span class=\"concept\" data-cid=\"6275\">postural hypotension</span></li><li><span class=\"concept\" data-cid=\"6276\">psychosis</span></li></ul></li><li>some adverse effects are due to the difficulty in achieving a steady dose of levodopa<ul><li><span class=\"concept\" data-cid=\"11755\">end-of-dose wearing off</span>: symptoms often worsen towards the end of dosage interval. This results in a decline of motor activity</li><li><span class=\"concept\" data-cid=\"11756\">'on-off' phenomenon</span>: large variations in motor performance, with normal function during the 'on' period, and weakness and restricted mobility during the 'off' period</li><li><span class=\"concept\" data-cid=\"6277\">dyskinesias at peak dose: dystonia, chorea and athetosis (involuntary writhing movements)</span></li><li>these effects may worsen over time with - clinicians therefore may limit doses until necessary</li></ul></li><li>it is important <span class=\"concept\" data-cid=\"5641\">not to acutely stop levodopa</span>, for example, if a patient is admitted to hospital<ul><li>if a patient with Parkinson's disease cannot take levodopa orally, they can be given a dopamine agonist patch as <span class=\"concept\" data-cid=\"5643\">rescue medication</span> to prevent acute dystonia</li></ul></li></ul><br />Dopamine receptor agonists<br /><ul><li>e.g. <span class=\"concept\" data-cid=\"6282\">bromocriptine</span>, <span class=\"concept\" data-cid=\"665\">ropinirole</span>, <span class=\"concept\" data-cid=\"6284\">cabergoline</span>, <span class=\"concept\" data-cid=\"6285\">apomorphine</span></li><li>ergot-derived dopamine receptor agonists (bromocriptine, cabergoline) have been associated with <span class=\"concept\" data-cid=\"6278\">pulmonary, retroperitoneal and cardiac fibrosis</span>.

It may involve any of the following:<br /><ul><li>surgery</li><li>radiotherapy</li><li>hormone therapy</li><li>biological therapy</li><li>chemotherapy</li></ul><br /><h5 class='notes-heading'>Surgery</h5><br />The vast majority of patients who have breast cancer diagnosed will be offered surgery. An exception may be a very frail, elderly lady with metastatic disease who may be better managed with hormonal therapy.<br /><br />Prior to surgery, the presence/absence of axillary lymphadenopathy determines management:<br /><ul><li><span class=\"concept\" data-cid=\"10185\">women with no palpable axillary lymphadenopathy at presentation should have a pre-operative axillary ultrasound</span> before their primary surgery<ul><li><span class=\"concept\" data-cid=\"10186\">if negative then they should have a sentinel node biopsy to assess the nodal burden</span></li></ul></li><li><span class=\"concept\" data-cid=\"10189\">in patients with breast cancer who present with clinically palpable lymphadenopathy, axillary node clearance is indicated at primary surgery</span><ul><li><span class=\"concept\" data-cid=\"10191\">this may lead to arm lymphedema and functional arm impairment</span></li></ul></li></ul><br />Depending on the characteristics of the tumour women either have a wide-local excision or a mastectomy. Around two-thirds of tumours can be removed with a wide-local excision. The table below lists some of the factors determining which operation is offered:<br /><br /><div class=\"table-responsive\"><table class = \"tlarge table table-striped table-bordered\"  data-role=\"table\" id=\"tableid1\" ><thead><tr><th><b>Mastectomy</b></th><th><b>Wide Local Excision</b></th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Multifocal tumour</td><td>Solitary lesion</td></tr><tr><td>Central tumour</td><td>Peripheral tumour</td></tr><tr><td>Large lesion in small breast</td><td>Small lesion in large breast</td></tr><tr><td>DCIS > 4cm</td><td>DCIS < 4cm</td></tr></tbody></table></div><br />Women should be offered breast reconstruction to achieve a cosmetically suitable result regardless of the type of operation they have. For women who've had a mastectomy this may be done at the initial operation or at a later date.<br /><br /><h5 class='notes-heading'>Radiotherapy</h5><br /><span class=\"concept\" data-cid=\"9151\">Whole breast radiotherapy is recommended after a woman has had a wide-local excision as this may reduce the risk of recurrence by around two-thirds</span>. For women who've had a mastectomy radiotherapy is offered for T3-T4 tumours and for those with four or more positive axillary nodes<br /><br /><h5 class='notes-heading'>Hormonal therapy</h5><br />Adjuvant hormonal therapy is offered if tumours are positive for hormone receptors. For many years this was done using tamoxifen for 5 years after diagnosis. <span class=\"concept\" data-cid=\"3967\">Tamoxifen is still used in pre- and peri-menopausal women</span>. In <span class=\"concept\" data-cid=\"1261\">post-menopausal women, aromatase inhibitors such as anastrozole</span> are used for this purpose*. This is important as aromatisation accounts for the majority of oestrogen production in post-menopausal women and therefore anastrozole is used for ER +ve breast cancer in this group. <br /><br />Important side effects of tamoxifen include an increased risk of endometrial cancer, venous thromboembolism and menopausal symptoms.<br /><br /><h5 class='notes-heading'>Biological therapy</h5><br />The most common type of biological therapy used for breast cancer is <span class=\"concept\" data-cid=\"3966\">trastuzumab (Herceptin)</span>. It is only useful in the 20-25% of tumours that are <span class=\"concept\" data-cid=\"3966\">HER2 positive</span>.<br /><br />Trastuzumab cannot be used in patients with a history of heart disorders.<br /><br /><h5 class='notes-heading'>Chemotherapy</h5><br />Cytotoxic therapy may be used either prior to surgery ('neoadjuvanant' chemotherapy) to <span class=\"concept\" data-cid=\"10193\">downstage a primary lesion</span> or after surgery depending on the stage of the tumour, for example, if there is <span class=\"concept\" data-cid=\"3968\">axillary node disease - FEC-D is used in this situation</span>.",

            "<b>Laparoscopic salpingotomy and monitoring</b> is correct. This patient has acute-onset abdominal pain and vaginal bleeding after 6-8 weeks following her last period which should raise suspicion of an ectopic pregnancy. The positive pregnancy tests and ultrasound findings confirm this diagnosis. Given that the size of the ectopic pregnancy is greater than 35 mm, and the beta-hCG levels are higher than 5000 IU/L, the most appropriate step in this patient's management is surgical, either via a laparoscopic salpingectomy (removal of the affected tube) or salpingotomy (removal of the ectopic pregnancy material and retaining the tube). The preferred method depends on the status of the other tube and the woman's desire for future fertility. Given that she has pelvic inflammatory disease (PID) requiring hospitalisation that has led to scarring of the contralateral tube, the ideal method of choice would be a salpingotomy. This preserves the affected tube and means that her fertility is preserved.<br /><br /><b>Expectant management and monitoring</b> is incorrect.

Although this is another option for surgery in the management of ectopic pregnancy, it would be less appropriate to remove the affected tube in its entirety as this patient has a history of PID requiring hospitalisation and subsequent contralateral fallopian tube scarring.

The key features supporting this diagnosis are the \u201cruddy\u201d facial complexion and a history of gout caused by increased uric acid turnover. Pruritus in polycythaemia vera is often aquagenic, meaning it is triggered or worsened by contact with warm water, such as after a shower or bath. The underlying cause is abnormal proliferation of red cell precursors leading to increased blood viscosity and histamine release from basophils and mast cells.",
            "This woman\u2019s presentation is suggestive of chronic liver disease. The clues include pruritus, easy bruising, palmar erythema, and abdominal distension, which is likely due to ascites. Pruritus in liver disease results from the accumulation of bile salts and other pruritogenic substances in the skin secondary to cholestasis. Common causes include primary biliary cholangitis, autoimmune hepatitis, and alcohol-related liver disease. Management typically involves treating the underlying condition and the use of bile acid sequestrants such as cholestyramine to relieve itching.",
            "Although this patient attributes her symptoms to the menopause, her age and accompanying systemic features make lymphoma more likely. Generalised pruritus can be an early symptom of Hodgkin lymphoma, often associated with constitutional \u201cB\u201d symptoms such as night sweats, lethargy, and unexplained weight loss. The itching is thought to be due to cytokine release from malignant lymphocytes. Given her relatively young age and systemic symptoms, lymphoma should be considered and investigated with appropriate blood tests and imaging."
