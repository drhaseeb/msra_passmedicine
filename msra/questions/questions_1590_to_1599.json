            "This is a classic description of benign paroxysmal positional vertigo (BPPV) with fleeting episodes of vertigo lasting less than a minute triggered by specific head movements and positions, with no symptoms between episodes. BPPV can be confirmed on Dix-Hallpike manoeuvre where when performed on the affected side, symptoms will be triggered and rotational nystagmus towards the same side will be seen. Therefore rotatory nystagmus when vertigo is triggered (by Dix-Hallpike) is the sign most in keeping with this diagnosis.",
            "Fluctuating sensorineural hearing loss is classical of Meniere's disease and affects low-to-medium frequencies. This can be confirmed on audiometry but clearly has to be when the hearing loss is present. The pathophysiology of this is thought to be related to increase in the fluid levels of the inner ear (endolymphatic hydrops), which increases the pressure and therefore the stiffness within the cochlear. This disproportionately affects the low frequency end as lower stiffness is needed at this end to transmit the sounds. <br /><br />The description of the symptoms in this case suggest Meniere's with aural fullness, roaring tinnitus, fluctuating hearing loss and episodes of vertigo lasting several hours, pointing towards this diagnosis.",
            "This is testing your knowledge of the findings of the HINTS (Head Impulse, Nystagmus, Test of Skew) exam. In someone with active vertigo symptoms, a normal head impluse test suggests that the vestibulo-occular reflex is functioning normally, pointing away from a peripheral cause which would show disruption of this reflex. Bilateral nystagmus is also associated with a central rather than peripheral source of vertigo, as a peripheral cause would be unlikely to affect both sides simultaneously. Centrally one lesion can affect both sides due to the connections of the neural pathways. The presence of vertical skew is also suggestive of a central cause, indicating disruption of the prenuclear vestibular pathway.<br /><br />Therefore in a patient such as the one described with risk factors for stroke with ongoing sudden onset vertigo, these findings on the HINTS exam confirm our concern that the diagnosis is an ongoing stroke."

Vaccination during a current febrile illness is generally avoided due to the risk of exacerbating symptoms or confusing the diagnosis of the current illness. It's not that vaccines are harmful in this context, but rather it's more about medical prudence and patient comfort.

Adding a vaccine into the mix could potentially overwhelm the immune system.<br /><br />The option <b>Splenectomy in past</b> is incorrect because individuals who have had a splenectomy are at increased risk of infections, especially those caused by encapsulated bacteria such as <i>Streptococcus pneumoniae</i>, which causes pneumococcal disease. Therefore, pneumococcal vaccination is strongly recommended for these individuals, rather than being contraindicated.<br /><br /><b>Allergy to egg protein (no features of anaphylaxis)</b> is also not a contraindication for pneumococcal vaccine.
