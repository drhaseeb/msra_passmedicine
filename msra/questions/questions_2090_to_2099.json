            "The correct answer is <b>Epilepsy</b>. Bupropion, an atypical antidepressant used for smoking cessation, lowers the seizure threshold and hence is contraindicated in patients with epilepsy. The use of bupropion in these patients could potentially trigger a seizure episode.<br /><br /><b>History of supraventricular tachycardia</b> does not contraindicate the prescription of bupropion. While it's true that bupropion can cause tachycardia as a side effect, this usually happens at higher doses and is not common.

However, each patient's case should be evaluated individually considering all potential risks and benefits.<br /><br />Similarly, <b>Depression</b> does not contraindicate the prescription of bupropion either.

        "body": "NICE released guidance in 2008 on the management of smoking cessation. General points include:<br /><ul><li>patients should be offered nicotine replacement therapy (NRT), varenicline or bupropion - NICE state that clinicians should not favour one medication over another</li><li>NRT, varenicline or bupropion should normally be prescribed as part of a commitment to stop smoking on or before a particular date (target stop date)</li><li>prescription of NRT, varenicline or bupropion should be sufficient to last only until 2 weeks after the target stop date. Normally, this will be after 2 weeks of NRT therapy, and 3-4 weeks for varenicline and bupropion, to allow for the different methods of administration and mode of action. Further prescriptions should be given only to people who have demonstrated that their quit attempt is continuing</li><li>if unsuccessful using NRT, varenicline or bupropion, do not offer a repeat prescription within 6 months unless special circumstances have intervened</li><li>do not offer NRT, varenicline or bupropion in any combination</li></ul><br />Nicotine replacement therapy<br /><ul><li>adverse effects include nausea & vomiting, headaches and flu-like symptoms</li><li>NICE recommend offering a combination of nicotine patches and another form of NRT (such as gum, inhalator, lozenge or nasal spray) to people who show a high level of dependence on nicotine or who have found single forms of NRT inadequate in the past</li></ul><br />Varenicline<br /><ul><li>a nicotinic receptor partial agonist</li><li>should be started 1 week before the patients target date to stop</li><li>the recommended course of treatment is 12 weeks (but patients should be monitored regularly and treatment only continued if not smoking)</li><li>has been shown in studies to be more effective than bupropion</li><li>nausea is the most common adverse effect. Other common problems include headache, insomnia, abnormal dreams</li><li>varenicline should be used with caution in patients with a history of depression or self-harm. There are ongoing studies looking at the risk of suicidal behaviour in patients taking varenicline</li><li>contraindicated in pregnancy and breastfeeding</li></ul><br />Bupropion<br /><ul><li><span class=\"concept\" data-cid=\"12264\">a norepinephrine-dopamine reuptake inhibitor and nicotinic antagonist</span><ul><li>unlike many antidepressants it has a minimal effect on serotonin</li></ul></li><li>should be started 1 to 2 weeks before the patient's target date to stop</li><li><span class=\"concept\" data-cid=\"1699\">small risk of seizures (1 in 1,000)</span></li><li>contraindicated in <span class=\"concept\" data-cid=\"1699\">epilepsy</span>, pregnancy and breast feeding.

All women who smoke, or have stopped smoking within the last 2 weeks, or those with a CO reading of 7 ppm or above should be referred to NHS Stop Smoking Services.<br /><br />Interventions<br /><ul><li>the first-line interventions in pregnancy should be cognitive behaviour therapy, motivational interviewing or structured self-help and support from NHS Stop Smoking Services</li><li>the evidence for the use of <span class=\"concept\" data-cid=\"11172\">NRT</span> in pregnancy is mixed but it is often used if the above measures failure.

        "body": "Patients are at risk of a number of immediate, early and late complications following a myocardial infarction (MI).<br /><br /><h5 class='notes-heading'>Cardiac arrest</h5><br />This most commonly occurs due to patients developing ventricular fibrillation and is the most common cause of death following a MI. Patients are managed as per the ALS protocol with defibrillation.<br /><br /><h5 class='notes-heading'>Cardiogenic shock</h5><br />If a large part of the ventricular myocardium is damaged in the infarction the ejection fraction of the heart may decrease to the point that the patient develops cardiogenic shock. This is difficult to treat. Other causes of cardiogenic shock include the 'mechanical' complications such as left ventricular free wall rupture as listed below. Patients may require inotropic support and/or an intra-aortic balloon pump.<br /><br /><h5 class='notes-heading'>Chronic heart failure</h5><br />As described above, if the patient survives the acute phase their ventricular myocardium may be dysfunctional resulting in chronic heart failure. Loop diuretics such as furosemide will decrease fluid overload. Both ACE-inhibitors and beta-blockers have been shown to improve the long-term prognosis of patients with chronic heart failure.<br /><br /><h5 class='notes-heading'>Tachyarrhythmias</h5><br /><span class=\"concept\" data-cid=\"6891\">Ventricular fibrillation</span>, as mentioned above, is the most common cause of death following a MI. Other common arrhythmias including ventricular tachycardia.<br /><br /><h5 class='notes-heading'>Bradyarrhythmias</h5><br />Atrioventricular block is more common following <span class=\"concept\" data-cid=\"7726\">inferior myocardial infarctions</span>.<br /><br /><h5 class='notes-heading'>Pericarditis</h5><br /><span class=\"concept\" data-cid=\"4052\">Pericarditis in the first 48 hours following a transmural MI is common</span> (c. 10% of patients). The pain is typical for pericarditis (worse on lying flat etc), a pericardial rub may be heard and a pericardial effusion may be demonstrated with an echocardiogram.<br /><br /><span class=\"concept\" data-cid=\"6892\">Dressler's syndrome</span> tends to occur around <span class=\"concept\" data-cid=\"1868\">2-6 weeks</span> following a MI. The underlying pathophysiology is thought to be an autoimmune reaction against antigenic proteins formed as the myocardium recovers. It is characterised by a combination of <span class=\"concept\" data-cid=\"6897\">fever</span>, <span class=\"concept\" data-cid=\"6898\">pleuritic pain</span>, pericardial effusion and a raised ESR. It is treated with NSAIDs.<br /><br /><span class=\"concept\" data-cid=\"6893\"><h5 class='notes-heading'>Left ventricular aneurysm</h5></span><br /><br />The ischaemic damage sustained may weaken the myocardium resulting in aneurysm formation. This is typically associated with <span class=\"concept\" data-cid=\"6900\">persistent ST elevation</span> and left ventricular failure. Thrombus may form within the aneurysm increasing the risk of stroke. Patients are therefore anticoagulated.<br /><br /><div class=\"container\"><div class=\"row\"><div class=\"col-md-3\"><a href=\"https://d32xxyeh8kfs8k.cloudfront.net/images_Passmedicine/ecg095b.png\" data-fancybox=\"gallery\" data-caption=\"Left ventricular aneurysm.

Patients present with acute heart failure secondary to cardiac tamponade (<span class=\"concept\" data-cid=\"6899\">raised JVP, pulsus paradoxus</span>, diminished heart sounds). Urgent pericardiocentesis and thoracotomy are required.<br /><br /><span class=\"concept\" data-cid=\"6895\"><h5 class='notes-heading'>Ventricular septal defect</h5></span><br /><br />Rupture of the interventricular septum usually occurs in the first week and is seen in around 1-2% of patients. Features: acute heart failure associated with a pan-systolic murmur. An echocardiogram is diagnostic and will exclude acute mitral regurgitation which presents in a similar fashion. Urgent surgical correction is needed.<br /><br /><h5 class='notes-heading'>Acute mitral regurgitation</h5><br />More common with infero-posterior infarction and may be due to <span class=\"concept\" data-cid=\"5382\">ischaemia or rupture of the papillary muscle</span>. Acute hypotension and <span class=\"concept\" data-cid=\"9166\">pulmonary oedema</span> may occur. An early-to-mid systolic murmur is typically heard.

In healthy individuals, this is met by an upregulation of endogenous cortisol production via the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis.<br /><br />However, patients on long-term corticosteroid therapy may have suppression of the HPA axis and are therefore unable to mount an adequate endogenous stress response.
