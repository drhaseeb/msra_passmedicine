            "The correct answer is that <b>the pain is commonly triggered by touching the skin</b>. Trigeminal neuralgia is characterised by paroxysmal attacks of severe, lancinating pain in the distribution of one or more branches of the trigeminal nerve. The pain is typically triggered by light touch to specific areas of the face (trigger zones), such as washing, shaving, eating, or even exposure to wind. These trigger zones are commonly found around the nasolabial fold and lateral to the oral commissure.<br /><br /><b>Duloxetine is the first-line treatment</b> is incorrect. According to NICE guidelines, carbamazepine is the first-line treatment for trigeminal neuralgia. The starting dose is typically 100mg twice daily, gradually titrated up to an effective dose or maximum tolerated dose. Other anticonvulsants such as oxcarbazepine or lamotrigine may be used as second-line treatments.<br /><br /><b>All patients with suspected trigeminal neuralgia should be referred to secondary care</b> is incorrect. Initial management can be undertaken in primary care with carbamazepine. Referral to secondary care is indicated if there are atypical features, diagnostic uncertainty, inadequate response to first-line treatment, or if surgical intervention needs to be considered.<br /><br /><b>The pain is usually constant</b> is incorrect. The hallmark of trigeminal neuralgia is its paroxysmal nature, with sudden, severe attacks lasting seconds to minutes, followed by pain-free intervals. Constant pain is more suggestive of other conditions such as atypical facial pain or temporomandibular joint dysfunction.<br /><br /><b>It is bilateral in 30% of cases</b> is incorrect. Trigeminal neuralgia is typically unilateral, affecting one side of the face. Bilateral involvement occurs in only about 3-5% of cases and should raise suspicion for underlying conditions such as multiple sclerosis or other structural lesions affecting both trigeminal nerves.",

            "The correct advice is to <b>stop clopidogrel 7 days before surgery</b>. Clopidogrel is a P2Y12 receptor antagonist that irreversibly inhibits platelet aggregation for the lifespan of the platelet, which is approximately 7-10 days. To adequately restore platelet function and minimise the risk of significant peri-operative bleeding, a washout period of 7 days is recommended before elective surgery with a moderate to high bleeding risk, such as an inguinal hernia repair. In this patient, who is three years post-myocardial infarction, the risk of stent thrombosis from temporarily discontinuing clopidogrel is low, and the primary concern shifts to managing the surgical bleeding risk. Continuing his aspirin provides a baseline level of antiplatelet effect, balancing thrombotic and bleeding risks according to standard UK guidelines.<br /><br />Continuing <b>clopidogrel</b> alongside aspirin (dual antiplatelet therapy) through the peri-operative period would significantly increase the risk of bleeding and post-operative complications like haematoma formation. While this might be considered for very minor procedures or in patients with a very recent coronary stent (e.g., <3-6 months), it is not appropriate for an elective inguinal hernia repair in a patient with a stable cardiac history three years post-event.<br /><br />Stopping clopidogrel <b>24 hours before surgery</b> is an inadequate washout period. This timeframe is more relevant for medications with a shorter half-life, such as certain direct oral anticoagulants (DOACs) before low-risk procedures, or for stopping ACE inhibitors to prevent intra-operative hypotension. Due to clopidogrel's irreversible action on platelets, stopping it just one day before surgery would leave the patient with significant platelet inhibition and a high risk of bleeding.<br /><br />Stopping clopidogrel <b>48 hours before surgery</b> is also insufficient. This duration is often recommended for stopping DOACs before procedures with a higher bleeding risk. However, it does not account for the time required to replenish the circulating pool of platelets with new, functional ones after exposure to an irreversible inhibitor like clopidogrel. The risk of surgical bleeding would remain unacceptably high.<br /><br />Stopping clopidogrel <b>5 days before surgery</b> is the standard recommendation for ticagrelor, another P2Y12 inhibitor, which has a reversible binding mechanism and a shorter duration of action compared to clopidogrel. This is also the typical duration for withholding warfarin to allow the INR to normalise. Confusing the guidelines for different antithrombotic agents is a common error, but for clopidogrel, the established recommendation to ensure adequate haemostasis is a 7-day interval.",

            "<b>Propranolol</b> is the correct answer as it is the first-line treatment for essential tremor, which this patient likely has based on the clinical presentation. Essential tremor typically presents with a bilateral postural tremor of 4-12 Hz (commonly 6-8 Hz) that is worse with arm extension, and there is often a positive family history. Beta-blockers, particularly propranolol, are the most effective first-line treatment, working by blocking peripheral beta-adrenergic receptors. The typical starting dose is 20-40mg twice daily.<br /><br /><b>Amitriptyline</b> is incorrect as it is not indicated for essential tremor. While it may be used to treat other neurological conditions such as neuropathic pain or migraine prophylaxis, it can actually worsen tremor as a side effect due to its anticholinergic properties.<br /><br /><b>D-penicillamine</b> is incorrect as it is primarily used in Wilson's disease, a genetic disorder of copper metabolism. While Wilson's disease can cause tremor, the presentation would typically include other features such as liver disease, psychiatric symptoms, and Kayser-Fleischer rings. Additionally, the age of onset is usually much younger.<br /><br /><b>Levodopa</b> is incorrect as it is the primary treatment for Parkinson's disease. While parkinsonian tremor can appear similar, it is typically a 4-6 Hz rest tremor that improves with action, unlike this patient's postural tremor. The absence of other parkinsonian features (bradykinesia, rigidity) also makes Parkinson's disease unlikely.<br /><br /><b>Diazepam</b> is incorrect as while benzodiazepines can temporarily reduce tremor severity, they are not recommended as first-line treatment due to their sedating effects and risk of dependence. They may be used as an adjunct therapy in severe cases or for occasional use in specific situations where the tremor is particularly troublesome.",

            "The correct answer is <b>6 months</b>. According to the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) guidelines, it is recommended to wait at least 6 months after a myocardial infarction before prescribing a phosphodiesterase type 5 inhibitor such as sildenafil. This is because there is an increased risk of cardiovascular events in patients who have recently experienced a myocardial infarction, and phosphodiesterase type 5 inhibitors can potentially exacerbate this risk by causing systemic vasodilation and reducing blood pressure.<br /><br />The first incorrect option, <b>Can prescribe straightaway</b>, is not advised due to the aforementioned increased risk of cardiovascular events post-myocardial infarction. Prescribing sildenafil immediately could endanger the patient's health.<br /><br />The second incorrect option, <b>1 week</b>, is also too soon to safely prescribe sildenafil following a myocardial infarction. The patient's cardiovascular system needs more time to recover and stabilize before introducing medications that may affect blood pressure or vascular function.<br /><br />Similarly, waiting only <b>4 weeks</b> or <b>3 months</b> after a myocardial infarction before prescribing sildenafil would still not be in line with NICE guidelines. Although these options provide more time for recovery compared to the previous two incorrect options, they do not meet the recommended minimum waiting period of 6 months.<br /><br />In summary, it is essential to follow NICE guidelines when considering prescribing phosphodiesterase type 5 inhibitors like sildenafil for patients who have recently experienced a myocardial infarction. Waiting at least <b>6 months</b> after the event helps minimize potential risks associated with these medications and ensures safer treatment for erectile dysfunction in these patients.",

        "question": "You are considering prescribing sildenafil to a patient who complains of erectile dysfunction. He had a myocardial infarction earlier in the year but is not currently taking nitrates or nicorandil. How long do NICE recommend we wait following a myocardial infarction before prescribing a phosphodiesterase type 5 inhibitor?",
        "correct_answer": "5",
        "question_notes": "The correct answer is <b>6 months</b>. According to the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) guidelines, it is recommended to wait at least 6 months after a myocardial infarction before prescribing a phosphodiesterase type 5 inhibitor such as sildenafil. This is because there is an increased risk of cardiovascular events in patients who have recently experienced a myocardial infarction, and phosphodiesterase type 5 inhibitors can potentially exacerbate this risk by causing systemic vasodilation and reducing blood pressure.<br /><br />The first incorrect option, <b>Can prescribe straightaway</b>, is not advised due to the aforementioned increased risk of cardiovascular events post-myocardial infarction. Prescribing sildenafil immediately could endanger the patient's health.<br /><br />The second incorrect option, <b>1 week</b>, is also too soon to safely prescribe sildenafil following a myocardial infarction. The patient's cardiovascular system needs more time to recover and stabilize before introducing medications that may affect blood pressure or vascular function.<br /><br />Similarly, waiting only <b>4 weeks</b> or <b>3 months</b> after a myocardial infarction before prescribing sildenafil would still not be in line with NICE guidelines. Although these options provide more time for recovery compared to the previous two incorrect options, they do not meet the recommended minimum waiting period of 6 months.<br /><br />In summary, it is essential to follow NICE guidelines when considering prescribing phosphodiesterase type 5 inhibitors like sildenafil for patients who have recently experienced a myocardial infarction. Waiting at least <b>6 months</b> after the event helps minimize potential risks associated with these medications and ensures safer treatment for erectile dysfunction in these patients.",

        "body": "NICE produced guidelines on the management of patients following a myocardial infarction (MI) in 2013. Some key points are listed below<br /><br /><span class=\"concept\" data-cid=\"11545\">All patients should be offered the following drugs</span>:<br /><ul><li>dual antiplatelet therapy (aspirin plus a second antiplatelet agent)</li><li>ACE inhibitor </li><li>beta-blocker</li><li>statin</li></ul><br />Some selected lifestyle points:<br /><ul><li>diet: advise a Mediterranean style diet, switch butter and cheese for plant oil based products. Do not recommend omega-3 supplements or eating oily fish</li><li>exercise: advise 20-30 mins a day until patients are 'slightly breathless'</li><li><span class=\"concept\" data-cid=\"372\">sexual activity may resume 4 weeks after an uncomplicated MI</span>. Reassure patients that sex does not increase their likelihood of a further MI. PDE5 inhibitors (e.g, sildenafil) may be used 6 months after a MI. They should however be avoided in patient prescribed either nitrates or nicorandil</li></ul><br />Most patients who've had an acute coronary syndrome are now given dual antiplatelet therapy (DAPT). Clopidogrel was previously the second antiplatelet of choice. Now ticagrelor and prasugrel (also ADP-receptor inhibitors) are more widely used. NICE now recommend:<br /><ul><li>post acute coronary syndrome (medically managed): add ticagrelor to aspirin, stop ticagrelor after 12 months</li><li>post percutaneous coronary intervention: add prasugrel or ticagrelor to aspirin, stop the second antiplatelet after 12 months</li><li>this 12 month period may be altered for people at a high-risk of bleeding or those who at high-risk of further ischaemic events</li></ul><br />Aldosterone antagonists<br /><ul><li><span class=\"concept\" data-cid=\"9699\">patients who have had an acute MI and who have symptoms and/or signs of heart failure and left ventricular systolic dysfunction, treatment with an aldosterone antagonist</span> licensed for post-MI treatment (e.g. eplerenone) should be initiated within 3-14 days of the MI, preferably after ACE inhibitor therapy</li></ul>",
