        "title": "Acute kidney injury: a very basic introduction",
        "body": "Acute kidney injury (AKI), previously termed acute renal failure, describes a reduction in renal function following an insult to the kidneys. In years gone by the kidneys were very much a neglected organ in acute medicine - the recognition of decreasing renal function was often slow and action limited. Around 15% of patients admitted to hospital develop AKI. <br /><br />Whilst most patients with AKI recover their renal function there are many patients who will have long term impaired kidney function due to AKI. As well as long-term morbidity, AKI may also result in acute complications including death. Whilst exact figures are difficult to calculate NICE estimate that inpatient mortality of AKI in the UK might typically be 25-30% or more.<br /><br /><div class=\"container\"><div class=\"row\"><div class=\"col-md-3\"><a href=\"https://d32xxyeh8kfs8k.cloudfront.net/images_Passmedicine/usb092b.jpg\" data-fancybox=\"gallery\" data-caption=\"Specimen from a patient who had an acute kidney injury.

In the heart, a lack of blood flow (ischaemia) to the myocardium causes a myocardial infarction. In a similar fashion, 85% of strokes are caused by ischaemia to the brain. The same goes for the kidneys. One of the major causes of AKI is ischaemia, or lack of blood flowing to the kidneys. <br /><br />Examples<br /><ul><li>hypovolaemia secondary to diarrhoea/vomiting</li><li>renal artery stenosis</li></ul><br /><h5 class='notes-heading'>Intrinsic</h5><br />The second group of causes relate to intrinsic damage to the glomeruli, renal tubules or interstitium of the kidneys themselves. This may be due to toxins (drugs, contrast etc) or immune-mediated glomuleronephritis.<br /><br />Examples<br /><ul><li>glomerulonephritis</li><li>acute tubular necrosis (ATN)</li><li>acute interstitial nephritis (AIN), respectively</li><li>rhabdomyolysis</li><li>tumour lysis syndrome</li></ul><br /><h5 class='notes-heading'>Postrenal</h5><br />The third group relates to problems after the kidneys. This is where there is an obstruction to the urine coming from the kidneys resulting in things 'backing-up' and affecting the normal renal function. An example could be a unilateral ureteric stone or bilateral hydroneprosis secondary to acute urinary retention caused by benign prostatic hyperplasia.<br /><br />Examples<br /><ul><li>kidney stone in ureter or bladder</li><li>benign prostatic hyperplasia</li><li>external compression of the ureter</li></ul><br /><div class=\"container\"><div class=\"row\"><div class=\"col-md-3\"><a href=\"https://d32xxyeh8kfs8k.cloudfront.net/images_Passmedicine/usb093b.jpg\" data-fancybox=\"gallery\" data-caption=\"This patient had an invasive papillary tumour of the distal left ureter, indicated by the arrow. This resulted in the ureter becoming blocked, resulting in a left hydroureter and hydronephrosis.

NICE support this approach and have published guidelines suggesting which patients are at greater risk. <br /><br />Risk factors for AKI include:<br /><ul><li>chronic kidney disease</li><li>other organ failure/chronic disease e.g. heart failure, liver disease, diabetes mellitus</li><li>history of acute kidney injury</li><li>use of drugs with nephrotoxic potential (e.g. <span class=\"concept\" data-cid=\"6907\">NSAIDs</span>, <span class=\"concept\" data-cid=\"6908\">aminoglycosides</span>, <span class=\"concept\" data-cid=\"6909\">ACE inhibitors</span>, <span class=\"concept\" data-cid=\"6910\">angiotensin II receptor antagonists</span> [ARBs] and <span class=\"concept\" data-cid=\"6911\">diuretics</span>) within the past week</li><li>use of iodinated contrast agents within the past week</li><li>age 65 years or over</li></ul>oliguria (urine output less than 0.5 ml/kg/hour)<br /><ul><li>neurological or cognitive impairment or disability, which may mean limited access to fluids because of reliance on a carer</li></ul><br /><br /><h5 class='notes-heading'>Preventing AKI</h5><br />By identifying patients at increased risk of AKI (see above) it may be possible to take steps to reduce the risk. For example, patients who are at risk of AKI and who are undergoing an investigation requiring contrast are usually given IV fluids to reduce the risk. Certain drugs such as ACE inhibitors and ARBs may also be temporarily stopped.<br /><br /><br /><h5 class='notes-heading'>What happens when kidneys stop working?</h5><br />It's best to work backwards and think about what kidneys actually do. The kidneys are primarily responsible for fluid balance and maintaining homeostasis. Therefore two of the key ways AKI may be detected are:<br /><ul><li>a reduced urine output. This is termed oliguria and is defined as a <span class=\"concept\" data-cid=\"1964\">urine output of less than 0.5 ml/kg/hour</span></li><li>fluid overload</li><li>a rise in molecules that the kidney normal excretes/maintains a careful balance of. Examples include potassium, urea and creatinine</li></ul><br /><br /><h5 class='notes-heading'>Symptoms and signs</h5><br />Many patients with early AKI may experience no symptoms. However, as renal failure progresses the following may be seen:<br /><ul><li>reduced urine output</li><li>pulmonary and peripheral oedema</li><li>arrhythmias (secondary to changes in potassium and acid-base balance)</li><li>features of uraemia (for example, pericarditis or encephalopathy)</li></ul><br /><br /><h5 class='notes-heading'>Detection</h5><br />One of the most common blood tests performed on the wards is 'urea and electrolytes' or 'U&Es'. This returns a number of markers, including<br /><ul><li>sodium</li><li>potassium</li><li>urea</li><li>creatinine</li></ul><br />NICE recommend that we can use a variety of different criteria to make an official diagnosis of AKI. They state:<br /><br /><div class='bs-callout bs-callout-default'><i><i><br />Detect acute kidney injury, in line with the (p)RIFLE, AKIN or KDIGO definitions, by using any of the following criteria:<br /><ul><li>a rise in serum creatinine of 26 micromol/litre or greater within 48 hours</li><li>a 50% or greater rise in serum creatinine known or presumed to have occurred within the past 7 days</li><li>a fall in urine output to <span class=\"concept\" data-cid=\"1964\">less than 0.5 ml/kg/hour</span> for more than 6 hours in adults and more than </li></ul></i></i></div><br />Urinalysis<br /><ul><li>all patients with suspected AKI should have urinalysis</li></ul><br />Imaging<br /><ul><li>if patients have no identifiable cause for the deterioration or are at risk of urinary tract obstruction they should have a <b>renal ultrasound</b> within 24 hours of assessment.</li></ul><br /><br /><h5 class='notes-heading'>Management</h5><br />The management of AKI is largely supportive. This means patients require careful fluid balance to ensure that the kidneys are properly perfused but not excessively to avoid fluid overload. It is also important to <span class=\"concept\" data-cid=\"4196\"> review a patient's medication list</span> to see what treatments may either be exacerbating their renal dysfunction or may be dangerous as a consequence of renal dysfunction. The table below gives some examples of common drugs:<br /><br /><div class=\"table-responsive\"><table class = \"tlarge table table-striped table-bordered\"  data-role=\"table\" id=\"tableid1\" ><thead><tr><th>Usually safe to continue in AKI</th><th>Should be stopped in AKI as may worsen renal function</th><th>May have to be stopped in AKI as increased risk of toxicity (but doesn't usually worsen AKI itself)</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>&#8226; <span class=\"concept\" data-cid=\"6901\">Paracetamol</span><br />&#8226; <span class=\"concept\" data-cid=\"6902\">Warfarin</span> <br />&#8226; <span class=\"concept\" data-cid=\"6903\">Statins</span><br />&#8226; <span class=\"concept\" data-cid=\"6904\">Aspirin (at a cardioprotective dose of 75mg od)</span><br />&#8226; <span class=\"concept\" data-cid=\"6905\">Clopidogrel</span><br />&#8226; <span class=\"concept\" data-cid=\"6906\">Beta-blockers</span></td><td>&#8226; <span class=\"concept\" data-cid=\"6907\">NSAIDs</span> (<span class=\"concept\" data-cid=\"2070\">except if aspirin at cardiac dose e.g. 75mg od</span>)<br />&#8226; <span class=\"concept\" data-cid=\"6908\">Aminoglycosides</span><br />&#8226; <span class=\"concept\" data-cid=\"6909\">ACE inhibitors</span><br />&#8226; <span class=\"concept\" data-cid=\"6910\">Angiotensin II receptor antagonists</span><br />&#8226; <span class=\"concept\" data-cid=\"6911\">Diuretics</span><br /></td><td>&#8226; <span class=\"concept\" data-cid=\"6912\">Metformin</span><br />&#8226; <span class=\"concept\" data-cid=\"6913\">Lithium</span><br />&#8226; <span class=\"concept\" data-cid=\"6914\">Digoxin</span></td></tr></tbody></table></div><br />Treatments which are <b>not recommend</b> include the routine use of loop diuretics (to artificially boost urine output) and low-dose dopamine (in an attempt to increase renal perfusion). There is however a role for loop diuretics in patients who experience significant fluid overload.<br /><br />Hyperkalaemia also needs prompt treatment to avoid arrhythmias which may potentially be life-threatening.

            "The correct answer is <b>Irregular menstrual bleeding</b>. The Nexplanon implant, which contains the progestin etonogestrel, mainly functions by inhibiting ovulation. However, it also alters the endometrium and cervical mucus, which can lead to changes in menstrual bleeding patterns. According to UK guidelines, up to 1 in 5 women may experience amenorrhoea after a year of use, while others may have frequent or prolonged bleeding. Therefore, it's crucial to counsel patients about this potential side effect before insertion.<br /><br />The option <b>Increased risk of cervical cancer</b> is incorrect. While high-risk human papillomavirus (HPV) infection is a well-established risk factor for cervical cancer, there's no evidence linking progestin-only contraceptives like Nexplanon with an increased risk of cervical cancer.<br /><br />Similarly, the option <b>Increased risk of venous thromboembolism</b> is not accurate.

        "question": "A 34-year-old female presents to a Family Planning clinic. She is interested in having a Nexplanon inserted. What is the main adverse effect she should be counselled about?",
        "correct_answer": "3",
        "question_notes": "The correct answer is <b>Irregular menstrual bleeding</b>. The Nexplanon implant, which contains the progestin etonogestrel, mainly functions by inhibiting ovulation. However, it also alters the endometrium and cervical mucus, which can lead to changes in menstrual bleeding patterns. According to UK guidelines, up to 1 in 5 women may experience amenorrhoea after a year of use, while others may have frequent or prolonged bleeding. Therefore, it's crucial to counsel patients about this potential side effect before insertion.<br /><br />The option <b>Increased risk of cervical cancer</b> is incorrect. While high-risk human papillomavirus (HPV) infection is a well-established risk factor for cervical cancer, there's no evidence linking progestin-only contraceptives like Nexplanon with an increased risk of cervical cancer.<br /><br />Similarly, the option <b>Increased risk of venous thromboembolism</b> is not accurate. Combined hormonal contraceptives (containing both estrogen and progesterone) are known to increase the risk of venous thromboembolism due to their influence on coagulation factors. However, progestin-only methods such as Nexplanon do not carry this increased risk.<br /><br />The claim of an <b>Increased risk of stroke</b> is also incorrect for Nexplanon users.

            "<b>Amoxicillin</b> is the correct answer. This patient has clinical features consistent with community-acquired pneumonia and a CRB65 score of 0 (no confusion, respiratory rate <30/min, blood pressure adequate, age <65 years). According to NICE guidelines, patients with a CRB65 score of 0 have a low risk of mortality (<1%) and can be considered for home-based treatment. For low-severity community-acquired pneumonia, amoxicillin monotherapy is the first-line antibiotic choice. NICE recommends a 5-day course for patients with low-severity disease. This approach balances effective treatment with antimicrobial stewardship principles, avoiding unnecessary broad-spectrum or dual antibiotic therapy when clinical severity does not warrant it.<br /><br /><b>Amoxicillin and clarithromycin</b> represents dual antibiotic therapy, which is recommended for moderate to high-severity community-acquired pneumonia. This patient's CRB65 score of 0 indicates low severity disease, making dual therapy unnecessarily broad-spectrum. NICE guidelines reserve this combination for patients with CURB65 scores of 2 or more in hospital settings, or those with moderate-severity pneumonia requiring hospital assessment. Using dual therapy in low-severity cases contributes to antimicrobial resistance without providing additional clinical benefit.<br /><br /><b>Clarithromycin</b> monotherapy would be appropriate if this patient had a documented penicillin allergy. However, there is no mention of allergy in the scenario, and amoxicillin remains superior first-line therapy when tolerated. Macrolides are recommended as alternatives in penicillin-allergic patients, but should not be used preferentially over amoxicillin in patients who can tolerate penicillins, as this would represent suboptimal antimicrobial stewardship.<br /><br /><b>Co-amoxiclav</b> is a beta-lactamase stable penicillin that NICE recommends considering in high-severity community-acquired pneumonia (CURB65 \u22653), typically alongside a macrolide. This patient has low-severity disease and does not require such broad-spectrum coverage. Co-amoxiclav would be unnecessarily broad for this clinical presentation and increases the risk of adverse effects including Clostridioides difficile infection.<br /><br /><b>Doxycycline</b> is an alternative antibiotic for patients with penicillin allergy, alongside macrolides. Like clarithromycin, it should not be used as first-line therapy when amoxicillin can be given. Tetracyclines are effective against typical and atypical organisms causing pneumonia, but amoxicillin remains the preferred first-line agent in non-allergic patients with low-severity community-acquired pneumonia according to UK guidelines.",
