        "body": "Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is now the most common cause of liver disease in the developed world. It is largely caused by obesity and describes a spectrum of disease ranging from:<br /><ul><li>steatosis - fat in the liver</li><li>steatohepatitis - fat with inflammation, non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH), see below</li><li>progressive disease may cause fibrosis and liver cirrhosis</li></ul><br />NAFLD is thought to represent the hepatic manifestation of the metabolic syndrome and hence <span class=\"concept\" data-cid=\"721\">insulin resistance</span> is thought to be the key mechanism leading to steatosis.<br /><br />Non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) is a term used to describe liver changes similar to those seen in alcoholic hepatitis in the absence of a history of alcohol abuse. It is relatively common and thought to affect around 3-4% of the general population. The progression of disease in patients with NASH may be responsible for a proportion of patients previously labelled as cryptogenic cirrhosis.<br /><br />Associated factors<br /><ul><li><span class=\"concept\" data-cid=\"11101\">obesity</span></li><li><span class=\"concept\" data-cid=\"721\">type 2 diabetes mellitus</span></li><li>hyperlipidaemia</li><li>jejunoileal bypass</li><li><span class=\"concept\" data-cid=\"4462\">sudden weight loss/starvation</span></li></ul><br />Features<br /><ul><li>usually asymptomatic</li><li>hepatomegaly</li><li><span class=\"concept\" data-cid=\"3981\">ALT is typically greater than AST</span></li><li>increased echogenicity on ultrasound</li></ul><br />NICE produced guidelines on the investigation and management of NAFLD in 2016. Key points:<br /><ul><li>there is no evidence to support screening for NAFLD in adults, even in at risk groups (e.g. type 2 diabetes)</li><li>the guidelines are therefore based on the management of the <i>incidental</i> finding of NAFLD - typically asymptomatic fatty changes on liver ultrasound</li><li>in these patients, NICE recommends the use of the <span class=\"concept\" data-cid=\"8322\">enhanced liver fibrosis (ELF)</span> blood test to check for advanced fibrosis</li><li>the ELF blood test is a combination of hyaluronic acid + procollagen III + tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinase 1. An algorithm based on these values results in an ELF blood test score, similar to triple testing for Down's syndrome</li></ul><br />An excellent review by Byrne et Al<sup>1</sup> in 2018 reviewed the diagnosis and monitoring of NAFLD. It made the following suggestions if the ELF blood test was not available:<br /><ul><li>non-invasive tests may be used to assess the severity of fibrosis</li><li>these include the FIB4 score or NALFD fibrosis score</li><li>these scores may be used in combination with a FibroScan (liver stiffness measurement assessed with transient elastography)</li><li>this combination has been shown to have excellent accuracy in predicting fibrosis</li></ul><br />Patients who are likely to have advanced fibrosis should be referred to a liver specialist. They will then likely have a liver biopsy to stage the disease more accurately.<br /><br />Management<br /><ul><li>the mainstay of treatment is lifestyle changes (particularly <span class=\"concept\" data-cid=\"3604\">weight loss</span>) and monitoring</li><li>there is ongoing research into the role of gastric banding and insulin-sensitising drugs (e.g. metformin, <span class=\"concept\" data-cid=\"1538\">pioglitazone</span>)</li></ul><br /><b>References</b><br />1.

            "The correct answer is <b>Functional hyposplenism</b>. Patients with coeliac disease require regular immunisations due to functional hyposplenism. The spleen plays a crucial role in the immune system, particularly in filtering bacteria and producing antibodies. In patients with coeliac disease, there can be a decrease in splenic function, which increases their susceptibility to certain infections, especially those caused by encapsulated bacteria such as Streptococcus pneumoniae, Haemophilus influenzae type b, and Neisseria meningitidis. Therefore, it is essential for these patients to receive regular immunisations against these organisms.<br /><br />The option <b>Reduced absorption of proteins leads to hypogammaglobulinaemia</b> is incorrect because although malabsorption can occur in untreated coeliac disease, it does not typically result in hypogammaglobulinaemia. Furthermore, the patient's coeliac disease is well controlled in this scenario.<br /><br />The option <b>Reduced absorption of iron, vitamin B12 and folate impairs normal immunological function</b> is incorrect because while deficiencies of these nutrients can lead to anaemia and other complications, they do not directly impair the immune system's ability to fight off infections.<br /><br />The option <b>Higher incidence of T-cell dysfunction in patients with coeliac disease</b> is incorrect because although there may be some alterations in T-cell function related to gluten sensitivity and inflammation in the gut mucosa of patients with coeliac disease, this does not necessarily translate into an increased risk of infections requiring immunisation.<br /><br />Finally, the option <b>Up to 15% of patients with coeliac disease have mild primary immunodeficiencies</b> is also incorrect because there is no robust evidence supporting an increased prevalence of primary immunodeficiencies among individuals with coeliac disease compared to the general population.",

According to the Faculty of Sexual and Reproductive Healthcare (FSRH) guidelines in the UK, if a Nexplanon (etonogestrel implant) is inserted between day 1-5 of a woman's menstrual cycle, it will be effective immediately. However, if it is inserted at any other time in her cycle, it will not be effective until after 7 days. Therefore, additional contraception should be used during this period.<br /><br /><b>After 2 days</b> is incorrect as it does not allow sufficient time for the etonogestrel to reach therapeutic levels in the body and provide reliable contraception. <br /><br /><b>At the end of the next menstrual period</b> is also incorrect. This option assumes that ovulation and therefore fertility resumes immediately after menstruation ends which is not accurate. Furthermore, waiting until the end of next menstrual period would unnecessarily prolong unprotected sexual intercourse.<br /><br />The option <b>Immediately</b> would only have been correct if the Nexplanon was inserted within the first five days of her menstrual cycle. As stated previously, since this patient had her Nexplanon inserted on day 18 of her cycle, she cannot rely on immediate contraceptive protection.<br /><br />The final option <b>At the start of the next menstrual period</b> is incorrect because it suggests that contraceptive protection begins with menstruation which isn't accurate.

The two main differences are:<br /><ul><li>the applicator has been redesigned to try and prevent 'deep' insertions (i.e. subcutaneous/intramuscular)</li><li>it is radiopaque and therefore easier to locate if impalpable</li></ul><br />Both versions slowly releases the progestogen hormone etonogestrel.
