            "<b>Aseptic loosening</b> is the correct diagnosis in this case. This patient presents with gradually worsening pain in the hip 8 years after total hip replacement, which is a typical timeframe for aseptic loosening to develop. The pain is mechanical in nature (worse on weight-bearing), and she has developed a limp, suggesting altered biomechanics. The radiographic finding of radiolucent lines at the bone-cement interface is pathognomonic for aseptic loosening, representing the separation between the prosthesis and the bone. Aseptic loosening is the most common reason for revision of total hip replacements, accounting for approximately 55-70% of all revisions. It occurs due to wear particles from the prosthesis triggering an inflammatory response that leads to osteolysis and subsequent loosening of the implant components.<br /><br /><b>Prosthetic joint infection</b> typically presents with more acute symptoms including erythema, warmth, fever, and elevated inflammatory markers. While late infections can occur years after surgery and present more indolently, the absence of systemic symptoms or fever makes infection less likely in this case. Prosthetic joint infections often cause pain at rest as well as with movement, unlike the predominantly weight-bearing pain described here.<br /><br /><b>Periprosthetic fracture</b> usually occurs following trauma, which is absent in this patient's history. These fractures typically present with acute onset pain, inability to weight-bear, and visible fracture lines on radiography, none of which are described in this scenario. The gradual onset of symptoms over 6 months is inconsistent with a fracture.<br /><br /><b>Recurrent osteoarthritis</b> is not an appropriate diagnosis as osteoarthritis cannot recur in a replaced joint where the native articular cartilage has been removed. The patient's symptoms are related to the prosthesis rather than degenerative joint disease.<br /><br /><b>Prosthetic dislocation</b> presents acutely with sudden pain and inability to bear weight following a specific movement, typically involving flexion, adduction, and internal rotation of the hip. On examination, the leg would appear shortened and internally rotated. The gradual onset of symptoms and normal leg position make dislocation highly unlikely in this case.",

            "The correct answer is <b>Acute sickle chest syndrome</b>. This condition is a severe complication of sickle cell anaemia, characterised by the presence of new pulmonary infiltrates on chest x-ray, accompanied by symptoms such as fever, cough, sputum production, dyspnoea or hypoxia. The patient's history of sickle cell anaemia, presenting symptoms and radiological findings are all indicative of this diagnosis. <br /><br /><b>Myocardial infarction</b> is less likely in this case. While chest pain could be suggestive of myocardial infarction (MI), the patient's age and lack of other risk factors make it less probable. Additionally, the bilateral infiltrates seen on chest x-ray are not typical for MI.<br /><br />The option <b>Haemolytic crisis</b> refers to an accelerated rate of red blood cell destruction leading to symptoms such as fatigue, pallor and jaundice. Although patients with sickle cell disease can experience haemolytic crises, the presented respiratory symptoms and radiological findings do not support this diagnosis.<br /><br /><b>Thrombotic crisis</b>, another complication associated with sickle cell anaemia, typically presents with painful swelling in one or more extremities due to vaso-occlusive events. However, these events usually don't result in shortness of breath or bilateral basal infiltrates on chest x-ray.<br /><br />Lastly, while a <b>Pulmonary embolism</b> could potentially present with similar symptoms (shortness of breath and chest pain), it would not typically cause the bilateral basal infiltrates seen on the chest x-ray in this case.",

        "correct_answer": "4",
        "question_notes": "The correct answer is <b>Acute sickle chest syndrome</b>. This condition is a severe complication of sickle cell anaemia, characterised by the presence of new pulmonary infiltrates on chest x-ray, accompanied by symptoms such as fever, cough, sputum production, dyspnoea or hypoxia. The patient's history of sickle cell anaemia, presenting symptoms and radiological findings are all indicative of this diagnosis. <br /><br /><b>Myocardial infarction</b> is less likely in this case. While chest pain could be suggestive of myocardial infarction (MI), the patient's age and lack of other risk factors make it less probable. Additionally, the bilateral infiltrates seen on chest x-ray are not typical for MI.<br /><br />The option <b>Haemolytic crisis</b> refers to an accelerated rate of red blood cell destruction leading to symptoms such as fatigue, pallor and jaundice. Although patients with sickle cell disease can experience haemolytic crises, the presented respiratory symptoms and radiological findings do not support this diagnosis.<br /><br /><b>Thrombotic crisis</b>, another complication associated with sickle cell anaemia, typically presents with painful swelling in one or more extremities due to vaso-occlusive events. However, these events usually don't result in shortness of breath or bilateral basal infiltrates on chest x-ray.<br /><br />Lastly, while a <b>Pulmonary embolism</b> could potentially present with similar symptoms (shortness of breath and chest pain), it would not typically cause the bilateral basal infiltrates seen on the chest x-ray in this case.",

            "The correct answer is osteosarcoma, this is the most common primary malignant bone tumour in children and adolescents which commonly affects the metaphyseal region of long bones. Radiographs classically show Codman triangle (a triangular area of new subperiosteal bone) with an associated sunburst appearance. The family history is significant as osteosarcoma is associated with the retinoblastoma gene. <br /><br />Chondrosarcoma is incorrect. This is a malignant tumour of cartilage, which most commonly affects the axial skeleton and not the diaphysis of long bones. This type of tumour is also more common in middle-age. <br /><br />Ewing's sarcoma is incorrect as this is likely to show an 'onion skin' appearance on x-ray. For reference, this also shows the presence of EWS-FLI1 protein on fine-needle aspiration of the tumour. <br /><br />Giant cell tumour is incorrect. This is a benign tumour of multinucleated giant cells which occurs most frequently in the epiphyses of long bones and shows a 'double-bubble' or 'soap bubble' appearance on x-ray. This diagnosis is also less likely as giant cell tumours are more commonly seen in patients aged 20-40 years old. <br /><br />Osteochondroma is incorrect. This is the most common benign bone tumour and while it is most in males aged under 20 years old, it often presents with cartilage-capped bony projection on the external surface of a bone and is therefore unlikely given the presentation.",

            "The correct answer is <b>Ceftriaxone</b>. Ceftriaxone is a third-generation cephalosporin antibiotic which is considered safe for use in breastfeeding mothers according to the British National Formulary (BNF). It has a low oral bioavailability, and therefore minimal amounts would be absorbed by the infant through breast milk. <br /><br /><b>Tetracycline</b> and <b>Doxycycline</b> are both part of the tetracycline class of antibiotics. They are contra-indicated during breastfeeding because they bind to calcium in the infant's system, leading to possible dental staining, enamel hypoplasia, inhibition of bone growth in preterm infants, and potential photosensitivity reactions. In addition, these drugs can also affect the gastrointestinal flora of the infant causing diarrhoea or thrush.<br /><br /><b>Ciprofloxacin</b> is a fluoroquinolone antibiotic that is generally avoided during breastfeeding due to its potential to cause arthropathy in juvenile animals as seen in animal studies. Although this has not been definitively proven in humans, it is advisable to avoid this drug when breastfeeding unless absolutely necessary.<br /><br /><b>Chloramphenicol</b>, an amphenicol antibiotic, is also contra-indicated during breastfeeding as per UK guidelines. It has been associated with 'grey baby syndrome', characterised by cardiovascular collapse, cyanosis and death due to immature liver enzymes in neonates and young infants which are unable to metabolise and excrete chloramphenicol effectively.
