            "<b>Anti-voltage gated calcium channel antibodies</b> is the correct answer. This patient presents with classical features of Lambert-Eaton myasthenic syndrome (LEMS): proximal muscle weakness that improves with repeated effort (post-tetanic potentiation), and diminished reflexes that may return with repeated testing. The key diagnostic clue is the improvement in strength after initial exertion, which distinguishes LEMS from myasthenia gravis where weakness worsens with repeated use. LEMS is caused by antibodies against pre-synaptic voltage-gated calcium channels at the neuromuscular junction. Approximately 50-60% of LEMS cases are paraneoplastic, most commonly associated with small cell lung cancer. Testing for these antibodies is the most specific investigation and should prompt screening for underlying malignancy, particularly chest imaging. Given this patient's age and smoking demographics (implied by the clinical context), identifying LEMS could lead to early detection of small cell lung cancer.<br /><br /><b>Acetylcholine receptor antibodies</b> are found in myasthenia gravis, which presents with fatigable weakness that worsens with repeated use rather than improves. Patients typically have ocular symptoms (ptosis, diplopia) and bulbar weakness. The pattern of weakness improving with exertion makes myasthenia gravis unlikely in this case.<br /><br /><b>Creatine kinase</b> would be elevated in inflammatory myopathies such as polymyositis or dermatomyositis, which cause progressive proximal weakness. However, these conditions do not demonstrate the characteristic post-tetanic potentiation seen here, and weakness would not improve with repeated testing. CK is a useful screening test for muscle damage but would not explain the clinical pattern observed.<br /><br /><b>Electromyography with repetitive nerve stimulation</b> would indeed show characteristic findings in LEMS (incremental response with high-frequency stimulation), making it a useful diagnostic test. However, serological testing for anti-voltage gated calcium channel antibodies is more specific and readily available, making it the most appropriate initial investigation when LEMS is suspected clinically.<br /><br /><b>MRI lumbosacral spine</b> might be considered if radiculopathy or cauda equina syndrome were suspected. However, these conditions would typically present with dermatomal patterns of weakness, sensory changes, and would not demonstrate the improvement with repeated effort that characterises this neuromuscular junction disorder.",

Chlamydia can also cause cervical excitation which this lady does not have.<br /><br />Herpes simplex doesn't tend to cause vaginal discharge, and would instead present as a crop of ulcers or tingling type sensations around the vulva. Patients can have a flu-like illness, and may have some lymphadenopathy.<br /><br />For candidiasis, or thrush, you would expect a lot more itching in the history. It would also be more likely to have a thick creamy consistency like cottage cheese. There is a higher probability with thrush that you would get vulval irritation. <br /><br />Bacterial vaginosis is the most likely diagnosis on balance.

            "<b>High-dose proton pump inhibitor and endoscopic surveillance in 3-5 years</b> is the correct management plan. This patient has a diagnosis of non-dysplastic Barrett's oesophagus, which is intestinal metaplasia of the distal oesophagus. According to the British Society of Gastroenterology (BSG) guidelines, management has two key components. Firstly, all patients with Barrett's oesophagus should be treated with a proton pump inhibitor (PPI) to control symptoms of reflux and reduce acid exposure to the oesophagus. While the evidence that this prevents progression to cancer is not definitive, it is thought to reduce inflammation and is standard practice; a high dose is typically recommended. Secondly, surveillance endoscopy is required to monitor for the development of dysplasia, which is a precursor to adenocarcinoma. For patients with non-dysplastic Barrett's oesophagus, the risk of progression is low (approximately 0.3% per year). Therefore, the recommended surveillance interval is every 3-5 years. This strategy balances the risk of progression against the risks and costs of repeated endoscopy.<br /><br /><b>Annual endoscopic surveillance</b> is incorrect. This surveillance interval is more intensive than required for this patient's level of risk. Annual surveillance is generally reserved for patients who have been diagnosed with low-grade dysplasia on histology. In such cases, the risk of progression to high-grade dysplasia or cancer is significantly higher, justifying more frequent monitoring. Subjecting a patient with non-dysplastic Barrett's to annual endoscopy would expose them to unnecessary procedural risks (e.g., perforation, bleeding, complications of sedation) and is not a cost-effective use of healthcare resources. The BSG guidelines are clear that a 3-5 year interval is appropriate for patients with no dysplasia.<br /><br /><b>Continue current medication and discharge</b> is inappropriate. Barrett's oesophagus is a known pre-malignant condition, increasing the risk of developing oesophageal adenocarcinoma by 30-40 times compared to the general population. Although the absolute annual risk is small, it is significant enough to warrant long-term follow-up. Discharging the patient would mean forgoing the opportunity to detect dysplasia or early cancer at a curable stage. Furthermore, his current 'as required' low-dose PPI may be insufficient to control acid reflux adequately, which is a cornerstone of management. Therefore, both medication review and entry into a surveillance programme are necessary.<br /><br /><b>High-dose proton pump inhibitor and endoscopic surveillance in 6 months</b> is incorrect. While initiating a high-dose PPI is an appropriate part of the management plan, a repeat endoscopy in 6 months is not indicated for this patient. A 6-month follow-up endoscopy is typically recommended for patients with an initial diagnosis of low-grade dysplasia. This is to confirm the histological finding, as there can be inter-observer variability amongst pathologists, and to ensure no high-grade dysplasia was missed on the index procedure. Since this patient's biopsies showed no dysplasia, this intensive follow-up is not required.<br /><br /><b>Radiofrequency ablation</b> is an incorrect intervention at this stage. Radiofrequency ablation (RFA) is an endoscopic therapy used to eradicate the abnormal Barrett's epithelium. It is the first-line treatment for patients with confirmed dysplasia (both high-grade and low-grade). The procedure involves using heat energy to destroy the metaplastic tissue, which is then replaced by normal squamous epithelium. However, RFA is an invasive procedure with its own risks, including stricture formation, bleeding, and chest pain. Its use is not justified in patients with non-dysplastic Barrett's oesophagus, where the risk of progression to cancer is too low to warrant such an intervention. The strategy is to survey and only intervene with ablative therapy if dysplasia develops.",

            "The correct answer is <b>Croup</b>. Croup, also known as laryngotracheobronchitis, is a common respiratory illness in children aged 6 months to 3 years. It is characterised by a barking cough, stridor (inspiratory), and hoarseness of voice. The fever and coryzal symptoms suggest a viral origin, which is the most common cause of croup. The most common causative organism is <i>Parainfluenza virus</i>.<br /><br /><b>Bronchiolitis</b> is an incorrect option because it typically presents with wheezing and fast breathing rather than stridor. Bronchiolitis affects infants younger than two years old and is caused by <i>Respiratory Syncytial Virus (RSV)</i>. While bronchiolitis can present with fever and cough, the presence of inspiratory stridor makes croup more likely.<br /><br /><b>Bacterial tracheitis</b> is another incorrect option. Bacterial tracheitis is a rare but severe infection of the trachea caused by bacteria such as <i>Staphylococcus aureus</i> or <i>Streptococcus pyogenes</i>. It can present similarly to croup but tends to have a more toxic appearance, higher fever, and rapid progression to respiratory distress. The lack of intercostal recession in this case makes bacterial tracheitis less likely.<br /><br /><b>Pertussis</b>, commonly known as whooping cough, is caused by the bacterium <i>Bordetella pertussis</i>. It typically starts with mild upper respiratory tract symptoms before progressing to paroxysms of coughing followed by an inspiratory 'whoop' sound. While pertussis can present with a cough in young children, the presence of inspiratory stridor and the absence of the characteristic whooping sound make croup a more likely diagnosis.<br /><br />Finally, <b>acute epiglottitis</b> is an incorrect option as well. Acute epiglottitis is a life-threatening condition caused by infection and inflammation of the epiglottis, most commonly due to <i>Haemophilus influenzae</i> type b (Hib). It presents with sudden onset high fever, drooling, severe sore throat, and difficulty breathing. The child often prefers to sit in a tripod position to maintain their airway. The absence of these severe symptoms in this case makes acute epiglottitis unlikely.",

Therefore, antibiotics are not needed for this patient.<br /><br /><b>Oral prednisolone</b> is incorrect. This is an important step in the management of an exacerbation of COPD (patients are usually given 30mg daily). However, there are no signs of infection (consolidation) on the chest x-ray suggesting that the cause of the shortness of breath is unlikely to be due to infection. If the exacerbation was non-infective then the chest x-ray would be expected to be clear, which is not the case here as alveolar oedema is evident.",

        "body": "In 2016 the Chief Medical Officer proposed new guidelines in relation to the safe consumption of alcohol following an expert group report. The most significant change has been a reduction in the number of units it is recommending men do not exceed from 21 to 14, in line with the recommendations for women.<br /><br />The government now recommend the following:<br /><ul><li>men <b>and</b> women should drink no more than 14 units of alcohol per week</li><li>they advise <i>'if you do drink as much as 14 units per week, it is best to spread this evenly over 3 days or more'</i></li><li>pregnant women should not drink. The wording of the official advice is '<i>If you are pregnant or planning a pregnancy, the safest approach is not to drink alcohol at all, to keep risks to your baby to a minimum. Drinking in pregnancy can lead to long-term harm to the baby, with the more you drink the greater the risk.</i>'</li></ul><br />One unit of alcohol is equal to 10 mL of pure ethanol. The 'strength' of an alcoholic drink is determined by the 'alcohol by volume' (ABV).<br /><br />Examples of one unit of alcohol:<br /><ul><li>25ml single measure of spirits (ABV 40%)</li><li>a third of a pint of beer (ABV 5 to 6%)</li><li>half a 175ml 'standard' glass of red wine (ABV 12%)</li></ul><br />To calculate the number of units in a drink multiply the number of millilitres by the ABV and divide by 1,000. For example:<br /><ul><li>half a 175ml 'standard' glass of red wine = 87.5 * 12 / 1000 = 1.05 units</li><li>one bottle of wine = 750 * 12 / 1000 = 9 units</li><li>one pint of 5% beer or lager = 568 * 5 / 1000 = 2.8 units</li></ul>",

NICE advise that clinical judgement is used when determining which one to start first</li><li>beta-blockers licensed to treat heart failure in the UK include <span class=\"concept\" data-cid=\"9704\">bisoprolol, carvedilol, and nebivolol</span>.</li><li>ACE-inhibitors and beta-blockers have no effect on mortality in heart failure with <span class=\"concept\" data-cid=\"8881\"><i>preserved</i></span> ejection fraction </li></ul><br /><h5 class='notes-heading'>Second-line therapy</h5><br />The standard second-line treatment is an <span class=\"concept\" data-cid=\"9528\"><b>aldosterone antagonist</b></span><br /><ul><li>these are sometimes referred to as mineralocorticoid receptor antagonists. Examples include spironolactone and eplerenone</li><li>it should be remembered that both ACE inhibitors (which the patient is likely to already be on) and aldosterone antagonists both cause hyperkalaemia - therefore potassium should be monitored </li></ul><br />There is an increasing role for <span class=\"concept\" data-cid=\"11988\"><b>SGLT-2 inhibitors</b></span> in the management of heart failure with a reduced ejection fraction<br /><ul><li>these drugs reduce glucose reabsorption and increase urinary glucose excretion</li><li>examples include canagliflozin, dapagliflozin and empagliflozin</li><li>the evidence base shows  SGLT-2 inhibitors reduced hospitalisation secondary to heart failure and cardiovascular death</li><li>international guidelines widely recommend their usage. In terms of NICE, a technology appraisal from 2021 support the use of dapagliflozin as an add-on to optimised standard care</li></ul><br /><h5 class='notes-heading'>Third-line therapy</h5><br />Third-line treatment should be initiated by a specialist. Options include ivabradine, sacubitril-valsartan, hydralazine in combination with nitrate, digoxin and cardiac resynchronisation therapy<br /><ul><li>ivabradine<ul><li>criteria: <span class=\"concept\" data-cid=\"10964\">sinus rhythm > 75/min and a left ventricular fraction < 35%</span></li></ul></li><li><span class=\"concept\" data-cid=\"2407\">sacubitril-valsartan</span><ul><li>criteria: left ventricular fraction < 35%</li><li>is considered in heart failure with reduced ejection fraction who are symptomatic on ACE inhibitors or ARBs</li><li><span class=\"concept\" data-cid=\"9700\">should be initiated following ACEi or ARB wash-out period</span></li></ul></li><li>digoxin<ul><li>digoxin has also not been proven to reduce mortality in patients with heart failure. It may however improve symptoms due to its inotropic properties</li><li>it is strongly indicated if there is coexistent <span class=\"concept\" data-cid=\"2862\">atrial fibrillation</span></li></ul></li><li>hydralazine in combination with nitrate<ul><li>this may be particularly indicated in <span class=\"concept\" data-cid=\"3665\">Afro-Caribbean patients</span></li></ul></li><li>cardiac resynchronisation therapy<ul><li>indications include a <span class=\"concept\" data-cid=\"10963\">widened QRS (e.g. left bundle branch block) complex on ECG</span></li></ul></li></ul><br />Other treatments<br /><ul><li>offer <span class=\"concept\" data-cid=\"9705\"><b>annual influenza vaccine</b></span></li><li>offer one-off <b>pneumococcal vaccine</b><ul><li>adults usually require just one dose but those with asplenia, splenic dysfunction or chronic kidney disease need a booster every 5 years</li></ul></li></ul><br /><div class=\"container\"><div class=\"row\"><div class=\"col-md-3\"><a href=\"https://d32xxyeh8kfs8k.cloudfront.net/images_Passmedicine/pdd975b.png\" data-fancybox=\"gallery\" data-caption=\"\"><img  class=\"img-thumbnail mx-auto d-block\" style=\"max-height:150px;margin-bottom:10px;\" src=\"https://d32xxyeh8kfs8k.cloudfront.net/images_Passmedicine/pdd975.png\" alt=\"\" /></a></div></div></div>",
