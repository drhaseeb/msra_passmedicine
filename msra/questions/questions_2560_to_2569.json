            "The correct answer is <b>Dilation and curettage</b>. This procedure involves dilating the cervix and scraping or suctioning tissue from the lining of the uterus. It's typically used to diagnose or treat conditions such as heavy bleeding or to clear the uterine lining after a miscarriage or abortion. Dilation and curettage isn't a recognised treatment for endometriosis because this condition involves endometrial-like tissue growing outside the uterus, not within it. Therefore, scraping the inside of the uterus won't remove these growths.<br /><br />The other options listed are all recognised treatments for endometriosis.<br /><br /><b>Gonadotrophin-releasing hormone analogues</b> are drugs that suppress ovarian function by inhibiting the release of gonadotrophins (luteinising hormone and follicle-stimulating hormone) from the pituitary gland. This creates a state similar to menopause, reducing estrogen levels which can shrink endometrial implants and provide pain relief.<br /><br /><b>Combined oral contraceptive pill</b> is often used in managing endometriosis. The hormones in combined pills can help control menstrual periods, reduce pain associated with endometriosis, and prevent disease progression.<br /><br /><b>Medroxyprogesterone acetate</b> is a progestogen that works by suppressing ovulation and reducing menstrual flow, which can help manage symptoms of endometriosis. <br /><br />Finally, an <b>Intrauterine system (Mirena)</b>, which releases levonorgestrel (a type of progestogen), is also used in treating endometriosis-related pain. It works by thinning the lining of your uterus which reduces menstrual flow and decreases overall inflammation in your pelvic area.<br />",

            "The above scenario describes a young woman presenting with primary amenorrhoea (given that she has never had a menstrual period before), in addition to underdevelopment of secondary sexual characteristics. Given her raised FSH and LH levels, the most likely cause of her primary amenorrhoea is gonadal dysgenesis.<br /><br />Gonadal dysgenesis is a congenital condition in which the gonads are atypically developed, and may be functionless. This can be seen in syndromes such as Turner's syndrome. Due to the abnormal gonads, androgens are not produced in response to FSH and LH from the anterior pituitary gland. This results in the underdevelopment of secondary sexual characteristics, and in females will cause primary amenorrhoea. FSH and LH levels will continue to remain high due to the absence of negative feedback from oestrogen on the hypothalamus.<br /><br />Asherman syndrome is an incorrect answer. This is a condition in which scar tissue adhesions form within the uterus (often following uterine surgeries), causing amenorrhoea. This is an acquired form of amenorrhoea, and does not coincide with the patient's history of no past medical history or absence of secondary sexual characteristics. <br /><br />Imperforate hymen is a cause of primary amenorrhoea. In this congenital condition, the hymen (a membrane within the vagina) does not have a hole in it, meaning that menstrual blood cannot pass. This can present with cyclical abdominal pain which feels like a menstrual period, but does not pass any blood. If untreated, complications such as peritonitis or endometriosis may arise due to retrograde bleeding. Unlike the given case, patients with imperforate hymen should develop normal secondary sexual characteristics, and FSH/LH levels should be normal.<br /><br />Kallmann syndrome is an incorrect answer. Kallmann syndrome is a congenital form of hypogonadotropic hypogonadism, caused by an abnormally functioning hypothalamus. Patients with Kallmann syndrome may present similarly to the above case, but blood results would show low GnRH, FSH, and LH. Exam questions also often mention an absence of the sense of smell, which can be seen in Kallmann syndrome.<br /><br />Given the chronic nature of this amenorrhoea and the absence of secondary sexual characteristics, pregnancy is an incorrect answer.

            "<b>Verapamil</b> is the most likely drug to have caused this patient's rapid haemodynamic collapse. The clinical presentation is that of a stable, regular, broad complex tachycardia. In a patient with a history of ischaemic heart disease, this should be treated as ventricular tachycardia (VT) until proven otherwise. Verapamil is a non-dihydropyridine calcium channel blocker. When administered intravenously to a patient with VT, it can precipitate severe hypotension and cardiovascular collapse. This is due to a combination of negative inotropy (reducing myocardial contractility) and peripheral vasodilation, which the compromised ventricles in VT cannot compensate for. This is a well-established and dangerous interaction, and for this reason, verapamil is absolutely contraindicated in patients with a broad complex tachycardia of unknown origin or known VT. The scenario describes a classic iatrogenic emergency resulting from the incorrect administration of verapamil, likely under the mistaken assumption that the rhythm was supraventricular in origin with aberrant conduction.<br /><br /><b>Adenosine</b> is an incorrect choice. Adenosine is used for the diagnosis and treatment of supraventricular tachycardias (SVTs). It has a very short half-life (less than 10 seconds). If administered to a patient with VT, it is typically ineffective. While it can cause transient side effects such as flushing, chest tightness, and a brief period of asystole or bradycardia, it is very unlikely to cause the profound and sustained haemodynamic collapse described in the scenario. Its transient effect makes it a diagnostic tool in undifferentiated tachycardias, but it would not lead to this severe, lasting deterioration. The patient's collapse is too severe and persistent to be typical of adenosine administration.<br /><br /><b>Amiodarone</b> is an incorrect answer. In fact, amiodarone is the first-line antiarrhythmic agent recommended by the UK Resuscitation Council for the management of stable ventricular tachycardia. It is a class III antiarrhythmic that prolongs the cardiac action potential. While intravenous amiodarone can cause hypotension, this is usually related to the rate of infusion and the solvent it is mixed in (polysorbate 80), rather than a sudden, catastrophic collapse. Given that it is the indicated treatment for this patient's condition, it is highly unlikely to be the cause of such a dramatic deterioration. The clinical picture is one of an adverse reaction to a contraindicated drug, not a side effect of the correct one.<br /><br /><b>Bisoprolol</b> is an incorrect option. Bisoprolol is a cardioselective beta-blocker. While intravenous beta-blockers can be used in the management of certain tachyarrhythmias (often those of supraventricular origin or related to catecholamine excess), they are not a first-line agent for undifferentiated broad complex tachycardia. They can cause hypotension and bradycardia due to their negative inotropic and chronotropic effects. However, the sudden and severe collapse described is much more characteristic of verapamil administration in VT than a beta-blocker. The haemodynamic effects of beta-blockers tend to be more gradual.<br /><br /><b>Lidocaine</b> is an incorrect choice. Lidocaine is a class Ib antiarrhythmic drug that can be used as a second-line agent for stable VT, particularly in the context of ischaemic heart disease. It works by blocking sodium channels. Its primary side effects are neurological (e.g., paraesthesia, confusion, seizures) and it is less likely to cause severe haemodynamic compromise compared to other agents, although it should be used with caution in patients with severe left ventricular dysfunction. A sudden, profound cardiovascular collapse immediately following administration is not a characteristic feature of lidocaine toxicity in this context.",
