        "body": "We know from experience that few patients (around 10%) present with the textbook triad of pleuritic chest pain, dyspnoea and haemoptysis. Pulmonary embolism can be difficult to diagnose as it can present with virtually any cardiorespiratory symptom/sign depending on its location and size.<br /><br /><h5 class='notes-heading'>So which features make pulmonary embolism more likely?</h5><br />The PIOPED study<sup>1</sup> in 2007 looked at the frequency of different symptoms and signs in patients who were diagnosed with pulmonary embolism.<br /><br />The relative frequency of common clinical signs is shown below:<br /><ul><li>Tachypnea (respiratory rate >20/min) - 96%</li><li>Crackles - 58%</li><li><span class=\"concept\" data-cid=\"4029\">Tachycardia</span> (heart rate >100/min) - 44%</li><li>Fever (temperature >37.8\u00b0C) - 43%</li></ul><br />It is interesting to note that the Well's criteria for diagnosing a PE use tachycardia rather than tachypnoea.<br /><br />All patients with symptoms or signs suggestive of a PE should have a history taken, examination performed and a chest x-ray to exclude other pathology.<br /><br /><br /><h5 class='notes-heading'>Pulmonary embolism rule-out criteria (PERC)</h5><br />NICE updated their guidelines on the investigation and management of venous thromboembolism (VTE) in 2020.

            "<b>Switch to modified release metformin</b> is correct. Metformin is the first-line agent in managing type II diabetes mellitus. GI side effects are common and include abdominal cramps, diarrhoea, and taste changes. This woman has developed GI side effects and switching to modified-release metformin is likely to resolve the issue as GI side effects are much less frequent. Modified-release metformin spread the absorption of metformin along the gut and reduces local concentrations of the medication which improves its tolerability.<br /><br /><b>Reassurance as the symptoms will settle</b> is incorrect. Although symptoms might settle with time, it is recommended that patients who develop intolerance due to GI side effects are switched to a modified release type. Continuing the same form might lead to incompliance and poor diabetes control.<br /><br /><b>Switch metformin to dapagliflozin</b> is incorrect.

            "The correct answer is <b>Active and passive movement limited + external rotation most affected</b>. Frozen shoulder, also known as adhesive capsulitis, is characterised by pain and stiffness in the shoulder joint. It typically presents with both active and passive movement limitation due to fibrosis and inflammation of the joint capsule. External rotation is usually the most affected movement in frozen shoulder, followed by abduction and then internal rotation.<br /><br /><b>Only active movement limited + internal rotation most affected</b> is incorrect because it suggests a problem within the muscles or tendons rather than the joint itself. This could be indicative of a rotator cuff injury or impingement syndrome where there is damage to the muscles or tendons that move the shoulder but no involvement of the joint capsule.<br /><br /><b>Active and passive movement limited + abduction most affected</b> might suggest a diagnosis such as subacromial bursitis or rotator cuff tear, where abduction (lifting arm sideways away from the body) may be particularly painful and restricted. However, these conditions would not typically affect all movements equally.<br /><br /><b>Active and passive movement limited + internal rotation most affected</b> does not fit with the typical presentation of adhesive capsulitis. Internal rotation being most affected might suggest an alternative diagnosis such as glenohumeral osteoarthritis.<br /><br />Lastly, <b>Only active movement limited + external rotation most affected</b> could suggest a condition affecting primarily the muscles rather than the joint capsule, such as a rotator cuff tear or impingement syndrome. In these conditions, pain may limit active motion but passive motion (when someone else moves your arm) should remain relatively preserved.<br /><br />In conclusion, while other options may represent different musculoskeletal pathologies affecting shoulder mobility, only 'active and passive movement limited + external rotation most affected' aligns best with UK guidelines for diagnosing frozen shoulder (adhesive capsulitis).",
