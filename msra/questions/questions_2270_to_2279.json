            "<b>Urgent testicular ultrasound</b> is the correct answer. While the clinical findings of a painless, fluctuant swelling that transilluminates are highly suggestive of a hydrocele, the inability to palpate the underlying testis is a significant red flag. A hydrocele can be primary (idiopathic) or secondary to an underlying pathology. Crucially, up to 10% of testicular tumours can present with a secondary or reactive hydrocele, which can mask the underlying solid mass. UK guidelines, including NICE guidance on suspected cancer (NG12), state that any man with a non-painful enlargement or change in shape or texture of the testis should be considered for an urgent ultrasound scan, to be performed within 2 weeks. As the testis cannot be adequately examined in this case, a tumour cannot be excluded clinically. Therefore, urgent imaging is mandatory to visualise the testis, confirm the nature of the swelling, and definitively rule out an underlying malignancy before any further management decisions are made. This is the safest and most appropriate course of action.<br /><br /><b>Aspiration of the swelling</b> is an incorrect next step. Aspiration is a therapeutic procedure for symptomatic hydroceles, not a first-line diagnostic tool. Performing aspiration before imaging is potentially dangerous. If an underlying testicular tumour is present, puncturing it with a needle could theoretically lead to tumour seeding along the needle tract or into the scrotum, and can cause a haematocele which complicates subsequent diagnosis and management. Aspiration should only be considered once a simple hydrocele has been confirmed on ultrasound and malignancy has been confidently excluded. It is generally reserved for older patients who are unfit for surgery, as recurrence rates are high.<br /><br /><b>Refer to routine urology clinic</b> is not the most appropriate next step. While this patient will likely require a urological opinion, a 'routine' referral is too slow given the possibility of an underlying testicular cancer. The inability to palpate the testis means that malignancy must be excluded urgently. The correct pathway is to arrange an urgent testicular ultrasound scan first. The results of this scan will then determine the urgency of the urology referral. If the ultrasound confirms a tumour, the patient would be referred via a 2-week wait cancer pathway. If it confirms a simple hydrocele, a routine referral for consideration of surgical management would then be appropriate.<br /><br /><b>Reassure and advise scrotal support</b> would be a premature and potentially unsafe action. This management is only appropriate for a patient with a confirmed, uncomplicated, and asymptomatic primary hydrocele where the underlying testis has been examined and found to be normal. In this scenario, the testis cannot be assessed, and therefore a serious underlying cause like a tumour has not been excluded. Providing false reassurance could lead to a significant delay in diagnosing a potentially curable malignancy. Scrotal support may provide symptomatic relief but does not address the fundamental need for a definitive diagnosis.<br /><br /><b>Request serum tumour markers</b> (AFP, \u03b2-hCG, LDH) is not the best initial step. While these markers are crucial in the staging and monitoring of testicular germ cell tumours, they are not a primary diagnostic tool for a scrotal mass. Ultrasound is the gold-standard initial investigation due to its high sensitivity for detecting testicular tumours. Furthermore, tumour markers can be normal in a significant proportion of testicular cancers, particularly early-stage seminomas. Therefore, a normal set of markers does not exclude cancer. These blood tests are typically requested by the urology or oncology team in conjunction with imaging, usually once an ultrasound has identified a solid testicular mass, not as a screening tool in primary care.",

The inability to palpate the testis means that malignancy must be excluded urgently. The correct pathway is to arrange an urgent testicular ultrasound scan first. The results of this scan will then determine the urgency of the urology referral. If the ultrasound confirms a tumour, the patient would be referred via a 2-week wait cancer pathway. If it confirms a simple hydrocele, a routine referral for consideration of surgical management would then be appropriate.<br /><br /><b>Reassure and advise scrotal support</b> would be a premature and potentially unsafe action. This management is only appropriate for a patient with a confirmed, uncomplicated, and asymptomatic primary hydrocele where the underlying testis has been examined and found to be normal. In this scenario, the testis cannot be assessed, and therefore a serious underlying cause like a tumour has not been excluded. Providing false reassurance could lead to a significant delay in diagnosing a potentially curable malignancy. Scrotal support may provide symptomatic relief but does not address the fundamental need for a definitive diagnosis.<br /><br /><b>Request serum tumour markers</b> (AFP, \u03b2-hCG, LDH) is not the best initial step. While these markers are crucial in the staging and monitoring of testicular germ cell tumours, they are not a primary diagnostic tool for a scrotal mass. Ultrasound is the gold-standard initial investigation due to its high sensitivity for detecting testicular tumours. Furthermore, tumour markers can be normal in a significant proportion of testicular cancers, particularly early-stage seminomas. Therefore, a normal set of markers does not exclude cancer. These blood tests are typically requested by the urology or oncology team in conjunction with imaging, usually once an ultrasound has identified a solid testicular mass, not as a screening tool in primary care.",

They can be divided into communicating and non-communicating:<br /><ul><li>communicating: caused by patency of the processus vaginalis allowing peritoneal fluid to drain down into the scrotum. Communicating hydroceles are common in newborn males (clinically apparent in 5-10%) and usually resolve within the first few months of life</li><li>non-communicating: caused by excessive fluid production within the tunica vaginalis</li></ul><br />Hydroceles may develop secondary to:<br /><ul><li>epididymo-orchitis</li><li>testicular torsion</li><li>testicular tumours</li></ul><br />Features<br /><ul><li>soft, non-tender swelling of the hemi-scrotum.

Further investigation (e.g. ultrasound) is usually warranted however to exclude any underlying cause such as a tumour</li></ul><br /><h5 class='notes-heading'>Varicocele</h5><br />A varicocele is an abnormal enlargement of the testicular veins. They are usually asymptomatic but may be important as they are associated with infertility. <br /><br />Varicoceles are much more common on the left side (> 80%). Features:<br /><ul><li>classically described as a 'bag of worms'</li><li>subfertility</li></ul><br />Diagnosis<br /><ul><li>ultrasound with Doppler studies</li></ul><br />Management<br /><ul><li>usually conservative</li><li>occasionally surgery is required if the patient is troubled by pain.

            "The correct answer is urticaria. This patient presents with severely itchy, smooth, slightly elevated papules. This is a classical presentation of urticaria (or hives), a vascular reaction of the skin, usually caused by an allergen, but sometimes the trigger is not identifiable. This patient works as a gardener, so it could have been possibly triggered by a species of plants he worked with. The first-line management option is an antihistamine.<br /><br />Angioedema is defined as the formation of oedema of the area beneath the skin or mucosa. The cause can be immunologic, non-immunologic, or idiopathic, and it is a recognised side effect of angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors such as ramipril. Sometimes, it can be accompanied by urticaria. But the patient does not complain of any other symptoms other than the rash, making the diagnosis unlikely. Additionally, angioedema is usually seen on the mouth and face rather than systemic and truncal skin. <br /><br />Atopic dermatitis (or eczema) is a common presentation, especially in children. It presents with pruritic, erythematous, and scaly skin lesions often localized to the flexural surfaces of the body. It is usually associated with asthma, that this patient has. But this patient presents with raised lesions and normal surrounding skin on the back rather than flexor surfaces making the diagnosis unlikely. <br /><br />Erythema multiforme is a hypersensitivity reaction usually triggered by infections. It is characterized by target lesions and is usually initially seen on the back of the hands or feet before spreading to the torso. Pruritus is occasionally seen and is usually mild, whilst this patient is very disturbed by the itchiness. <br /><br />Henoch-Schonlein purpura is an IgA mediated small vessel vasculitis.
