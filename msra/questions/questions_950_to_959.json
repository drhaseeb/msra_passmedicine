            "This image demonstrates an erythematous, swollen and inflamed right leg. The patient has presented with a few days' history of unilateral lower leg discomfort. This is unlikely to be a deep vein thrombosis as she has no identifiable risk factors such as immobilisation, recent surgery, cancer or recent long-haul flights. Her last long-haul plane flight was 8 months ago and it is unlikely that she would present with a deep vein thrombosis at this point afterwards. Furthermore, she has no symptoms of pulmonary embolism such as palpitations, shortness of breath or chest pain. On examination, the right leg is visibly erythematous, swollen and inflamed, which coupled with her temperature of 38\u00baC, suggests an infective aetiology. The diagnosis is therefore cellulitis. The underlying infection is likely bacterial (probably either <i>Streptococcus pyogenes</i> or <i>Staphylococcus aureus</i>).<br /><br /><b>Oral clarithromycin</b> is correct. Although the first-line management for cellulitis is flucloxacillin, this patient is allergic to penicillin. The second-line treatment (which is used for penicillin-allergic patients) would be a macrolide such as clarithromycin or erythromycin or another medication such as doxycycline.<br /><br /><b>Oral flucloxacillin</b> is incorrect as this patient is penicillin-allergic and so this drug is contraindicated. <br /><br /><b>Oral prednisolone</b> is incorrect steroids are not indicated for the treatment of this infective condition. If the patient were on long-term steroids then their steroids would likely need to be doubled during periods of illness (to simulate the normal systemic response to recovery that occurs physiologically), however, there is no mention of this in the text and this would not be the definitive management of a bacterial skin infection.<br /><br /><b>Oral rivaroxaban for 3 months</b> is incorrect. This would be used as anticoagulation for a provoked deep vein thrombosis which is where a clear, underlying precipitant such as cancer, immobility or surgery is thought to be implicated. A longer duration of 6 months would be given for an unprovoked deep vein thrombosis, where no clear cause is found. This patient does not have a deep vein thrombosis as mentioned above.<br /><br /><b> Oral rivaroxaban for 6 months </b> is incorrect.

The question does not mention these other symptoms making this less likely.<br /><br />The choice of <b><i>Leishmania donovani</i></b> is also incorrect.

            "<b>Short Synacthen test</b> is the most appropriate next investigation in this scenario. The patient presents with clinical features highly suggestive of adrenal insufficiency: fatigue, weight loss, hypotension, hyperpigmentation, hypoglycaemia, hyponatraemia, and hyperkalaemia. The low morning cortisol (120 nmol/L) is abnormal but not diagnostic on its own. The Short Synacthen test is the gold standard dynamic test to confirm adrenal insufficiency, measuring cortisol levels before and after administration of synthetic ACTH (Synacthen). This test will determine if the adrenal glands can respond appropriately to stimulation, which is crucial for diagnosis. In primary adrenal insufficiency (Addison's disease), there would be minimal or no increase in cortisol levels after Synacthen administration, confirming the diagnosis before proceeding to determine the underlying cause.<br /><br /><b>Adrenal antibody testing</b> would be premature at this stage. While autoimmune adrenalitis is the most common cause of primary adrenal insufficiency in the UK, antibody testing should follow confirmation of adrenal insufficiency with the Short Synacthen test. Antibody testing alone cannot confirm the diagnosis of adrenal insufficiency and would be inappropriate as the next step.<br /><br /><b>Adrenal CT scan</b> would be indicated after confirming adrenal insufficiency, particularly if autoimmune etiology is less likely or to rule out other causes such as tuberculosis, hemorrhage, or metastases. However, it is not the most appropriate next investigation before confirming the functional diagnosis of adrenal insufficiency.<br /><br /><b>Insulin and C-peptide levels</b> would be appropriate if insulinoma was the primary differential diagnosis. While the patient does have hypoglycaemia, the constellation of other findings (hyperpigmentation, hyponatraemia, hyperkalaemia, and low cortisol) strongly points toward adrenal insufficiency rather than insulinoma.

        "question_notes": "<b>Short Synacthen test</b> is the most appropriate next investigation in this scenario. The patient presents with clinical features highly suggestive of adrenal insufficiency: fatigue, weight loss, hypotension, hyperpigmentation, hypoglycaemia, hyponatraemia, and hyperkalaemia. The low morning cortisol (120 nmol/L) is abnormal but not diagnostic on its own. The Short Synacthen test is the gold standard dynamic test to confirm adrenal insufficiency, measuring cortisol levels before and after administration of synthetic ACTH (Synacthen). This test will determine if the adrenal glands can respond appropriately to stimulation, which is crucial for diagnosis. In primary adrenal insufficiency (Addison's disease), there would be minimal or no increase in cortisol levels after Synacthen administration, confirming the diagnosis before proceeding to determine the underlying cause.<br /><br /><b>Adrenal antibody testing</b> would be premature at this stage. While autoimmune adrenalitis is the most common cause of primary adrenal insufficiency in the UK, antibody testing should follow confirmation of adrenal insufficiency with the Short Synacthen test. Antibody testing alone cannot confirm the diagnosis of adrenal insufficiency and would be inappropriate as the next step.<br /><br /><b>Adrenal CT scan</b> would be indicated after confirming adrenal insufficiency, particularly if autoimmune etiology is less likely or to rule out other causes such as tuberculosis, hemorrhage, or metastases. However, it is not the most appropriate next investigation before confirming the functional diagnosis of adrenal insufficiency.<br /><br /><b>Insulin and C-peptide levels</b> would be appropriate if insulinoma was the primary differential diagnosis. While the patient does have hypoglycaemia, the constellation of other findings (hyperpigmentation, hyponatraemia, hyperkalaemia, and low cortisol) strongly points toward adrenal insufficiency rather than insulinoma.
