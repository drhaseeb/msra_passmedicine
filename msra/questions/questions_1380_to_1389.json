            "<b>Oral morphine</b> is the correct first-line pharmacological treatment for ongoing dyspnoea in palliative care when reversible causes have been addressed. The scenario describes a patient with metastatic lung cancer who has persistent breathlessness despite treatment of potentially reversible causes (infection and pleural effusion). Opioids are the evidence-based first-line treatment for refractory dyspnoea in palliative care, with oral morphine being preferred for ongoing symptoms due to its longer duration of action compared to subcutaneous routes. Morphine works by reducing the central perception of breathlessness and decreasing respiratory drive, providing significant symptomatic relief. The dose should be started low (typically 2.5-5mg every 4 hours) and titrated according to response. This approach aligns with current UK palliative care guidelines which recommend opioids as first-line therapy for dyspnoea when specific treatments have failed or are inappropriate.<br /><br /><b>Subcutaneous midazolam</b> is not appropriate as first-line treatment for ongoing dyspnoea. Midazolam is a benzodiazepine that may be used in combination with opioids in the terminal phase of illness when breathlessness is particularly distressing, or when there is significant associated anxiety. However, it would not be the primary choice for managing chronic dyspnoea and is typically reserved for acute situations or end-of-life care where rapid sedation may be required.<br /><br /><b>Oral lorazepam</b> could be considered if there was significant associated anxiety or panic with the breathlessness, but it is not the first-line treatment for dyspnoea itself. Benzodiazepines like lorazepam are secondary options in palliative dyspnoea management and would typically be used alongside opioids rather than as monotherapy. The scenario does not specifically mention anxiety or panic symptoms, making this a less appropriate choice than opioids.<br /><br /><b>Nebulised saline</b> is not an established treatment for dyspnoea in palliative care. While nebulised medications can be useful in specific circumstances (such as nebulised morphine in some cases), normal saline nebulisers do not have evidence supporting their use for cancer-related dyspnoea. This would not address the underlying symptom effectively and is not recommended in current guidelines.<br /><br /><b>Oral prednisolone</b> might have a role in specific circumstances such as lymphangitis carcinomatosa or superior vena cava obstruction, but it is not first-line treatment for general cancer-related dyspnoea. Corticosteroids can have significant side effects in palliative patients and should only be used when there is a specific indication. The scenario does not suggest features that would make steroids the most appropriate choice.",

Lastly, we can see some arterial narrowing and retinal haemorrhage superior to the optic nerve, due to the high blood pressure. The presence of papilloedema is pathognomonic for a category IV Keith-Wagener hypertensive retinopathy, making this the correct option. <br /><br /><b>Category I</b> is incorrect. This category is defined by the presence of arteriolar narrowing and tortuosity and increased light reflex, which can be observed here, but papilloedema can be observed as well which represents the most extensive damage to the eye thus making this category IV. <br /><br /><b>Category II</b> is incorrect. This category is defined by the presence of arteriovenous nipping, defined as arterioles causing compression of the veins where they cross which can be observed here. Papilloedema can also be observed in this fundoscopy, and its presence makes this a category IV Keith-Wagener hypertensive retinopathy, hence, this is an incorrect option. <br /><br /><b>Category III</b> is incorrect. This category is defined by the presence of cotton-wool exudates and retinal haemorrhages, which can be observed here, but the presence of papilloedema is an indicator of a category IV Keith-Wagener hypertensive retinopathy, making this an incorrect option. <br /><br /><b>Category V</b> is incorrect.

            "<b>Indapamide</b> is correct. The patient's symptoms of nausea, fatigue, and seeing halos around lights, combined with an elevated digoxin level (1.9 \u00b5g/L), strongly suggest digoxin toxicity. Indapamide, a thiazide-like diuretic, can predispose patients to digoxin toxicity by causing hypokalemia. Low potassium levels increase the binding of digoxin to its receptor (the sodium-potassium ATPase), enhancing its effect and increasing the risk of toxicity. Since this patient is taking digoxin, diuretics like indapamide can exacerbate the risk of toxicity through electrolyte imbalances (especially low potassium or magnesium).<br /><br /><b>Phenytoin</b> is incorrect. Phenytoin is an anticonvulsant that can reduce digoxin levels by enhancing its metabolism by introducing cytochrome P450 enzymes. While phenytoin can treat arrhythmias caused by digoxin toxicity, it would not predispose to digoxin toxicity in this patient as it lowers rather than increases digoxin levels.<br /><br /><b>Rifampicin</b> is incorrect. Rifampicin is a potent inducer of the cytochrome P450 system, which increases the metabolism of digoxin, potentially lowering its serum levels. Rifampicin could reduce the risk of digoxin toxicity, not predispose to it. Therefore, it is not the likely cause of elevated digoxin levels in this scenario.<br /><br /><b>Sodium alginate</b> is incorrect.

        "question": "A 74-year-old woman with a history of chronic heart failure presents to the emergency department complaining of nausea and fatigue. She describes visual disturbances, such as seeing halos around lights. Her current medication includes digoxin. Her blood pressure is 130/80 mmHg. An ECG indicates atrial fibrillation with a ventricular rate of 65 bpm. Investigations show:<br /><br /><div class=\"table-responsive\"><table class = \"tb\" ><tbody><tr><td>Digoxin level</td><td>1.9 \u00b5g/L</td><td>(0.5-1.0)</td></tr></tbody></table></div><br />Which medication most likely predisposes this patient to the suspected diagnosis?",
        "correct_answer": "1",
        "question_notes": "<b>Indapamide</b> is correct. The patient's symptoms of nausea, fatigue, and seeing halos around lights, combined with an elevated digoxin level (1.9 \u00b5g/L), strongly suggest digoxin toxicity. Indapamide, a thiazide-like diuretic, can predispose patients to digoxin toxicity by causing hypokalemia. Low potassium levels increase the binding of digoxin to its receptor (the sodium-potassium ATPase), enhancing its effect and increasing the risk of toxicity. Since this patient is taking digoxin, diuretics like indapamide can exacerbate the risk of toxicity through electrolyte imbalances (especially low potassium or magnesium).<br /><br /><b>Phenytoin</b> is incorrect. Phenytoin is an anticonvulsant that can reduce digoxin levels by enhancing its metabolism by introducing cytochrome P450 enzymes. While phenytoin can treat arrhythmias caused by digoxin toxicity, it would not predispose to digoxin toxicity in this patient as it lowers rather than increases digoxin levels.<br /><br /><b>Rifampicin</b> is incorrect. Rifampicin is a potent inducer of the cytochrome P450 system, which increases the metabolism of digoxin, potentially lowering its serum levels. Rifampicin could reduce the risk of digoxin toxicity, not predispose to it. Therefore, it is not the likely cause of elevated digoxin levels in this scenario.<br /><br /><b>Sodium alginate</b> is incorrect. Sodium alginate is an antacid used to manage gastro-oesophageal reflux disease. It does not significantly interact with digoxin or influence its metabolism or absorption in a way that would predispose the patient to digoxin toxicity. <br /><br /><b>St John's wort</b> is incorrect. St John's Wort is an herbal supplement that induces the activity of cytochrome P450 enzymes, which enhances digoxin clearance and reduces serum levels. Thus, St John's Wort would be likelier to lower digoxin levels rather than increase them, making it an unlikely cause of digoxin toxicity in this patient.",

            "The most likely diagnosis, in this case, is <b>growing pains</b>. Growing pains are a common cause of musculoskeletal pain in children, typically affecting the legs and occurring at night. They are usually bilateral and self-limiting, with no other associated symptoms or signs. The clinical examination in this case is unremarkable, which further supports the diagnosis of growing pains.<br /><br /><b>Legg-Calve-Perthes disease</b> is an incorrect option because it is a condition that affects the hip joint, not the shins and ankles. It occurs due to avascular necrosis of the femoral head and presents with hip or groin pain, as well as a limp or limited range of motion in the affected hip. Additionally, Legg-Calve-Perthes disease usually presents between 4 and 8 years old but would have abnormal findings on examination like limited internal rotation and abduction.<br /><br /><b>Osteoid osteoma</b> is also an incorrect option as it typically presents with localized pain that is worse at night and relieved by nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs). However, it usually affects only one bone rather than being bilateral as described in this case. Furthermore, these benign bone tumours often present with swelling or tenderness on examination.<br /><br /><b>Talipes equinovarus</b>, commonly known as clubfoot, is an incorrect option because it is a congenital deformity of the foot that would have been apparent since birth. This condition involves abnormal positioning of the foot with inward twisting (varus) and downward pointing (equinus) deformities. It does not present with shin or ankle pain at night time.<br /><br />Lastly, <b>osteochondritis dissecans</b> is also an incorrect choice because it tends to affect older children or adolescents who are involved in sports activities. This condition involves the separation of a fragment of cartilage and subchondral bone from the joint surface, typically in the knee, ankle, or elbow. It presents with joint pain, swelling, and mechanical symptoms such as locking or catching. The described symptoms and age of the patient do not fit this diagnosis.<br /><br />In summary, the most likely diagnosis for this 6-year-old boy with bilateral shin and ankle pain at night-time is growing pains, as it fits the clinical presentation and has no remarkable findings on examination.",

            "<b>Exenatide</b> is correct. A GLP-1 receptor agonist is indicated here as third-line treatment with metformin, sulphonylurea and DDP-4 inhibitor was ineffective, and his BMI is over 35. GLP-1 receptor agonists should only be continued if there is a reduction of at least 11 mmol/mol [1.0%] in HbA1c and a weight loss of at least 3% of initial body weight in 6 months.<br /><br /><b>No additional medication</b> is incorrect. His HbA1c remains above his target range of 58mmol/mol (7.5%) and therefore escalation of treatment should be offered to improve his glycaemic control. <br /><br /><b>Dapagliflozin</b> is incorrect. SGLT2-inhibitors should be avoided in active foot disease (such as skin ulceration, osteomyelitis, or gangrene) due to the possible increased risk of lower limb amputation (mainly toes).<br /><br /><b>Sitagliptin</b> is incorrect as a trial of a DDP4-inhibitor has already been undertaken unsuccessfully. <br /><br /><b>Pioglitazone</b> is incorrect as given his BMI, a GLP-1 receptor agonist would be the preferred option to add to his existing treatment. <br /><br /><b>Gliclazide</b> is incorrect as he already takes glimepiride, an alternative sulphonylurea.",
            "<b>Sitagliptin</b> is correct. Her HbA1c is above the target range for metformin monotherapy (58mmol/mol, or 7.5%), and as she is on the maximum dose of metformin NICE guidelines recommend adding a second agent. As she has a background of heart failure and CKD4, the most appropriate option would be a DDP-4 inhibitor such as sitagliptin (prescribed at a reduced dose due to CKD4).  <br /><br /><b>No additional medication</b> is incorrect. Her HbA1c is now above her target range of 58mmol/mol (7.5%) and therefore escalation of treatment should be offered to improve her glycaemic control. <br /><br /><b>Dapagliflozin</b> is incorrect as it is an SGLT2 inhibitor. Her recent trial of an SGLT2 inhibitor was associated with the complication of euglycaemic diabetic ketoacidosis. SGLT2 inhibitors should immediately be discontinued and subsequently contraindicated in this instance. <br /><br /><b>Pioglitazone</b> is incorrect as it should be avoided in heart failure. <br /><br /><b>Gliclazide</b> is incorrect as sulphonylureas should generally be avoided in severe renal impairment. However, as gliclazide is principally metabolized in the liver, NICE guidelines suggest it could be considered at the lowest dose to provide blood glucose control. In this case, sitagliptin remains the safer option, however, gliclazide could be considered if a DDP-4 inhibitor is not tolerated or is ineffective. <br /><br /><b>Exenatide</b> is incorrect as a GLP-1 receptor agonist is only indicated after third-line treatment is ineffective or not tolerated."
