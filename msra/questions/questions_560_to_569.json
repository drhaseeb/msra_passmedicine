            "The correct answer for this question is <b>Rifampicin, isoniazid, pyrazinamide and ethambutol</b>. According to the UK guidelines, the initial treatment of pulmonary tuberculosis involves a combination of four drugs: rifampicin, isoniazid, pyrazinamide, and ethambutol. This regimen should be taken for two months (intensive phase), followed by a continuation phase with rifampicin and isoniazid for an additional four months. The use of these four drugs helps to prevent the development of drug resistance and ensures effective treatment.<br /><br />The first incorrect option, <b>Isoniazid, pyrazinamide and ethambutol</b>, omits rifampicin from the regimen. Rifampicin is a crucial component of the standard initial therapy due to its potent bactericidal activity against both rapidly multiplying and dormant <i>Mycobacterium tuberculosis</i> organisms. Omitting rifampicin may lead to suboptimal treatment outcomes and increased risk of drug resistance.<br /><br />The second incorrect option, <b>Rifampicin, isoniazid and pyrazinamide</b>, excludes ethambutol from the treatment regimen. Ethambutol is included in the initial therapy because it provides additional coverage against potential drug resistance while awaiting susceptibility testing results. Once susceptibility results are available and confirm sensitivity to rifampicin and isoniazid, ethambutol can be discontinued if appropriate.<br /><br />The third incorrect option, <b>Rifampicin, isoniazid, pyrazinamide, ethambutol and streptomycin</b>, adds streptomycin to the standard four-drug regimen. While streptomycin can be used as part of tuberculosis treatment in certain cases (e.g., multidrug-resistant tuberculosis or intolerance to other first-line drugs), it is not part of the standard initial therapy for drug-sensitive pulmonary tuberculosis in the UK.<br /><br />The final incorrect option, <b>Rifampicin and isoniazid</b>, includes only two of the four recommended drugs for initial treatment. This combination is used during the continuation phase (months 3-6) of treatment, but it is insufficient for the intensive phase because it does not provide adequate coverage against potential drug resistance and may lead to suboptimal treatment outcomes.",

            "<b>Magnesium sulphate is the correct answer</b>. This patient has torsades de pointes which is a form of polymorphic ventricular tachycardia that can be precipitated by hypothermia. Magnesium sulfate is the first-line therapy and is used to stabilise the cardiac membrane. <br /><br /><b>Adenosine is the incorrect answer</b>. It is used to revert patients back to sinus rhythm with supraventricular tachycardias. It is inappropriate to use adenosine in this patient as it would not solve the torsades.<br /><br /><b>Amiodarone is the incorrect answer</b>. It is used in the management of broad complex tachycardia in stable patients. It is also used in resuscitation scenarios for shockable and non-shockable rhythms. This patient has torsades de pointes which is caused by a prolonged QT interval. Giving amiodarone will prolong the QT further and therefore risk making the patient worse. <br /><br /><b>Atropine is the incorrect answer</b>.

            "The correct answer is <b>Lichen sclerosus</b>. This is a chronic inflammatory condition that typically affects post-menopausal women and presents with white, atrophic plaques that are intensely pruritic. The condition commonly affects the anogenital region in a figure-of-eight pattern but can also affect other areas of the body, as seen in this case with the inner thigh involvement. The absence of vaginal discharge is typical of lichen sclerosus, as it primarily affects the vulvar skin rather than the vaginal mucosa.<br /><br /><b><i>Candida</i></b> typically presents with vaginal discharge, which is notably absent in this case. The discharge is usually thick and white ('cottage cheese-like'), and whilst it can cause vulval irritation, it does not typically cause white plaques. Candidal infections are also more common in younger women and those with risk factors such as diabetes or recent antibiotic use.<br /><br /><b>Lichen planus</b> affecting the vulva typically presents with erosive lesions that are painful rather than itchy. The classical appearance includes a lacy white pattern (Wickham's striae) with erythematous borders, rather than white plaques. It also commonly affects the vaginal mucosa and can cause discharge and bleeding.<br /><br /><b>Herpes simplex</b> presents as painful vesicles that ulcerate, not as white plaques. The lesions are typically bilateral and associated with systemic symptoms during primary infection. The presentation would be more acute rather than chronic, and pain would be the predominant symptom rather than itch.<br /><br /><b>Seborrhoeic dermatitis</b> typically affects sebum-rich areas such as the scalp, face, and chest. When it affects the genital area, it presents as erythematous patches with yellowish greasy scale, not white plaques. It would be unusual for seborrhoeic dermatitis to affect only the vulva and inner thigh without other typical areas being involved.",
