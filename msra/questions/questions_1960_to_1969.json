            "The correct answer is <b>Sleep disturbances</b>. Beta-blockers, such as propranolol and metoprolol, are known to cause sleep disturbances in some patients. This side effect may present as insomnia, nightmares, or non-restorative sleep (feeling unrefreshed after sleep). The exact mechanism is not fully understood but it's believed that beta-blockers can interfere with the production of melatonin, a hormone that helps regulate sleep.<br /><br />The option <b>Exacerbation of glaucoma</b> is incorrect. While it is true that some medications can exacerbate glaucoma, beta-blockers are actually used in the treatment of this condition. Topical beta-blockers like timolol are commonly used to reduce intraocular pressure in glaucoma.<br /><br /><b>Urinary retention</b> is also an incorrect choice. Urinary retention is more commonly associated with medications that have anticholinergic effects such as tricyclic antidepressants and certain antihistamines. Beta-blockers do not have anticholinergic properties and therefore do not typically cause urinary retention.<br /><br />The option <b>Exacerbation of eczema</b> is another incorrect answer. Eczema or atopic dermatitis is a skin condition characterised by dryness and recurrent rashes. It can be exacerbated by numerous factors including environmental triggers and stress but there's no evidence to suggest that beta-blockers would worsen this condition.<br /><br />Finally, <b>Palpitations</b>, whilst a common symptom reported in cardiovascular diseases, are unlikely to be caused by beta-blocker use. On the contrary, beta-blockers are often used to manage palpitations as they slow down the heart rate and decrease the force of contraction thereby reducing the likelihood of palpitations occurring.<br />",

Croup, also known as laryngotracheobronchitis, is most commonly caused by the parainfluenza virus, specifically types 1 and 2. This viral infection results in inflammation of the larynx, trachea and bronchi leading to a characteristic barking cough, stridor and hoarseness.<br /><br /><b>Symptoms are typically worse during the day</b> is incorrect. The symptoms of croup are often worse at night due to increased sympathetic activity which can cause further narrowing of the already inflamed airways.

            "<b>Intravenous alteplase followed by mechanical thrombectomy</b> is the correct answer. This patient presents within 6 hours of symptom onset with a confirmed proximal anterior circulation occlusion (right middle cerebral artery). According to current UK guidelines, she meets the criteria for both thrombolysis and thrombectomy. NICE recommends offering thrombectomy as soon as possible and within 6 hours of symptom onset, together with intravenous thrombolysis (if within 4.5 hours), to people who have acute ischaemic stroke with confirmed occlusion of the proximal anterior circulation. Since this patient is within the 4.5-hour window for thrombolysis and within the 6-hour window for thrombectomy, both treatments should be offered together. The combination of thrombolysis followed by thrombectomy has been shown to improve outcomes compared to either treatment alone in eligible patients. Her blood pressure of 168/92 mmHg is acceptable for thrombolysis (the threshold is <185/110 mmHg), so no delay for blood pressure reduction is needed.<br /><br /><b>Intravenous alteplase only</b> would be suboptimal management. While this patient is within the 4.5-hour window for thrombolysis and this would be appropriate treatment in isolation, it fails to utilise mechanical thrombectomy which offers additional benefit. The presence of a confirmed proximal anterior circulation occlusion on CT angiography makes her an ideal candidate for thrombectomy, and current guidelines recommend offering both treatments together when patients meet criteria for both within the appropriate time windows.<br /><br /><b>Mechanical thrombectomy only</b> would not be appropriate. Although this patient has a confirmed proximal middle cerebral artery occlusion suitable for thrombectomy, she is also within the 4.5-hour window for thrombolysis. Current NICE guidelines specifically recommend offering thrombectomy together with intravenous thrombolysis when patients are within 4.5 hours of symptom onset. There is no contraindication to thrombolysis in this case, and the combination therapy provides better outcomes than thrombectomy alone.<br /><br /><b>Aspirin 300mg orally</b> is not the most appropriate immediate management in this scenario. While aspirin should be given as soon as possible after excluding haemorrhage in acute ischaemic stroke, it should not be given if the patient is being considered for thrombolysis. This patient meets criteria for both thrombolysis and thrombectomy, which take priority over antiplatelet therapy. Aspirin would typically be commenced 24 hours after thrombolysis, or immediately if thrombolysis is not given.<br /><br /><b>Blood pressure reduction then intravenous alteplase</b> is incorrect because this patient's blood pressure does not require reduction before thrombolysis. The threshold for blood pressure reduction prior to thrombolysis is >185/110 mmHg. This patient's blood pressure of 168/92 mmHg is below this threshold and therefore acceptable for immediate thrombolysis.

NICE recommend that all decisions about thrombectomy take into account a patient's overall clinical status:<br /><ul><li>NICE recommend a pre-stroke functional status of less than 3 on the modified Rankin scale and a score of more than 5 on the National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale (NIHSS)</li></ul><br />Offer thrombectomy as soon as possible and within <span class=\"concept\" data-cid=\"9594\">6 hours of symptom onset</span>, together <span class=\"concept\" data-cid=\"9596\">with intravenous thrombolysis (if within 4.5 hours)</span>, to people who have:<br />acute ischaemic stroke and<br /><ul><li>confirmed occlusion of the <b>proximal anterior circulation</b> demonstrated by computed tomographic angiography (CTA) or magnetic resonance angiography (MRA) </li></ul><br />Offer thrombectomy as soon as possible to people who were last known to be well between <span class=\"concept\" data-cid=\"9595\">6 hours and 24 hours previously (including wake-up strokes)</span>:<br /><ul><li>confirmed occlusion of the <b>proximal anterior circulation</b> demonstrated by CTA or MRA and</li><li>if there is the <span class=\"concept\" data-cid=\"9595\">potential to salvage brain tissue, as shown by imaging such as CT perfusion or diffusion-weighted MRI sequences showing limited infarct core volume</span></li></ul><br /><i>Consider</i> thrombectomy together with intravenous thrombolysis (if within 4.5 hours) as soon as possible for people last known to be well up to 24 hours previously (including wake-up strokes):<br /><ul><li>who have acute ischaemic stroke and confirmed occlusion of the <b>proximal posterior circulation (that is, basilar or posterior cerebral artery)</b> demonstrated by CTA or MRA and</li><li>if there is the potential to salvage brain tissue, as shown by imaging such as CT perfusion or diffusion-weighted MRI sequences showing limited infarct core volume</li></ul><br /><br /><h5 class='notes-heading'>Secondary prevention</h5><br />Recommendations from NICE include:<br /><ul><li><span class=\"concept\" data-cid=\"10231\">clopidogrel is now recommended</span> by NICE ahead of combination use of aspirin plus modified-release (MR) dipyridamole in people who have had an ischaemic stroke</li><li><span class=\"concept\" data-cid=\"10232\">aspirin is recommended after an ischaemic stroke only if clopidogrel is contraindicated or not tolerated</span></li></ul><br /><span class=\"concept\" data-cid=\"4059\">Carotid endarterectomy</span> is recommend if the patient has suffered a stroke or TIA in the carotid territory and is not severely disabled<br /><ul><li>should only be considered if the stenosis > 50% according to North American Symptomatic Carotid Endarterectomy Trial (NASCET) criteria</li></ul>  - it should be noted that previous guidelines have used other reporting methods, that have resulted in different cut-offs, e.g. European Carotid Surgery Trial (ECST) with a cut-off of 70%<br /><ul><li>it should be performed as soon as possible within 7 days</li></ul>",

This is most likely to have occurred because the patient is on long-term anti-psychotics and has then received metoclopramide. <br /><br />Midazolam will relieve the anxiety but will not solve his dystonic reaction. <br /><br />Lorazepam is a benzodiazepine like midazolam but longer acting. It will relieve the anxiety but will not solve his dystonia. <br /><br />Propofol is used in anaesthetic situations such as induction of anaesthesia. It will not help in relieving the symptoms.<br /><br />Haloperidol is D2 antagonist. It can block dopaminergic receptors in the basal ganglia which is responsible for normal tone and fine-tuning of movements. It would, therefore, make the situation worse as it is one of the causes for acute dystonic reaction.",

            "The correct answer in this case is <b>Having a parent with schizophrenia</b>. This is because a family history of schizophrenia, particularly in first-degree relatives such as parents, significantly increases the risk of developing psychotic disorders. It is estimated that individuals with a parent who has schizophrenia have around a 10% chance of developing the condition themselves. This increased risk is thought to be due to both genetic factors and shared environmental influences.<br /><br /><b>Indian subcontinent ethnicity</b> is not considered a strong risk factor for psychotic disorders. Although some studies have suggested that certain ethnic groups may have higher rates of psychosis compared to others, these differences are often attributed to social and environmental factors rather than inherent biological differences between ethnicities.<br /><br />A history of <b>long-term cannabis use</b> has been associated with an increased risk of developing psychotic disorders, but the strength of this association is weaker than having a parent with schizophrenia. While there is evidence suggesting that regular cannabis use can increase the likelihood of experiencing psychotic symptoms, it remains unclear whether this relationship is causal or simply reflects an underlying vulnerability to psychosis among individuals who use cannabis.<br /><br />While a history of being <b>sexually abused when younger</b> has been linked to various mental health issues, including depression, anxiety, and post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), the association between childhood sexual abuse and psychotic disorders is less clear-cut. Some studies have reported an increased risk of psychosis among individuals who experienced sexual abuse during childhood; however, this relationship appears to be weaker than the link between parental schizophrenia and psychosis.<br /><br />Finally, <b>working in the performing arts</b> does not represent a significant risk factor for psychotic disorders. Although some research has suggested that creative individuals may be more prone to certain mental health issues such as mood disorders or substance misuse problems, there is no robust evidence linking involvement in the performing arts specifically with an increased risk of developing psychosis.",
