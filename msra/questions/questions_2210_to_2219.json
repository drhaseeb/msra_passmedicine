Another treatment that may be considered at this point would be a nitrate infusion, but this option is not given; hence, CPAP is the correct option.<br /><br /><b> Digoxin </b> is a cardiac glycoside that is positively ionotropic and negatively chronotropic. It may be used as a third-line therapy in chronic heart failure management, especially if there is concomitant atrial fibrillation. Still, it would not be indicated in acute heart failure management. Patients with refractory pulmonary oedema may end up in the intensive care unit and require ionotropic drugs if there is severe left ventricular systolic dysfunction, but this would be with drugs such as dobutamine rather than digoxin.<br /><br /><b> Empagliflozin </b> is a sodium-glucose co-transporter 2 inhibitor, historically used in the treatment of type 2 diabetes. More recently, these drugs have been introduced as part of the management of chronic heart failure, with evidence showing improved outcomes for those with a reduced ejection fraction. However, they are only for chronic use and are not indicated in acute pulmonary oedema as in this case.<br /><br /><b> Hydralazine </b> may be used in combination with nitrates as another third-line option in chronic heart failure. Whilst nitrate infusions may be given in acute heart failure, hydralazine has no role in the acute setting.

            "<b>Hashimoto's thyroiditis</b> is the correct diagnosis. This is the most common cause of hypothyroidism in iodine-replete countries like the UK. The patient is a middle-aged woman presenting with classic symptoms of hypothyroidism (fatigue, weight gain, cold intolerance), which is confirmed biochemically by a high TSH and low free T4. The key clinical finding that points towards Hashimoto's thyroiditis is the presence of a firm, non-tender goitre. This is caused by lymphocytic infiltration of the thyroid gland. The diagnosis would typically be confirmed by the presence of anti-thyroid peroxidase (anti-TPO) antibodies, which are positive in over 90% of cases. The combination of clinical features, biochemical results, and examination findings makes this the most likely diagnosis.<br /><br /><b>De Quervain's thyroiditis</b> (subacute thyroiditis) is less likely. While it can cause a transient hypothyroid phase following an initial thyrotoxic phase, its hallmark feature is a painful, tender goitre, often preceded by a viral upper respiratory tract infection. The patient in this scenario has a non-tender goitre, making this diagnosis improbable. The inflammatory markers (ESR/CRP) would also typically be markedly elevated in De Quervain's thyroiditis.<br /><br /><b>Iodine deficiency</b> is a cause of goitre and hypothyroidism, but it is rare in the UK due to adequate dietary iodine intake and the use of iodised salt. While it remains the most common cause of hypothyroidism worldwide, in the context of a patient in the UK, an autoimmune cause like Hashimoto's thyroiditis is statistically far more probable. The clinical presentation can be identical, but the epidemiology makes this an unlikely diagnosis in this setting.<br /><br /><b>Primary atrophic hypothyroidism</b> is an incorrect choice. This is another common autoimmune cause of hypothyroidism, but it is pathologically distinct from Hashimoto's thyroiditis. It is characterised by the presence of TSH-receptor blocking antibodies which lead to glandular atrophy and fibrosis. Consequently, patients with primary atrophic hypothyroidism do not develop a goitre; in fact, their thyroid gland is typically impalpable. The presence of a goitre in this patient effectively rules out this diagnosis.<br /><br /><b>Riedel's thyroiditis</b> is a very rare chronic inflammatory condition characterised by the replacement of normal thyroid tissue with dense fibrous tissue. While it can cause hypothyroidism and a goitre, the goitre is typically described as 'rock-hard' or 'woody' in consistency and may be fixed to adjacent structures, causing compressive symptoms. Given its extreme rarity and the description of a 'firm' rather than 'rock-hard' goitre, Hashimoto's thyroiditis is a much more likely diagnosis.",
