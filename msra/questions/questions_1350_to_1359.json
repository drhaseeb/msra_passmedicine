            "<b>Drug-induced pneumonitis</b> is correct. Methotrexate-induced pneumonitis is a known side effect of methotrexate therapy, presenting with dry cough, dyspnoea, and fever. The subacute progression of symptoms (over three weeks), absence of infection, and X-ray findings of bilateral interstitial infiltrates strongly support this diagnosis.

            "The correct answer is <b>Friedreich's ataxia</b>, which is a neurodegenerative disorder inherited in an autosomal recessive pattern. It is caused by mutations in the FXN gene, which codes for the protein frataxin. Both copies of the gene must be mutated for the condition to manifest, which is characteristic of autosomal recessive inheritance. The condition typically presents in childhood or adolescence with progressive ataxia, loss of proprioception, and cardiomyopathy.<br /><br /><b>Hypokalaemic periodic paralysis</b> is actually inherited in an autosomal dominant pattern. It results from mutations in genes coding for calcium or sodium ion channels, most commonly the CACNA1S gene. Only one copy of the mutated gene is needed for the condition to manifest.<br /><br /><b>Adult polycystic kidney disease</b> is inherited in an autosomal dominant pattern. It is caused by mutations in either the PKD1 or PKD2 genes. The condition leads to the formation of multiple cysts in the kidneys and can present with hypertension, haematuria, and progressive renal failure.<br /><br /><b>Huntington's disease</b> is a classic example of autosomal dominant inheritance. It is caused by a trinucleotide repeat expansion in the HTT gene. The condition shows complete penetrance, meaning that everyone who inherits the mutated gene will develop the disease if they live long enough.<br /><br /><b>Ehlers-Danlos syndrome</b> typically shows autosomal dominant inheritance, although some rare subtypes can be autosomal recessive or X-linked. The most common form, hypermobile EDS, is inherited in an autosomal dominant pattern. The condition affects collagen synthesis and results in joint hypermobility, skin hyperextensibility, and tissue fragility.",

Yellow nail syndrome is characterised by slow-growing, thickened yellow nails often associated with lymphoedema and respiratory disorders such as chronic sinusitis or bronchiectasis. It is not commonly associated with psoriasis, which is a systemic inflammatory disease primarily affecting the skin and joints. <br /><br />Discussing the incorrect options:<br /><br /><b>Loss of nail</b> can occur in severe cases of psoriasis, particularly if there's extensive pitting or onycholysis. Psoriatic nails may become so weakened by these changes that they shed entirely.<br /><br /><b>Onycholysis</b>, which refers to the separation of the nail from the nail bed, is one of the most common nail changes seen in psoriasis. It typically starts at the tip of the nail and progresses towards the root, leading to a whitish appearance due to air under the detached portion of the nail.<br /><br /><b>Pitting</b>, or small depressions on the surface of the nails, is another classic feature of psoriatic nails. These pits result from increased shedding of cells from the base layer of the epidermis in tiny areas scattered across the nail plate.<br /><br />Lastly, <b>subungual hyperkeratosis</b>, or thickening under the nails, can also occur in psoriasis due to excessive production and accumulation of keratinocytes (skin cells) beneath the nail plate.

Psoriatic nails may become so weakened by these changes that they shed entirely.<br /><br /><b>Onycholysis</b>, which refers to the separation of the nail from the nail bed, is one of the most common nail changes seen in psoriasis. It typically starts at the tip of the nail and progresses towards the root, leading to a whitish appearance due to air under the detached portion of the nail.<br /><br /><b>Pitting</b>, or small depressions on the surface of the nails, is another classic feature of psoriatic nails. These pits result from increased shedding of cells from the base layer of the epidermis in tiny areas scattered across the nail plate.<br /><br />Lastly, <b>subungual hyperkeratosis</b>, or thickening under the nails, can also occur in psoriasis due to excessive production and accumulation of keratinocytes (skin cells) beneath the nail plate. This causes an irregular, often painful thickening that lifts up and distorts the overlying nail.",

Some of the key changes include recommending the following:<br /><ul><li>the use of direct oral anticoagulants (DOACs) as first-line treatment for most people with VTE</li><li>the use of DOACs in patients with active cancer, as opposed to low-molecular weight heparin as was the previous recommendation</li><li>outpatient treatment in low-risk pulmonary embolism (PE) patients</li><li>routine cancer screening is no longer recommended following a VTE diagnosis</li></ul><br /><br /><h5 class='notes-heading'>Outpatient treatment in low-risk PE patients</h5><br />Deep vein thrombosis has for a long time been treated on an outpatient condition.

            "The correct answer is <b>Right 3rd nerve palsy</b>.<br /><br />The third cranial nerve (oculomotor nerve) innervates most of the extraocular muscles, including the superior rectus, inferior rectus, medial rectus, and inferior oblique muscles. It also supplies the levator palpebrae superioris muscle and carries parasympathetic fibres to the pupil. In a right 3rd nerve palsy, the affected eye typically deviates 'down and out' due to the unopposed actions of the lateral rectus (innervated by the 6th nerve) and superior oblique (innervated by the 4th nerve) muscles. This matches the description of the right eye turning downwards and outwards when looking forward.<br /><br />Additionally, the patient is unable to adduct the right eye when looking to the left because the medial rectus muscle, which is responsible for adduction, is innervated by the 3rd nerve. The worsening of double vision on left gaze is consistent with this, as the eyes become more misaligned when the patient attempts to use the affected muscle. When looking to the right, the angle of the squint decreases because this direction of gaze relies less on the affected muscles.<br /><br /><b>Left 3rd nerve palsy</b> is incorrect because the symptoms described involve the right eye, not the left. In a left 3rd nerve palsy, the left eye would deviate downwards and outwards, and the patient would have difficulty adducting the left eye when looking to the right.<br /><br /><b>Left 6th nerve palsy</b> is incorrect because the 6th nerve (abducens nerve) innervates only the lateral rectus muscle, which is responsible for abduction of the eye. A left 6th nerve palsy would cause the left eye to deviate inwards (esotropia) due to unopposed action of the medial rectus, and the patient would have difficulty abducting the left eye when looking to the left. This does not match the described presentation.<br /><br /><b>Right 4th nerve palsy</b> is incorrect because the 4th nerve (trochlear nerve) innervates only the superior oblique muscle, which primarily intorts the eye and helps with depression when the eye is adducted. A right 4th nerve palsy would typically cause vertical diplopia that worsens on looking down and to the left, with the affected eye elevated relative to the normal eye. The patient would not have difficulty with adduction, and the eye would not typically turn outwards in primary gaze.<br /><br /><b>Right 6th nerve palsy</b> is incorrect because, as mentioned earlier, the 6th nerve innervates only the lateral rectus muscle. A right 6th nerve palsy would cause the right eye to deviate inwards and the patient would have difficulty abducting the right eye when looking to the right. This contradicts the description of the eye turning outwards and the patient having difficulty with adduction rather than abduction.",
