            "<b>Flucloxacillin</B> is correct. The presentation is classic for flucloxacillin-induced cholestatic hepatitis. Flucloxacillin is the first-line IV antibiotic for osteomyelitis caused by sensitive <i>Staphylococcus aureus</i>. A key characteristic of its toxicity is the delayed onset, often appearing several weeks after the course has been completed, exactly as described. The jaundice and pruritus are hallmark features.<br /><br /><b>Amoxicillin</b> is incorrect. Amoxicillin is very rarely associated with liver injury, and when it does occur, it is typically a mixed or hepatocellular pattern, not a pure cholestatic picture. It also does not have the characteristic delayed onset described. Furthermore, amoxicillin alone would not be a standard choice for intravenous treatment of osteomyelitis.<br /><br /><b>Ciprofloxacin</b> is incorrect. While ciprofloxacin is used for bone infections (especially Gram-negative), it is not a common cause of cholestatic jaundice. Its more characteristic side effects are tendonitis, arthropathy, and central nervous system effects like lowering the seizure threshold. Liver injury from ciprofloxacin is uncommon and not typically delayed by several weeks.<br /><br /><b>Co-amoxiclav</b> is incorrect. Co-amoxiclav is a well-known cause of drug-induced liver injury, which can be cholestatic or mixed. The latency period can be variable. However, it is less commonly used for long-term IV therapy for osteomyelitis compared to other agents, and the delay of 6 weeks is less classically associated with it than with another drug on the list.<br /><br /><b>Doxycycline</b> is an incorrect cause. Doxycycline is associated with other side effects like photosensitivity and gastrointestinal upset. It is very rarely associated with significant liver injury, and this would not be a delayed cholestatic presentation. It is also not a typical IV antibiotic for osteomyelitis.<br /><br /><b>Erythromycin</b> is incorrect. Erythromycin is known to cause cholestatic hepatitis, but this usually occurs during treatment or shortly after, not with a 6-week delay. Furthermore, erythromycin is not a first-line agent for osteomyelitis.<br /><br /><b>Metronidazole</b> is an unlikely cause. Metronidazole is not associated with a delayed cholestatic hepatitis. Its more common side effects are gastrointestinal upset, a metallic taste, and a disulfiram-like reaction with alcohol. While it can be used in bone infections as part of a combination regimen, it is not the primary culprit for this specific liver injury pattern.<br /><br /><b>Trimethoprim</b> is an incorrect cause. Trimethoprim is associated with haematological side effects (eg. macrocytic anaemia due to folate antagonism) and skin rashes. It is not a recognised cause of cholestatic jaundice. It is also not used as a single agent for IV treatment of osteomyelitis.",
            "<b>Trimethoprim</b> is correct. Trimethoprim is a folate antagonist. It works by inhibiting bacterial dihydrofolate reductase. With long-term use, it can also mildly inhibit the human enzyme, leading to functional folate deficiency. This deficiency impairs DNA synthesis, resulting in the production of larger-than-normal red blood cells, ie. macrocytic anaemia. This is a well-documented side effect of prolonged trimethoprim therapy, making it the clear cause in this scenario, especially given its common use for urinary tract infection prophylaxis.<br /><br /><b>Amoxicillin</b> is incorrect. Amoxicillin is not associated with causing macrocytic anaemia. Its common side effects include diarrhoea and the characteristic non-allergic rash if given during Epstein-Barr virus infection. It does not interfere with folate or vitamin B12 metabolism.<br /><br /><b>Ciprofloxacin</b> is incorrect. Ciprofloxacin is not known to cause macrocytic anaemia. Its significant side effects include tendonitis and tendon rupture, as well as a lowered seizure threshold. It does not antagonise folate, which is the primary mechanism by which an antibiotic would cause this blood disorder.<br /><br /><b>Co-amoxiclav</b> is incorrect. Co-amoxiclav is not associated with macrocytic anaemia. Its most notable side effect is cholestatic jaundice. Like other broad-spectrum penicillins, it is not linked to folate deficiency or B12 malabsorption.<br /><br /><b>Doxycycline</b> is an incorrect cause. Doxycycline is not a cause of macrocytic anaemia. Its prominent side effect is photosensitivity. Tetracyclines can cause various other issues, but they do not interfere with the pathways that lead to macrocytosis.<br /><br /><b>Erythromycin</b> is incorrect. Erythromycin is not associated with macrocytic anaemia. Its key side effects are gastrointestinal upset (nausea, vomiting, diarrhoea) and QT prolongation on the ECG. It does not affect folate metabolism.<br /><br /><b>Flucloxacillin</B> is incorrect. Flucloxacillin is not known to cause macrocytic anaemia. Its major side effect is delayed cholestatic hepatitis, which can present several weeks after treatment. Haematological suppression leading to macrocytosis is not a feature of its profile.<br /><br /><b>Metronidazole</b> is an unlikely cause. Metronidazole is not typically associated with macrocytic anaemia. Its most famous side effect is a disulfiram-like reaction with alcohol. While it can cause other side effects, it is not a recognised cause of folate deficiency anaemia. Long-term use has been rarely linked to peripheral neuropathy, not macrocytosis.",
            "<b>Ciprofloxacin</b> is correct. This is a highly likely cause. Ciprofloxacin (a fluoroquinolone antibiotic) is well-documented to have neurotoxic effects and can lower the seizure threshold. Furthermore, some fluoroquinolones can potentially increase the plasma concentration of lamotrigine by inhibiting its metabolism, further increasing the risk of toxicity or breakthrough seizures. It is a plausible choice for a chest infection, especially if atypical pathogens were suspected.<br /><br /><b>Amoxicillin</b> is incorrect. Amoxicillin is not known to significantly lower the seizure threshold or cause major interactions with lamotrigine. Its key side effect in this context is a rash with glandular fever, which is not relevant here.<br /><br /><b>Co-amoxiclav</b> is incorrect. This is an unlikely cause. While any severe infection can potentially lower the seizure threshold, co-amoxiclav itself is not specifically known for causing seizures or interacting dangerously with lamotrigine. Its prominent side effect is cholestatic jaundice.<br /><br /><b>Doxycycline</b> is an incorrect cause. This is an unlikely cause. Doxycycline is not associated with lowering the seizure threshold or significant interactions with lamotrigine. Its main relevant side effect is photosensitivity. It is, however, a common antibiotic for chest infections (e.g., atypical pneumonia).<br /><br /><b>Erythromycin</b> is incorrect. Erythromycin is a potent enzyme inhibitor (of CYP3A4). Lamotrigine is metabolised by UGT enzymes, not significantly by CYP3A4, so a major interaction is less probable. Erythromycin itself is not strongly epileptogenic. Its main side effects are GI upset and QT prolongation. Ciprofloxacin is more likely, given that it is a fluoroquinolone antibiotic that is well-documented to have neurotoxic effects and can lower the seizure threshold.<br /><br /><b>Flucloxacillin</B> is incorrect. This is an unlikely cause. Flucloxacillin is primarily used for gram-positive infections like cellulitis or osteomyelitis, not typically as a first-line for a standard chest infection. It is not known for causing seizures or interacting with lamotrigine. Its key side effect is delayed cholestasis.<br /><br /><b>Metronidazole</b> is an unlikely cause. Metronidazole is an antibiotic commonly used to treat infections caused by anaerobic bacteria and certain parasites, such as bacterial vaginosis, pelvic inflammatory disease, dental infections, and infections of the abdomen (like diverticulitis). Metronidazole is a well-known cause of seizures, particularly at high doses or in patients with a predisposition, such as a history of epilepsy. It can lower the seizure threshold independently of any major drug interaction with lamotrigine. However, it would be the unlikely antibiotic of choice for a chest infection, making ciprofloxacin more likely.<br /><br /><b>Trimethoprim</b> is incorrect. Trimethoprim is used primarily for urinary tract infections. It is not a typical treatment for a chest infection and is not known for causing seizures or interacting significantly with lamotrigine. Its key side effects are rashes and potential blood dyscrasias."

            "The correct answer is <b>A female child of a heterozygous female carrier has a 50% chance of being a carrier</b>. This is true because in X-linked recessive inheritance, females have two X chromosomes and thus can be carriers without showing the disease phenotype. If a female is heterozygous for an X-linked recessive trait, she will pass on the affected X chromosome to approximately half of her offspring. Therefore, each female child has a 50% probability of inheriting the affected gene and thus being a carrier.<br /><br /><b>An example is Friedreich's ataxia</b> is incorrect. Friedreich's ataxia is an example of autosomal recessive inheritance, not X-linked recessive inheritance. It means that this disorder affects both sexes equally and requires two copies of the mutated gene, one from each parent, to manifest the disease.<br /><br /><b>50% of the male offspring of affected males will manifest the disease</b> is also incorrect. In fact, none of the male offspring from an affected male will inherit the disease because males pass on their Y chromosome to their sons, not their X chromosome which carries the mutation.<br /><br />The statement <b>An affected child's uncle on the paternal side will also manifest the disease</b> is false as well. In X-linked recessive inheritance diseases, an affected male cannot pass on his condition to his nephews through his brothers since he passes his Y chromosome to his sons who are their fathers.<br /><br />Lastly, <b>50% of the female offspring of affected males will be carriers</b> is wrong because all female offspring (100%) from an affected father would be carriers. This occurs because daughters always receive their father's single X chromosome which carries the mutation in case he suffers from an X-linked recessive disorder.",

            "The correct answer is <b>Course of amoxicillin stopping 3 weeks ago</b>. The 13C-urea breath test is a non-invasive diagnostic tool used to detect the presence of <i>Helicobacter pylori</i> infection in the stomach. Amoxicillin is an antibiotic that can be used to treat <i>H. pylori</i> infections, and its recent use may lead to false-negative results on the urea breath test due to eradication or suppression of the bacteria. It is recommended that patients should not have taken any antibiotics within four weeks prior to the test to ensure accurate results.<br /><br /><b>Use of Gaviscon around 10 days ago</b> should not affect the accuracy of the 13C-urea breath test. Gaviscon is an antacid and does not have any antibacterial properties against <i>H. pylori</i>. Therefore, its use would not interfere with detecting the presence of this bacterium in the stomach.<br /><br /><b>Use of ranitidine stopping 4 weeks ago</b> should also not impact the accuracy of the test as it has been stopped for an appropriate duration. Ranitidine is an H2-receptor antagonist that reduces gastric acid secretion but does not directly affect <i>H. pylori</i>. However, it may cause false-negative results if used within two weeks before testing as it can reduce bacterial load by decreasing acidity levels in the stomach.<br /><br /><b>Use of lansoprazole stopping 6 weeks ago</b> would not decrease the accuracy of a 13C-urea breath test either. Lansoprazole is a proton pump inhibitor (PPI) that suppresses gastric acid secretion. PPIs may cause false-negative results if used within two weeks before testing as they can reduce bacterial load by decreasing acidity levels in the stomach, similar to H2-receptor antagonists. However, since lansoprazole was stopped six weeks ago, this should not be a concern.<br /><br />Lastly, <b>Current use of the combined oral contraceptive pill</b> has no known effect on the accuracy of a 13C-urea breath test.

            "The correct answer is <b>Group A haemolytic streptococci</b>. Scarlet fever, also known as scarlatina, is primarily caused by group A beta-haemolytic streptococci (GABHS), specifically the bacterium <i>Streptococcus pyogenes</i>. This organism produces an erythrogenic toxin that leads to the characteristic rash of scarlet fever. The disease mainly affects children and presents with a sore throat, fever, strawberry tongue and a fine sandpaper-like rash.<br /><br /><b><i>Staphylococcus aureus</i></b> is incorrect because while it can cause skin infections and other illnesses like food poisoning, toxic shock syndrome, and septicaemia, it does not cause scarlet fever. However, it's worth noting that <i>S. aureus</i> can co-infect with GABHS and complicate the clinical picture.<br /><br /><b>Human herpesvirus type 6</b> is also not responsible for causing scarlet fever. Instead, this virus causes roseola infantum (also known as sixth disease), which is characterised by a high fever followed by a pink-red raised or flat rash on the trunk which may spread to the limbs but rarely involves the face.<br /><br /><b>Parvovirus B19</b>, on the other hand, causes erythema infectiosum (also known as fifth disease) or 'slapped cheek' syndrome in children. It presents with a bright red rash on both cheeks giving them a slapped appearance. It does not cause scarlet fever.<br /><br />Finally, <b>Coxsackie A16</b> virus is associated with hand-foot-and-mouth disease (HFMD). HFMD typically starts with a mild nonspecific febrile illness followed by oral ulcers and maculopapular or vesicular rash on hands and feet. It does not cause scarlet fever.<br />",
