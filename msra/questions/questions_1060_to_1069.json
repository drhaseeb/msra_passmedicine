The presentation of severe sore throat, lethargy, and headache, followed by the development of a rash after amoxicillin administration, is highly characteristic of infectious mononucleosis (IM), caused by Epstein-Barr virus (EBV). Approximately 90% of patients with IM who receive aminopenicillins develop a maculopapular rash, which is not a true allergic reaction but rather a result of the interaction between the virus and the antibiotic. This is particularly common in adolescents and young adults, who are the typical demographic for IM.<br /><br /><b>Kawasaki disease</b> is incorrect as it typically affects children under 5 years of age and presents with a constellation of symptoms including fever for at least 5 days, bilateral conjunctival injection, changes in the lips and oral cavity, cervical lymphadenopathy, polymorphous rash, and changes in the extremities.

The timing and context of this rash, along with the preceding symptoms, are more consistent with IM.<br /><br /><b>HIV seroconversion</b> is incorrect because although it can present with similar symptoms (fever, sore throat, rash), the temporal relationship with amoxicillin administration and the typical age group make IM more likely. HIV seroconversion rash is not specifically associated with antibiotic administration.<br /><br /><b>Beta-lactamase producing streptococcal sore throat</b> is incorrect because while it would explain antibiotic failure, it would not account for the development of the rash after amoxicillin administration.

            "The correct answer is <b>Familial adenomatous polyposis</b>. This condition is usually inherited in an autosomal dominant fashion, meaning that an affected individual has a 50% chance of passing the mutated gene to each offspring. Familial adenomatous polyposis (FAP) is caused by mutations in the APC gene which leads to the development of hundreds to thousands of polyps in the colon and rectum from a young age. If left untreated, there's almost a 100% chance of these polyps becoming malignant.<br /><br /><b>Friedreich's ataxia</b> is not typically associated with autosomal dominant inheritance. It's actually inherited in an autosomal recessive manner, which means both copies of the gene in each cell have mutations. The parents of an individual with an autosomal recessive condition each carry one copy of the mutated gene, but they typically do not show signs and symptoms of the condition. Friedreich's ataxia results from mutations in the FXN gene that lead to progressive damage to the nervous system.<br /><br /><b>Hurler's syndrome</b>, also known as mucopolysaccharidosis type I (MPS I), is also not inherited in an autosomal dominant pattern. Instead, it follows an autosomal recessive pattern like Friedreich's ataxia. MPS I is characterized by a deficiency of alpha-L-iduronidase, an enzyme that breaks down glycosaminoglycans (GAGs) within lysosomes.<br /><br /><b>Phenylketonuria</b> (PKU) too does not follow an autosomal dominant inheritance pattern. PKU is another example of an autosomal recessive genetic disorder where both parents must be carriers for a child to be affected. In this condition, a mutation in the PAH gene leads to high levels of phenylalanine in the blood due to deficient phenylalanine hydroxylase enzyme activity.<br /><br />Lastly, <b>Haemochromatosis</b>, specifically hereditary haemochromatosis (HH), is most commonly caused by mutations in the HFE gene and follows an autosomal recessive inheritance pattern as well. Individuals with HH absorb too much iron from their diet and excess iron gets stored in major organs such as the liver, heart and pancreas leading eventually to organ damage if untreated.<br />",

        "body": "Norovirus, also known as the winter vomiting bug, is one of the most common causes of gastroenteritis in the UK according to NHS England. It is a genus that encompasses a range of non encapsulated RNA virus species. The CDC (Centre for Disease Prevention and Control) estimates that 1 in 5 cases of infectious gastroenteritis are caused by norovirus, with 685 million cases per year worldwide. <br /><br />Symptoms <br /><ul><li>Develop within 15 - 50 hours of infection (quoted from the European Centre of Disease Control and Prevention), with patients experiencing nausea, vomiting, and diarrhoea, which may be accompanied by headaches, low-grade fevers, and myalgia. </li><li><span class=\"concept\" data-cid=\"10319\">The majority of patients experience both vomiting and diarrhoea</span></li><li>10 - 22% reported a headache and up to 47% of patients reported fevers (Clinical Microbiology Reviews, Norovirus, January 2015)</li></ul><br />Transmission <br /><ul><li>Faecal-oral route, with the virus becoming aerosolized when the patient vomits or when a toilet containing infected bodily fluids (vomit or faeces) is flushed. </li><li>Viral particles are transmitted directly to surrounding potential hosts and to surrounding surfaces, from which they can be transmitted by cross-contamination (for example a patient visitor touching the patient environment, then eating without first washing their hands). </li><li>Infection may also be transmitted from an infected individual in the process of direct physical contact, or contact with food preparation. </li><li>The virus enters the cell via host receptor-mediated endocytosis and replicates in the small intestine. Norovirus is highly contagious, the European Centre of Disease Control and Prevention estimates that only 10 - 100 viral particles are required to cause an active infection. </li><li>Norovirus is not at present considered to be a notifiable disease in the UK. </li></ul><br />Limiting transmission<br /><ul><li>Isolation of infected strongly recommended where possible, particularly in areas where the risk of person to person transmission is high, for example, in hospitals schools, and care facilities</li><li>Good hand hygiene using soap and water is essential  </li><li><span class=\"concept\" data-cid=\"10320\">Alcohol hand gel has been shown to be less effective in reducing transmission</span></li></ul><br />Diagnosis <br /><ul><li>Clinical history and stool culture viral PCR (polymerase chain reaction). </li></ul><br />Differential diagnoses <br /><ul><li>Features most suggestive of norovirus include sudden onset vomiting, relatively short duration of symptoms and contact with others with similar symptoms.</li><li>Rotavirus, <i>E. coli</i> and Salmonella infections will all cause similar clinical pictures, however, there are some important differentiating features. </li><li>Salmonella infection has an incubation period of 6 - 72 hours and is often the result of contact with contaminated animal products, for example, unpasteurized eggs or milk. Unlike norovirus, salmonella gastroenteritis can cause bloody diarrhoea and patients often have a high fever. </li><li>Rotavirus gastroenteritis causes symptoms very similar to those of norovirus, but predominantly affects children under the age of 5 years. </li><li><i>E. coli</i> infection, like Norovirus, causes vomiting and diarrhoea but has a longer incubation period (between 3-4 days but can be up to 10 days following pathogen exposure) and unlike Norovirus, E Coli infection commonly causes severe abdominal cramping and frequently causes bloody diarrhoea. </li></ul><br />Resolution and Potential Complications<br /><ul><li>The infection is self-limiting in immunocompetent patients and symptoms generally resolve within 72 hours</li><li>Dehydration and electrolyte imbalances may arise as a result of vomiting and diarrhoea, leading to significant morbidity and mortality and patients should be managed supportively with rehydration and electrolyte supplementation where necessary.</li></ul>",

            "This gentleman has severe hypokalaemia, defined as a serum potassium < 2.5mmol/l. Mild to moderate hypokalaemia can be asymptomatic but the more severe the electrolyte derangement the more likely that symptoms will develop. Symptoms include weakness, leg cramps, palpitations secondary to cardiac arrhythmias and ascending paralysis. <br /><br />Causes can be secondary to:<br /><br />1.) Increased potassium loss:<br /><ul><li>Drugs: thiazides, loop diuretics, laxatives, glucocorticoids, antibiotics</li><li>GI losses: diarrhoea, vomiting, ileostomy</li><li>Renal causes: dialysis</li><li>Endocrine disorders: hyperaldosteronism, Cushing's syndrome</li></ul><br />2.)

Magnesium depletion (associated with increased potassium loss)<br /><br />ECG changes seen in hypokalaemia include: <br /><ul><li>U waves</li><li>T wave flattening</li><li>ST segment changes</li></ul><br />Treatment of hypokalaemia depends on severity. Any causative agents should be removed. Gradual replacement of potassium via the oral route is preferred if possible. <br /><br />Mild to moderate hypokalaemia 2.5 - 3.4 mmol/l can be treated with oral potassium provided the patient is not symptomatic and there are no ECG changes.<br /><br />Severe hypokalaemia (<2.5mmol/l) or symptomatic hypokalaemia should be managed with IV replacement. The patient should be managed in an area where cardiac monitoring can take place. If there are no contraindications to fluid therapy (e.g. volume overload, heart failure) potassium should be diluted to low concentrations as higher concentrations can be phlebitic. The infusion rate should not exceed 20mmol/hr. In this case, 3 bags of 0.9% Saline with 40mmol KCL is the correct answer. <br /><br />",
