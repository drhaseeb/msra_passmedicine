            "The correct answer is <b>COPD</b>. Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD) can cause falsely elevated B-type natriuretic peptide (BNP) levels. BNP is primarily released from ventricular myocytes in response to increased wall tension and volume overload. In COPD, particularly during exacerbations, patients can develop pulmonary hypertension and right ventricular strain, which can lead to increased BNP production. Additionally, the hypoxia and inflammatory state associated with COPD can directly stimulate BNP release. This means that when interpreting BNP results in patients with COPD, clinicians should consider that values may be elevated due to the underlying respiratory condition rather than heart failure alone.<br /><br /><b>ACE inhibitor therapy</b> is incorrect. Angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors actually tend to reduce BNP levels rather than increase them. ACE inhibitors decrease cardiac preload and afterload, reducing ventricular wall stress and thereby decreasing the stimulus for BNP release. In patients with heart failure, ACE inhibitors are a cornerstone of therapy precisely because they reduce ventricular strain and improve cardiac remodelling. Therefore, ACE inhibitor therapy would not account for a falsely elevated BNP.<br /><br /><b>Beta-blocker therapy</b> is incorrect. Similar to ACE inhibitors, beta-blockers typically reduce BNP levels in patients with heart failure over time. By blocking sympathetic stimulation of the heart, beta-blockers reduce heart rate, blood pressure, and myocardial oxygen demand, which leads to decreased ventricular wall stress. This results in reduced BNP production rather than elevation. Beta-blockers are an essential component of heart failure management and would not cause falsely elevated BNP readings.<br /><br /><b>Furosemide therapy</b> is incorrect. Furosemide is a loop diuretic that reduces preload by increasing urinary sodium and water excretion. This reduction in preload decreases ventricular filling pressures and wall stress, which should lead to a reduction in BNP levels rather than an elevation. In heart failure management, diuretics like furosemide are used to relieve congestion, and successful diuresis is often associated with falling BNP levels as the heart's workload decreases.<br /><br /><b>Obesity</b> is incorrect, but in an interesting way. Obesity is actually associated with lower BNP levels, not elevated ones. Adipose tissue contains natriuretic peptide clearance receptors that increase the clearance of BNP from circulation. This means that obese patients may have falsely low BNP levels relative to their degree of heart failure, not falsely elevated ones. Clinicians should consider using lower diagnostic thresholds for BNP when evaluating obese patients for heart failure.",

            "<b>Oral metronidazole</b> is the correct answer. This patient has classic features of <i>Trichomonas vaginalis</i> infection: offensive yellow-green discharge, elevated vaginal pH (>4.5), and the diagnostic finding of motile flagellated trophozoites on wet mount microscopy. <i>Trichomonas vaginalis</i> is a sexually transmitted protozoan infection that responds to nitroimidazole antibiotics. The standard treatment is oral metronidazole for 5-7 days, though a single 2g dose is also effective according to UK guidelines. It is important to treat sexual partners simultaneously to prevent reinfection, and patients should be advised to avoid alcohol during treatment and for 48 hours afterwards due to the disulfiram-like reaction. Other STIs should be screened for given the sexual transmission route.<br /><br /><b>Intravaginal clindamycin</b> is used to treat bacterial vaginosis, which can present with vaginal discharge and elevated pH. However, bacterial vaginosis typically causes a thin, grey-white discharge with a fishy odour rather than the yellow-green frothy discharge seen here. The key distinguishing feature is the microscopy finding of motile trophozoites rather than clue cells, making this diagnosis incorrect for this patient.<br /><br /><b>Oral fluconazole</b> is the treatment for vulvovaginal candidiasis. Whilst candidiasis can cause vulval irritation and discharge, the discharge is typically thick, white, and cottage cheese-like rather than yellow-green and offensive. Additionally, candidiasis is associated with a normal vaginal pH (<4.5), and microscopy would show pseudohyphae and spores rather than motile organisms.<br /><br /><b>Intramuscular ceftriaxone</b> is used to treat gonorrhoea, which can cause purulent vaginal discharge and cervicitis. However, gonorrhoea typically presents with a purulent rather than frothy discharge, and microscopy would show intracellular Gram-negative diplococci on Gram stain rather than motile flagellated organisms. The elevated pH and specific microscopy findings make trichomoniasis the clear diagnosis.<br /><br /><b>Oral doxycycline</b> is used to treat chlamydia infection, which commonly presents with mucopurulent cervical discharge. However, chlamydia often causes minimal symptoms and would not produce the characteristic motile organisms seen on microscopy. The vaginal pH may be normal, and the specific microscopy findings of flagellated protozoa are diagnostic of trichomoniasis rather than chlamydia.",

            "<b>Anal fissure</b> is the correct diagnosis. The classic presentation of an anal fissure is severe, sharp, or 'tearing' pain during and after defecation, associated with a small amount of bright red rectal bleeding, typically seen on the toilet paper. The pain is often disproportionate to the size of the lesion and can be so severe that patients develop a fear of defecation, leading to constipation, which in turn worsens the fissure. In this scenario, the patient's age, the nature of the pain (severe and sharp on defecation), the type of bleeding (bright red on paper), and the finding of posterior anal tenderness all strongly point towards this diagnosis. Around 90% of anal fissures occur on the posterior midline due to relatively poor blood supply in this area, making it more susceptible to tearing.<br /><br /><b>Thrombosed haemorrhoid</b> is a plausible differential as it causes significant perianal pain and can be associated with rectal bleeding. However, the pain from a thrombosed haemorrhoid is typically constant and throbbing, rather than being primarily associated with the act of defecation. On examination, a tender, purplish, and firm lump would usually be visible or palpable at the anal verge, which is not described in this patient's presentation. While internal haemorrhoids can bleed, they are typically painless unless they prolapse and thrombose.<br /><br /><b>Proctitis</b> refers to inflammation of the rectal lining. While it can cause rectal bleeding and discomfort, the pain is not typically the severe, sharp, tearing pain described by this patient, which is so characteristic of a fissure. Proctitis is more commonly associated with symptoms of tenesmus (a feeling of incomplete evacuation), rectal discharge (mucus or pus), and a more constant, dull ache rather than sharp pain specifically on defecation.<br /><br /><b>Perianal abscess</b> is an infection resulting in a collection of pus near the anus. This presents with severe, constant, and throbbing perianal pain that is not exclusively linked to defecation. Patients are often systemically unwell with fever and malaise. Examination would typically reveal a fluctuant, erythematous, and exquisitely tender swelling in the perianal region, which is a different clinical picture from the one presented.<br /><br /><b>Colorectal carcinoma</b> is an important differential for any patient presenting with rectal bleeding. However, it is a much less likely diagnosis in this case. Bleeding from a colorectal tumour is often mixed with the stool and can be darker in colour, although bright red bleeding can occur with rectal tumours. Crucially, colorectal cancer is typically painless in its early stages. The presence of severe pain on defecation makes an anal fissure far more probable, especially in a 34-year-old.",

            "Mid-shaft humeral fractures are associated with radial nerve injury. As such, the radial nerve needs to be tested. This may be achieved in a number of ways, but extending the wrist is the only one of the above options that will test radial nerve function (as the radial nerve supplies innervation to the extensor muscles). Palsy of the radial nerve is associated with 'wrist drop'.<br /><br />Extending the elbow would test the radial nerve, but as the injury is at the shaft of the humerus, innervation of the triceps may arise proximal to a radial nerve injury. This would mean that a more distal injury could be missed. As such, while this will probably be performed, it is not going to give as much information as extension of the wrist. <br /><br />References:<br />Shao YC, Harwood P, Grotz MR, et al. (2005).

        "question_notes": "Mid-shaft humeral fractures are associated with radial nerve injury. As such, the radial nerve needs to be tested. This may be achieved in a number of ways, but extending the wrist is the only one of the above options that will test radial nerve function (as the radial nerve supplies innervation to the extensor muscles). Palsy of the radial nerve is associated with 'wrist drop'.<br /><br />Extending the elbow would test the radial nerve, but as the injury is at the shaft of the humerus, innervation of the triceps may arise proximal to a radial nerve injury. This would mean that a more distal injury could be missed. As such, while this will probably be performed, it is not going to give as much information as extension of the wrist. <br /><br />References:<br />Shao YC, Harwood P, Grotz MR, et al. (2005).
