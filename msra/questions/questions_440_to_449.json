            "This patient is presenting with a unilateral bloody discharge and a small lumpy mass. This is most likely to be a duct papilloma. These occur in middle-aged women and develop in the lactiferous ducts just below the nipple. They form a lumpy mass and are associated with a bloody discharge. <br /><br />Fat necrosis is most commonly seen in patients after trauma and is typically seen in women with large breasts. Despite this vignette indicating that the patient has not noticed any trauma, fat necrosis can occur after trivial or unnoticed trauma. As the patient has noticed bloody discharge, however, this is not the most likely answer as patients will typically present with a firm and round mass which may become hard and irregular in shape. <br /><br />A fibroadenoma is also known as a 'breast mouse'. These are not associated with bloody nipple discharge. They are usually found in women under 35 years old and present as firm rubbery non-tender masses which may slip away during palpation.<br /><br />Fibroadenosis, also known as fibrocystic disease or benign mammary dysplasia, is most commonly seen in middle-aged women. It presents with painful, lumpy breasts which will often 'flare' prior to menstruation. <br /><br />Mammary duct ectasia is a benign breast condition in which the milk ducts beneath the nipple become inflamed and dilated. Patients usually present with an angry, erythematous breast with a creamy or green discharge. It occurs most often in women during or after menopause.",

            "The correct answer is that <b>contraception is needed until 12 months after her last period</b>. According to the UK guidelines, women aged 50 years and older should continue using contraception until they have been amenorrhoeic for at least 12 consecutive months. This is because the menopause cannot be confirmed until a woman has not had a period for one year. In this case, the patient's last period was 7 months ago, so she still requires contraception to prevent unintended pregnancy.<br /><br />The option stating <b>she no longer requires contraception</b> is incorrect because the patient has not yet met the criteria of being amenorrhoeic for 12 consecutive months. It would be premature to assume that she has completed the menopause and no longer needs contraception.<br /><br />The option suggesting <b>contraception is needed until 36 months after her last period</b> is also incorrect as it significantly exceeds the recommended duration of contraceptive use post-menopause according to UK guidelines. Continuing contraception for such an extended period may expose the patient to unnecessary side effects and risks associated with long-term contraceptive use.<br /><br />Similarly, the options stating <b>contraception is needed until 18 months after her last period</b> and <b>contraception is needed until 24 months after her last period</b> are both incorrect as they exceed the recommended duration of contraceptive use in postmenopausal women according to UK guidelines. The appropriate advice for this patient would be to continue using contraception until she reaches 12 consecutive months without a menstrual period.",

        "question": "A 52-year-old woman presents to surgery seeking advice regarding contraception. She has recently started in a new relationship but is unsure if she requires contraception, as she thinks she may be going through the menopause. She is experiencing hot flushes and her last period was 7 months ago. What is the most appropriate advice?",
        "correct_answer": "2",
        "question_notes": "The correct answer is that <b>contraception is needed until 12 months after her last period</b>. According to the UK guidelines, women aged 50 years and older should continue using contraception until they have been amenorrhoeic for at least 12 consecutive months. This is because the menopause cannot be confirmed until a woman has not had a period for one year. In this case, the patient's last period was 7 months ago, so she still requires contraception to prevent unintended pregnancy.<br /><br />The option stating <b>she no longer requires contraception</b> is incorrect because the patient has not yet met the criteria of being amenorrhoeic for 12 consecutive months. It would be premature to assume that she has completed the menopause and no longer needs contraception.<br /><br />The option suggesting <b>contraception is needed until 36 months after her last period</b> is also incorrect as it significantly exceeds the recommended duration of contraceptive use post-menopause according to UK guidelines. Continuing contraception for such an extended period may expose the patient to unnecessary side effects and risks associated with long-term contraceptive use.<br /><br />Similarly, the options stating <b>contraception is needed until 18 months after her last period</b> and <b>contraception is needed until 24 months after her last period</b> are both incorrect as they exceed the recommended duration of contraceptive use in postmenopausal women according to UK guidelines. The appropriate advice for this patient would be to continue using contraception until she reaches 12 consecutive months without a menstrual period.",

            "The correct answer is <b>Diltiazem</b>. Diltiazem, a calcium channel blocker, significantly reduces the renal and non-renal clearance of digoxin, leading to increased serum digoxin concentrations. This interaction occurs because diltiazem inhibits P-glycoprotein, a transport protein responsible for digoxin efflux. Additionally, diltiazem can reduce digoxin secretion in the renal tubules. The combination of these mechanisms can result in digoxin levels rising by 20-50%, potentially leading to toxicity, particularly in elderly patients who may already have reduced renal function.<br /><br /><b>Doxycycline</b> is incorrect. While doxycycline can interact with some medications, it does not significantly affect digoxin metabolism or clearance. The primary interaction concerns with doxycycline relate to its chelation with divalent cations and its effects on oral contraceptive efficacy.<br /><br /><b>Aspirin</b> is incorrect. At normal therapeutic doses, aspirin does not significantly interact with digoxin. While high-dose aspirin therapy can affect renal function, which could theoretically impact digoxin levels, this is not a clinically significant interaction at standard doses.<br /><br /><b>Atorvastatin</b> is incorrect.

            "The correct answer is <b>Sildenafil</b>. Sildenafil, a phosphodiesterase type 5 (PDE5) inhibitor, is commonly used for the treatment of erectile dysfunction. One of its side effects is visual disturbances, which can include cyanopsia - a blue tinge to the vision. This occurs due to the drug's effect on PDE6 enzyme found in retinal photoreceptor cells, leading to increased sensitivity to light and altered colour perception.<br /><br /><b>Phenytoin</b> is an antiepileptic medication that works by stabilizing neuronal membranes and decreasing electrical conductance among brain cells. Although it has numerous side effects, such as gingival hyperplasia, hirsutism, and cerebellar ataxia, it does not typically cause visual disturbances like a blue tinge to the vision.<br /><br /><b>Metformin</b> is a first-line oral hypoglycemic agent used in the management of type 2 diabetes mellitus. It works by decreasing hepatic glucose production and increasing insulin sensitivity in peripheral tissues. Common side effects include gastrointestinal symptoms like diarrhoea and abdominal pain; however, it does not cause visual disturbances.<br /><br /><b>Pioglitazone</b> is another oral hypoglycemic agent used in the treatment of type 2 diabetes mellitus. It belongs to the class of thiazolidinediones and acts as an agonist for peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-gamma (PPAR-\u00ce\u00b3), improving insulin sensitivity in adipose tissue, skeletal muscle, and liver. Its side effects include fluid retention, weight gain, and an increased risk of heart failure but do not involve visual disturbances.<br /><br />Finally, <b>Digoxin</b> is a cardiac glycoside used for rate control in atrial fibrillation and management of heart failure. Its mechanism involves the inhibition of sodium-potassium ATPase, leading to an increase in intracellular calcium and enhanced cardiac contractility. Although it can cause visual disturbances such as blurry vision, halos around lights, and yellow-green colour perception (xanthopsia), it does not typically cause a blue tinge to the vision.",

        "question": "A 59-year-old man with a known history of type 2 diabetes mellitus, atrial fibrillation and epilepsy presents as he is feeling generally unwell. His main complaint is a blue tinge to his vision. Which one of his medications is most likely to be responsible?",
        "correct_answer": "3",
        "question_notes": "The correct answer is <b>Sildenafil</b>. Sildenafil, a phosphodiesterase type 5 (PDE5) inhibitor, is commonly used for the treatment of erectile dysfunction. One of its side effects is visual disturbances, which can include cyanopsia - a blue tinge to the vision. This occurs due to the drug's effect on PDE6 enzyme found in retinal photoreceptor cells, leading to increased sensitivity to light and altered colour perception.<br /><br /><b>Phenytoin</b> is an antiepileptic medication that works by stabilizing neuronal membranes and decreasing electrical conductance among brain cells. Although it has numerous side effects, such as gingival hyperplasia, hirsutism, and cerebellar ataxia, it does not typically cause visual disturbances like a blue tinge to the vision.<br /><br /><b>Metformin</b> is a first-line oral hypoglycemic agent used in the management of type 2 diabetes mellitus. It works by decreasing hepatic glucose production and increasing insulin sensitivity in peripheral tissues. Common side effects include gastrointestinal symptoms like diarrhoea and abdominal pain; however, it does not cause visual disturbances.<br /><br /><b>Pioglitazone</b> is another oral hypoglycemic agent used in the treatment of type 2 diabetes mellitus. It belongs to the class of thiazolidinediones and acts as an agonist for peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-gamma (PPAR-\u00ce\u00b3), improving insulin sensitivity in adipose tissue, skeletal muscle, and liver. Its side effects include fluid retention, weight gain, and an increased risk of heart failure but do not involve visual disturbances.<br /><br />Finally, <b>Digoxin</b> is a cardiac glycoside used for rate control in atrial fibrillation and management of heart failure. Its mechanism involves the inhibition of sodium-potassium ATPase, leading to an increase in intracellular calcium and enhanced cardiac contractility. Although it can cause visual disturbances such as blurry vision, halos around lights, and yellow-green colour perception (xanthopsia), it does not typically cause a blue tinge to the vision.",

According to WHO criteria for the diagnosis of diabetes and intermediate hyperglycaemia, impaired glucose tolerance (IGT) is defined as a fasting plasma glucose (FPG) < 7.0 mmol/L and a 2-hour plasma glucose during the 75g oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT) of \u2265 7.8 and < 11.1 mmol/L. This patient's results show a fasting glucose of 5.9 mmol/L (below the 7.0 mmol/L threshold for diabetes) and a 2-hour glucose of 8.4 mmol/L, which falls within the range for IGT (\u2265 7.8 and < 11.1 mmol/L). IGT represents an intermediate state of abnormal glucose regulation that is associated with an increased risk of developing type 2 diabetes and cardiovascular disease.<br /><br /><b>Impaired fasting glucose and impaired glucose tolerance</b> is incorrect because this patient does not have impaired fasting glucose (IFG). IFG is defined as a fasting plasma glucose of 6.1-6.9 mmol/L (WHO criteria). This patient's fasting glucose is 5.9 mmol/L, which is below the threshold for IFG. Therefore, while she does have IGT, she does not have both conditions simultaneously.<br /><br /><b>Normal</b> is incorrect because the 2-hour glucose value of 8.4 mmol/L is above the normal threshold of 7.8 mmol/L. Normal glucose tolerance is defined as a fasting plasma glucose < 6.1 mmol/L and a 2-hour plasma glucose < 7.8 mmol/L. While this patient's fasting glucose is within normal limits, her 2-hour value indicates IGT.<br /><br /><b>Diabetes mellitus</b> is incorrect because neither the fasting nor the 2-hour glucose values meet the diagnostic criteria for diabetes.

            "The correct answer is: <b>Take at least 30 minutes before breakfast with plenty of water + sit-upright for 30 minutes following</b>. Alendronate is a bisphosphonate used in the treatment of osteoporosis. It has poor oral bioavailability, which can be further reduced by food or drink (other than plain water). The absorption of alendronate is best when taken on an empty stomach, at least 30 minutes before the first food or drink of the day. Furthermore, due to its potential for causing oesophageal irritation and ulceration, it is recommended that patients remain upright (sitting or standing) for at least 30 minutes after ingestion to facilitate passage through the oesophagus.<br /><br /><b>Take it on a full stomach to minimise gastric irritation and avoid lying down for 30 minutes afterwards</b>: This statement is incorrect because taking alendronate with food significantly decreases its absorption. While avoiding lying down for 30 minutes afterwards is correct, it should be taken on an empty stomach.<br /><br /><b>Dissolve tablet in water and take just before breakfast + sit-upright for 30 minutes following</b>: This statement is incorrect as alendronate tablets should not be dissolved in water before consumption. They must be swallowed whole with plenty of water to avoid oesophageal irritation.<br /><br /><b>Take during main evening meal + sit-upright for 2 hours following</b>: This statement is incorrect because taking alendronate during meals reduces its absorption. Although remaining upright for two hours would not cause harm, UK guidelines recommend remaining upright for only 30 minutes post-ingestion.<br /><br /><b>Take at least 30 minutes after a main meal + sit-upright for 30 minutes following</b>: This statement is incorrect as taking alendronate after meals will reduce its absorption.

            "<b>Topical fluorouracil cream</b> is the most appropriate initial management for these multiple actinic keratoses. This patient presents with classic features of actinic keratoses: small, rough-textured lesions with adherent scale on sun-exposed areas (temples and forehead) in someone with significant cumulative sun exposure. Fluorouracil cream is a highly effective first-line treatment for multiple actinic keratoses, typically used as a 2-3 week course. It works as a topical chemotherapy agent that selectively destroys dysplastic keratinocytes. Patients should be warned that the treated area will become red and inflamed during treatment, which indicates the medication is working. Sometimes topical hydrocortisone is prescribed following the fluorouracil course to help settle the inflammation. The treatment is particularly suitable for field treatment when multiple lesions are present, as in this case. Sun protection advice should also be given alongside treatment to prevent further lesions developing.<br /><br /><b>Topical diclofenac</b> is a treatment option for actinic keratoses but is generally reserved for mild cases. Whilst it has the advantage of causing fewer side-effects than fluorouracil, it has moderate efficacy and would not be the optimal first-line choice for this patient who has multiple lesions. Diclofenac works through its anti-inflammatory and pro-apoptotic effects on dysplastic cells, but the treatment course is longer (typically 60-90 days) and the success rate is lower than fluorouracil.<br /><br /><b>Urgent dermatology referral</b> is not indicated in this straightforward case of actinic keratoses. These are premalignant lesions that can be managed appropriately in primary care. Referral would be appropriate if there were features suggesting progression to squamous cell carcinoma (such as rapid growth, ulceration, bleeding, or induration), if the diagnosis were uncertain, or if primary care treatments had failed. The lesions described are typical actinic keratoses without concerning features.<br /><br /><b>Curettage and cautery</b> is a treatment option for actinic keratoses but is typically reserved for individual thick or hyperkeratotic lesions rather than as first-line treatment for multiple thin lesions.

        "question": "A 68-year-old retired builder attends for a routine health check. He mentions occasional itching on his scalp. Examination reveals several small, rough-textured lesions on the temples and forehead. The lesions are erythematous with adherent scale. He has worked outdoors for 40 years and rarely wore a hat. His past medical history includes hypertension.<br /><br />What is the most appropriate initial management?",
        "correct_answer": "1",
        "question_notes": "<b>Topical fluorouracil cream</b> is the most appropriate initial management for these multiple actinic keratoses. This patient presents with classic features of actinic keratoses: small, rough-textured lesions with adherent scale on sun-exposed areas (temples and forehead) in someone with significant cumulative sun exposure. Fluorouracil cream is a highly effective first-line treatment for multiple actinic keratoses, typically used as a 2-3 week course. It works as a topical chemotherapy agent that selectively destroys dysplastic keratinocytes. Patients should be warned that the treated area will become red and inflamed during treatment, which indicates the medication is working. Sometimes topical hydrocortisone is prescribed following the fluorouracil course to help settle the inflammation. The treatment is particularly suitable for field treatment when multiple lesions are present, as in this case. Sun protection advice should also be given alongside treatment to prevent further lesions developing.<br /><br /><b>Topical diclofenac</b> is a treatment option for actinic keratoses but is generally reserved for mild cases. Whilst it has the advantage of causing fewer side-effects than fluorouracil, it has moderate efficacy and would not be the optimal first-line choice for this patient who has multiple lesions. Diclofenac works through its anti-inflammatory and pro-apoptotic effects on dysplastic cells, but the treatment course is longer (typically 60-90 days) and the success rate is lower than fluorouracil.<br /><br /><b>Urgent dermatology referral</b> is not indicated in this straightforward case of actinic keratoses. These are premalignant lesions that can be managed appropriately in primary care. Referral would be appropriate if there were features suggesting progression to squamous cell carcinoma (such as rapid growth, ulceration, bleeding, or induration), if the diagnosis were uncertain, or if primary care treatments had failed. The lesions described are typical actinic keratoses without concerning features.<br /><br /><b>Curettage and cautery</b> is a treatment option for actinic keratoses but is typically reserved for individual thick or hyperkeratotic lesions rather than as first-line treatment for multiple thin lesions. This destructive method is more invasive than topical treatments and would require multiple procedures given the number of lesions present. It may be considered if topical treatments fail or for particularly resistant individual lesions, but topical field treatment is more practical when multiple lesions are present.<br /><br /><b>Reassurance and sun protection advice only</b> would be inadequate management.
