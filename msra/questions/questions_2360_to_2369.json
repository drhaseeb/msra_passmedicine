            "<b>Urgent surgical referral for debridement</b> is the correct answer. This patient presents with clinical features highly suggestive of necrotising fasciitis affecting the perineum (Fournier's gangrene). Key features include severe pain disproportionate to physical findings, rapid progression, marked tenderness with hypoaesthesia to light touch, and significant risk factors including diabetes mellitus and SGLT-2 inhibitor use (dapagliflozin). SGLT-2 inhibitors increase the risk of necrotising fasciitis, particularly affecting the perineum. This is a life-threatening surgical emergency requiring immediate surgical debridement alongside broad-spectrum intravenous antibiotics. Any delay in surgical intervention significantly increases mortality, which averages 20% even with prompt treatment. The combination of severe pain, reduced sensation, and rapid progression in a high-risk patient should trigger immediate surgical referral rather than waiting for imaging or attempting medical management alone.<br /><br /><b>Intravenous flucloxacillin</b> would be inappropriate as monotherapy. While antibiotics are essential in managing necrotising fasciitis, they must be broad-spectrum to cover mixed aerobic and anaerobic organisms (type 1 necrotising fasciitis being most common). Flucloxacillin alone provides inadequate coverage and, crucially, antibiotics without urgent surgical debridement will not control this rapidly progressive infection. The primary treatment is surgical, with antibiotics as an important adjunct.<br /><br /><b>Oral co-amoxiclav and referral to outpatient gynaecology</b> represents dangerous under-treatment of this surgical emergency.

        "question": "A 58-year-old woman with type 2 diabetes presents to the Emergency Department with a 2-day history of perineal pain and swelling. She reports the pain is severe and worsening rapidly. Examination reveals erythema and marked tenderness with reduced sensation to light touch in the affected area. She takes metformin and dapagliflozin.<br /><br />Select the single most appropriate immediate management from the options below.",
        "correct_answer": "4",
        "question_notes": "<b>Urgent surgical referral for debridement</b> is the correct answer. This patient presents with clinical features highly suggestive of necrotising fasciitis affecting the perineum (Fournier's gangrene). Key features include severe pain disproportionate to physical findings, rapid progression, marked tenderness with hypoaesthesia to light touch, and significant risk factors including diabetes mellitus and SGLT-2 inhibitor use (dapagliflozin). SGLT-2 inhibitors increase the risk of necrotising fasciitis, particularly affecting the perineum. This is a life-threatening surgical emergency requiring immediate surgical debridement alongside broad-spectrum intravenous antibiotics. Any delay in surgical intervention significantly increases mortality, which averages 20% even with prompt treatment. The combination of severe pain, reduced sensation, and rapid progression in a high-risk patient should trigger immediate surgical referral rather than waiting for imaging or attempting medical management alone.<br /><br /><b>Intravenous flucloxacillin</b> would be inappropriate as monotherapy. While antibiotics are essential in managing necrotising fasciitis, they must be broad-spectrum to cover mixed aerobic and anaerobic organisms (type 1 necrotising fasciitis being most common). Flucloxacillin alone provides inadequate coverage and, crucially, antibiotics without urgent surgical debridement will not control this rapidly progressive infection. The primary treatment is surgical, with antibiotics as an important adjunct.<br /><br /><b>Oral co-amoxiclav and referral to outpatient gynaecology</b> represents dangerous under-treatment of this surgical emergency. The severity of symptoms, rapid progression, and clinical findings of hypoaesthesia indicate deep tissue infection requiring immediate intervention. Outpatient management with oral antibiotics would be entirely inadequate and could result in rapid deterioration, sepsis, and death.

It can be a primary infection or a complication of an existing skin condition such as eczema (in this case), scabies or insect bites. Impetigo is common in children, particularly during warm weather.<br /><br />The infection can develop anywhere on the body but lesions tend to occur on the face, flexures and limbs not covered by clothing.<br /><br />Spread is by direct contact with discharges from the scabs of an infected person. The bacteria invade the skin through minor abrasions and then spread to other sites by scratching. Infection is spread mainly by the hands, but indirect spread via toys, clothing, equipment and the environment may occur.

            "The correct answer is <b>blurred vision + dry mouth</b>. Tricyclic antidepressants (TCAs) like imipramine have strong anticholinergic effects due to their antagonism of muscarinic receptors. This anticholinergic activity leads to several characteristic side effects, with dry mouth (xerostomia) and blurred vision being amongst the most common. The blurred vision occurs due to paralysis of accommodation in the eye, whilst the dry mouth is due to reduced saliva production. These effects are predictable and commonly seen together in patients taking TCAs.<br /><br /><b>Dry mouth + urinary frequency</b> is incorrect because whilst dry mouth is a typical anticholinergic side effect of TCAs, urinary frequency is not. In fact, TCAs typically cause urinary retention rather than frequency due to their anticholinergic effects on the bladder.<br /><br /><b>Hypertension + sweating</b> is incorrect. While TCAs can cause sweating as a side effect due to their effects on noradrenergic transmission, they typically cause postural hypotension rather than hypertension due to their alpha-1 adrenergic blocking properties.<br /><br /><b>Gastrointestinal bleeding + dyspepsia</b> is incorrect. These side effects are more commonly associated with selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) due to their effects on platelet function and gastric acid secretion. TCAs are not particularly associated with these adverse effects.<br /><br /><b>Headache + myoclonus</b> is incorrect. While headaches can occur with TCAs, myoclonus is more commonly associated with SSRIs and serotonin syndrome. These symptoms are not typically seen together as characteristic side effects of TCAs.",

            "The correct answer in this case is <b>recent rifampicin as she was a contact of a patient with meningococcal meningitis</b>. Rifampicin is a potent inducer of the cytochrome P450 enzyme system, which is responsible for the metabolism of warfarin. This induction leads to an increased clearance of warfarin and thus, a decreased INR. In this scenario, the patient's INR has dropped below the therapeutic range due to her recent use of rifampicin.<br /><br /><b>Starting fluoxetine for depression</b> would not typically cause a decrease in INR. Fluoxetine is an SSRI antidepressant that can interact with warfarin, but it usually causes an increase in INR rather than a decrease because it inhibits the metabolism of warfarin through the cytochrome P450 enzyme system.<br /><br /><b>The formation of lupus anticoagulant autoantibodies</b> could lead to an elevated risk of thrombotic events but would not directly impact the INR value. Lupus anticoagulant autoantibodies interfere with phospholipid-dependent coagulation tests, such as activated partial thromboplastin time (aPTT), but they do not affect prothrombin time or INR.<br /><br /><b>Giving up smoking</b> may have some effect on drug metabolism through changes in hepatic enzymes; however, these effects are generally minor and would not be expected to cause such a significant drop in INR. The impact of smoking cessation on warfarin pharmacokinetics is variable and inconsistent.<br /><br />Lastly, <b>a course of ciprofloxacin for a urinary tract infection</b> might have some interaction with warfarin, but it would more likely lead to an increase in INR rather than a decrease. Ciprofloxacin is a fluoroquinolone antibiotic that can inhibit the metabolism of warfarin, leading to increased levels of warfarin and a higher INR. This interaction is less potent compared to other fluoroquinolones like levofloxacin.",

This is usually accompanied by colour fundus photography to provide a baseline against which changes can be identified over time.</li><li>fluorescein angiography is utilised if neovascular ARMD is suspected, as this can guide intervention with anti-VEGF therapy. This may be complemented with indocyanine green angiography to visualise any changes in the choroidal circulation. </li><li>optical coherence tomography is used to visualise the retina in three dimensions because it can reveal areas of disease which aren't visible using microscopy alone. </li></ul><br /><h5 class='notes-heading'>Management</h5><br />Treatment<br /><ul><li>the AREDS trial examined the treatment of dry ARMD in 3640 subjects. It showed that a combination of zinc with anti-oxidant vitamins A,C and E reduced progression of the disease by around one third.
