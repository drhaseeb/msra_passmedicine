            "The correct answer is <b>Molluscum contagiosum</b>. Molluscum contagiosum is a common viral skin infection caused by the molluscum contagiosum virus (MCV). It presents as multiple small, raised, flesh-coloured or pearly white papules with a central dimple (umbilication). It usually affects children and spreads through direct skin-to-skin contact or via fomites.<br /><br /><b>Roseola infantum</b> is incorrect because it is a childhood exanthem caused by human herpesvirus 6 (HHV-6) or human herpesvirus 7 (HHV-7). It typically presents with high fever for 3-5 days followed by the appearance of a pink, maculopapular rash that starts on the trunk and spreads to the extremities. The rash does not have any central dimpling.<br /><br /><b>Kawasaki disease</b> is an incorrect option as it is a systemic vasculitis affecting medium-sized arteries in children. Its clinical features include fever lasting more than five days, bilateral non-exudative conjunctivitis, erythema of oral mucosa and lips, cervical lymphadenopathy, polymorphous rash, and swelling or redness of hands and feet. The rash in Kawasaki disease can be variable but does not present with umbilicated papules.<br /><br /><b>Viral warts</b>, also known as verrucae, are caused by human papillomavirus (HPV) infection. They present as firm hyperkeratotic papules with rough surfaces but do not have central dimpling like molluscum contagiosum lesions.<br /><br />Lastly, <b>Pityriasis rosea</b> is an incorrect choice because it is a self-limiting skin condition characterized by the appearance of an initial herald patch followed by smaller oval scaly lesions distributed along the lines of skin tension (Christmas tree pattern). The rash is usually pink or salmon-coloured and does not present with central dimpling.",

        "body": "Molluscum contagiosum is a common skin infection caused by molluscum contagiosum virus (MCV), a member of the <span class=\"concept\" data-cid=\"11963\">Poxviridae family</span>. Transmission occurs directly by close personal contact, or indirectly via fomites (contaminated surfaces) such as shared towels and flannels. The majority of cases occur in children (often in children with atopic eczema), with the maximum incidence in preschool children aged 1-4 years.<br /><br />Typically, molluscum contagiosum presents with characteristic pinkish or pearly white papules with a central umbilication, which are up to 5 mm in diameter. Lesions appear in clusters in areas anywhere on the body (except the palms of the hands and the soles of the feet). In children, lesions are commonly seen on the trunk and in flexures, but anogenital lesions may also occur. In adults, sexual contact may lead to lesions developing on the genitalia, pubis, thighs, and lower abdomen. Rarely, lesions can occur on the oral mucosa and on the eyelids.<br /><br /><div class=\"container\"><div class=\"row\"><div class=\"col-md-3\"><a href=\"https://d32xxyeh8kfs8k.cloudfront.net/images_Passmedicine/dsd121b.jpg\" data-fancybox=\"gallery\" data-caption=\"Molluscum contagiosum .

            "The correct answer is <b>Kallman's syndrome</b>. This rare genetic condition primarily affects the development of the hypothalamic-pituitary axis, leading to hypogonadotropic hypogonadism and anosmia. Whilst it can cause some craniofacial abnormalities, it is not typically associated with upper airway obstruction or snoring in children. The condition primarily manifests during adolescence when patients fail to enter puberty.<br /><br /><b>Hypertrophic nasal turbinates</b> are a common cause of snoring in children. The enlarged turbinates narrow the nasal airway, increasing airflow resistance and creating turbulent airflow. This leads to the characteristic sound of snoring during sleep and can contribute to sleep-disordered breathing.<br /><br /><b>Tonsillitis</b>, particularly when chronic or recurrent, can lead to tonsillar hypertrophy. Enlarged tonsils narrow the oropharyngeal airway, causing obstruction during sleep and resulting in snoring. This is one of the most common causes of sleep-disordered breathing in children and may warrant tonsillectomy if significantly affecting sleep quality.<br /><br /><b>Obesity</b> is a significant contributor to snoring in children. Excess adipose tissue in the neck and pharyngeal region narrows the upper airway and increases the likelihood of partial airway collapse during sleep. The prevalence of snoring and sleep-disordered breathing is markedly higher in obese children.<br /><br /><b>Down's syndrome</b> is commonly associated with snoring due to several anatomical features including macroglossia, midface hypoplasia, and generalised hypotonia. These children often have a relatively narrow upper airway and are prone to adenotonsillar hypertrophy, all of which contribute to their increased risk of sleep-disordered breathing and snoring.",

        "body": "VTEs can cause severe morbidity and mortality, but they are preventable. Current NICE guidelines (updated for 2018) outline recommendations for assessment and management of patients at risk of VTE in hospital. <br /><br /><br /><h5 class='notes-heading'>Risk factors</h5><br />All patients admitted to hospital should be individually assessed to identify risk factors for VTE development and bleeding risk. For medical and surgical patients the recommended risk proforma is the department of healths VTE risk assessment tool.<br /><br />The following inpatients would be deemed at increased risk of developing a VTE:<br /><br />Medical patients:<br /><ul><li>significant reduction in mobility for 3 days or more (or anticipated to have significantly reduced mobility)</li></ul><br />Surgical/trauma patients:<br /><ul><li>hip/knee replacement</li><li>hip fracture</li><li>general anaesthetic and a surgical duration of over 90 minutes</li><li>surgery of the pelvis or lower limb with a general anaesthetic and a surgical duration of over 60 minutes</li><li>acute surgical admission with an inflammatory/intra-abdominal condition</li><li>surgery with a significant reduction in mobility</li></ul><br />General risk factors:<br /><ul><li>active cancer/chemotherapy</li><li>aged over 60</li><li>known blood clotting disorder (e.g. thrombophilia)</li><li>BMI over 35</li><li>dehydration</li><li>one or more significant medical comorbidities (e.g. heart disease; metabolic/endocrine pathologies; respiratory disease; acute infectious disease and inflammatory conditions)</li><li>critical care admission</li><li>use of hormone replacement therapy (HRT)</li><li>use of the combined oral contraceptive pill</li><li>varicose veins</li><li>pregnant or less than 6 weeks post-partum</li></ul><br />After a patients VTE risk has been assessed, this should be compared to their risk of bleeding to decide whether VTE prophylaxis should be offered. If indicated VTE prophylaxis should be started as soon as possible. <br /><br /><br /><h5 class='notes-heading'>Types of VTE prophylaxis</h5><br />Mechanical:<br /><ul><li>Correctly fitted anti-embolism (aka compression) stockings (thigh or knee height)</li><li>An Intermittent pneumatic compression device</li></ul><br />Pharmacological:<br /><ul><li>Fondaparinux sodium (SC injection)</li><li>Low molecular weight heparin (LMWH)<ul><li>e.g. enoxaparin</li><li>reduced doses should be used in patients with severe renal impairment</li></ul></li><li>Unfractionated heparin (UFH)<ul><li>used as an alternative to LWMH in patients with chronic kidney disease</li></ul></li></ul><br /><br /><h5 class='notes-heading'>Management</h5><br />In general, all medical patients deemed at risk of VTE after individual assessment are started on pharmacological VTE prophylaxis. This is providing the risk of VTE outweighs the risk of bleeding (this is often a clinical judgement) and there are no contraindications. Those at very high risk may be offered anti-embolic stockings alongside the pharmacological methods. <br /><br />For surgical patients at low risk of VTE first-line treatment is anti-embolism stockings. If a patient is at high risk these stockings are used in conjunction with pharmacological prophylaxis. <br /><br /><br /><h5 class='notes-heading'>Advice for patients</h5><br />Pre-surgical interventions:<br /><ul><li><span class=\"concept\" data-cid=\"11411\">Advise women to stop taking their combined oral contraceptive pill/hormone replacement therapy 4 weeks before surgery</span></li></ul><br />Post-surgical interventions: <br /><ul><li>Try to mobilise patients as soon as possible after surgery </li><li>Ensure the patient is hydrated</li></ul><br /><br /><h5 class='notes-heading'>Post procedure prophylaxis</h5><br />For certain surgical procedures (hip and knee replacements) pharmacological VTE prophylaxis is recommended for all patients to reduce the risk of a VTE developing post-surgery. NICE make the following recommendations:<br /><br /><div class=\"table-responsive\"><table class = \"tlarge table table-striped table-bordered\"  data-role=\"table\" id=\"tableid1\" ><thead><tr><th><b>Procedure</b></th><th><b>Prophylaxis</b></th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Elective hip</td><td>LMWH for 10 days followed by aspirin (75 or 150 mg) for a further 28 days<br /><br />or<br /><br />LMWH for 28 days combined with anti-embolism stockings until discharge<br /><br />or<br /><br />Rivaroxaban</td></tr><tr><td>Elective knee</td><td>Aspirin (75 or 150 mg) for 14 days<br /><br />or<br /><br />LMWH for 14 days combined with anti-embolism stockings until discharge<br /><br />or<br /><br />Rivaroxaban</td></tr><tr><td>Fragility fractures of the pelvis, hip and proximal femur</td><td>The NICE guidance states the following (our bolding):<br /><br /><div class='bs-callout bs-callout-default'><i><br />Offer VTE prophylaxis for a <b>month</b> to people with fragility fractures of the pelvis, hip or proximal<br />femur if the risk of VTE outweighs the risk of bleeding.
