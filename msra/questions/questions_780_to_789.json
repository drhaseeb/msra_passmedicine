            "<b>Breast development</b> is indeed the first sign of puberty in girls. This initial stage of breast development, known as thelarche, typically begins between the ages of 8-13 years and represents the earliest visible manifestation of pubertal development in females. Thelarche corresponds to Tanner stage 2 breast development, characterised by breast budding with elevation of the breast and papilla as a small mound, and enlargement of the areolar diameter. This occurs due to the activation of the hypothalamic-pituitary-gonadal axis, resulting in increased oestrogen production which stimulates breast tissue growth. The mean age for thelarche in the UK is approximately 10.5 years, though this can vary based on genetic, nutritional, and environmental factors.<br /><br /><b>Development of pubic hair</b> is not the first sign of puberty in girls. Pubarche (the development of pubic hair) typically follows thelarche by about 6 months, though in some girls they may appear to occur simultaneously. Pubic hair development is primarily driven by adrenal androgens rather than gonadal hormones, as part of a process called adrenarche. It represents Tanner stage 2 pubic hair development, characterised by sparse growth of long, slightly pigmented, downy hair, straight or only slightly curly, appearing mainly on the labia.<br /><br /><b>Menstrual bleeding</b> (menarche) occurs relatively late in the pubertal sequence, typically about 2-3 years after the onset of breast development. The mean age of menarche in the UK is approximately 12.9 years. Menarche generally occurs after significant breast development (usually Tanner stage 3-4) and after the peak height velocity has been reached. It represents the maturation of the hypothalamic-pituitary-ovarian axis and the establishment of regular ovulatory cycles, though early menstrual cycles are often anovulatory.<br /><br /><b>Development of axillary hair</b> occurs later in the pubertal sequence, typically after both breast and pubic hair development have begun. Like pubic hair, axillary hair development is primarily driven by adrenal androgens. It usually appears approximately 1-2 years after the onset of pubic hair development, making it a relatively late sign of puberty.<br /><br /><b>Height spurt</b> in girls typically begins early in puberty but is not the first visible sign. The pubertal growth spurt in females usually starts shortly after breast development begins and reaches its peak velocity at approximately Tanner stage 2-3 of breast development. The timing differs from boys, whose growth spurt occurs later in their pubertal development. In girls, the growth spurt is often well underway before menarche occurs, and growth typically slows significantly after menarche, with only about 2-3 cm of height gained post-menarche in most girls.",

            "The correct answer is <b>Erythromycin</b>. Erythromycin is a macrolide antibiotic that has been associated with cardiotoxicity, specifically QT interval prolongation and ventricular arrhythmias such as torsades de pointes. This makes it a high-risk medication for patients with Long QT syndrome, who already have an increased risk of these complications. The UK Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA) recommends caution when prescribing drugs known to have this side effect to patients with existing QT interval prolongation.<br /><br /><b>Doxycycline</b> is a tetracycline antibiotic and there are no major concerns about its use in patients with Long QT syndrome. While any medication can potentially cause side effects, doxycycline is not generally associated with significant cardiac risks.<br /><br /><b>Trimethoprim</b> is an antibiotic often used for urinary tract infections. It does not typically affect the QT interval significantly and hence is considered safe for use in patients with Long QT syndrome.<br /><br /><b>Rifampicin</b> is an antibiotic commonly used in the treatment of tuberculosis. It's also not known to prolong the QT interval or induce ventricular arrhythmias, making it safe for use in these patients.<br /><br />Finally, <b>Co-amoxiclav</b>, a combination of amoxicillin and clavulanic acid, is also not associated with significant cardiotoxicity or QT interval prolongation. Therefore, it too would be considered safe for use in a patient with Long QT syndrome.<br /><br />In conclusion, while all antibiotics can potentially cause side effects, erythromycin poses a specific risk to those with Long QT syndrome due to its potential to further prolong the QT interval and increase the risk of life-threatening ventricular arrhythmias.",

            "The correct answer is <b>7 days</b>. The Mirena intrauterine system (IUS) is a levonorgestrel-releasing intrauterine device that provides effective contraception. When inserted on day 12 of the menstrual cycle, which is potentially close to ovulation in a standard 28-day cycle, it takes 7 days for the Mirena to provide reliable contraception. This is because the Mirena works primarily by thickening cervical mucus and thinning the endometrial lining, and these effects take time to develop. During these 7 days, additional contraceptive methods should be used to prevent pregnancy. This guidance is in accordance with the Faculty of Sexual and Reproductive Healthcare (FSRH) recommendations in the UK.<br /><br /><b>Immediately</b> is incorrect. The Mirena IUS can only be relied upon for immediate contraception if it is inserted within the first 7 days of the menstrual cycle, when the risk of ovulation is low.

This timeframe is too short for the Mirena to establish reliable contraceptive effects when inserted on day 12 of the cycle.

This patient with metastatic prostate cancer has tingling sensations, muscle spasms and aches, and nausea and vomiting, which are suggestive of <b>hypocalcaemia</b>. Symptomatic hypocalcaemia after starting a bisphosphonate such as zoledronic acid is often due to an <i>underlying vitamin D or calcium deficiency</i>. The administration of zoledronic acid reduces bone turnover, in turn reducing the amount of calcium provided to the blood calcium pool from bone stores. A calcium or vitamin D deficiency leads to reduced serum calcium availability, which is exaggerated by the administration of bisphosphonates.<br /><br />The remaining options are incorrect.<br /><br /><b>Hypercalcaemia</b> is incorrect. Although it can also present with similar symptoms to hypocalcaemia, it would be unlikely to occur soon after the administration of a bisphosphonate.<br /><br /><b>Hyperkalaemia</b> is incorrect.

Three days after the administration of the drug, the patient presents to the emergency department with body aches, muscle spasms, and tingling around his lips. The patient also mentioned that nausea and vomiting started the day after the infusion which has since worsened. <br /><br />What will serum studies likely show in this patient?",
        "correct_answer": "4",
        "question_notes": "<b>Hypocalcaemia</b> is the correct option. This patient with metastatic prostate cancer has tingling sensations, muscle spasms and aches, and nausea and vomiting, which are suggestive of <b>hypocalcaemia</b>. Symptomatic hypocalcaemia after starting a bisphosphonate such as zoledronic acid is often due to an <i>underlying vitamin D or calcium deficiency</i>. The administration of zoledronic acid reduces bone turnover, in turn reducing the amount of calcium provided to the blood calcium pool from bone stores. A calcium or vitamin D deficiency leads to reduced serum calcium availability, which is exaggerated by the administration of bisphosphonates.<br /><br />The remaining options are incorrect.<br /><br /><b>Hypercalcaemia</b> is incorrect. Although it can also present with similar symptoms to hypocalcaemia, it would be unlikely to occur soon after the administration of a bisphosphonate.<br /><br /><b>Hyperkalaemia</b> is incorrect. Although it can also present with weakness and palpitations along with diarrhoea and nausea/vomiting, it would again be unlikely to occur in response to bisphosphonate therapy.<br /><br /><b>Hypernatraemia</b> is incorrect. Patients with cancer often present with hyponatraemia, not hypernatraemia. Furthermore, it would also present with neurological symptoms, weakness, and thirst, which are not seen in this patient.<br /><br /><b>Hypokalaemia</b> is incorrect. It would present with muscle weakness, spasms, fatigue, and palpitations amongst other symptoms but is unlikely to occur in response to bisphosphonate therapy.",

            "The base of the skull is composed of 3 bony fossae: anterior, middle and posterior.  These platforms of bone support many structures which lie on the internal inferior aspect of the cranium. Consequently, if these bones are fractured, there can be damage to associated neurovascular structures. This damage may manifest externally via linked areas, e.g. the nasal cavity or the auditory canal. Bleeding from ruptured vessels can leak into the middle ear (haemotympanum) or mastoid area (Battle's sign), while ruptured CSF spaces may cause fluid to leak into the nose or auditory canal (CSF rhinorrhoea and otorrhoea). <br />Stellwag's sign is unrelated to base of skull trauma and refers to reduced blinking.<br />",
