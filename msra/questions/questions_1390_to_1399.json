            "The correct answer is <b>pulmonary fibrosis</b>. Cabergoline, a dopamine receptor agonist used in the treatment of Parkinson's disease and hyperprolactinaemia, has been associated with an increased risk of pulmonary fibrosis. This is thought to be due to the drug's action on serotonin receptors in the lung, leading to the proliferation of fibroblasts and collagen deposition. The onset can be insidious and symptoms may include dry cough, exertional dyspnoea and fatigue. It is important to monitor patients for these symptoms and consider further investigation if they occur.<br /><br /><b>Optic neuritis</b> is not a recognised side effect of cabergoline. Optic neuritis typically presents as a painful loss of vision, often associated with multiple sclerosis or other demyelinating conditions. It is not linked to dopamine receptor agonists.<br /><br />A <b>transient rise in liver function tests</b> can occur with many medications but it's not specifically related to cabergoline use. Liver function tests should be monitored regularly when starting any new medication, particularly those metabolised by the liver.<br /><br /><b>Renal failure</b> is also not associated with cabergoline use.

Again, NICE summarise the main points in terms of decision making:<br /><br /><div class=\"table-responsive\"><table class = \"tlarge table table-striped table-bordered\"  data-role=\"table\" id=\"tableid2\" ><thead><tr><th></th><th>Dopamine agonists</th><th>MAO-B inhibitors</th><th>COMT inhibitors</th><th>Amantadine</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td><b>Motor symptoms</b></td><td>Improvement in motor symptoms</td><td>Improvement in motor symptoms</td><td>Improvement in motor symptoms</td><td>No evidence of improvement in motor symptoms</td></tr><tr><td><b>Activities of daily living</b></td><td>Improvement in activities of daily living</td><td>Improvement in activities of daily living</td><td>Improvement in activities of daily living</td><td>No evidence of improvement in activities of daily living</td></tr><tr><td><b>Off time</b></td><td>More off-time reduction</td><td>Off-time reduction</td><td>Off-time reduction</td><td>No studies reporting this outcome</td></tr><tr><td><b>Adverse events</b></td><td>Intermediate risk of adverse events</td><td>Fewer adverse events</td><td>More adverse events</td><td>No studies reporting this outcome</td></tr><tr><td><b>Hallucinations</b></td><td><span class=\"concept\" data-cid=\"4334\">More risk of hallucinations</span></td><td>Lower risk of hallucinations</td><td>Lower risk of hallucinations</td><td>No studies reporting this outcome</td></tr></tbody></table></div><br /><br /><h5 class='notes-heading'>Specific points regarding Parkinson's medication</h5><br />NICE reminds us of the risk of acute akinesia or neuroleptic malignant syndrome if medication is not taken/absorbed (for example due to gastroenteritis) and advise against giving patients a 'drug holiday' for the same reason.<br /><br />Impulse control disorders have become a significant issue in recent years. These can occur with any dopaminergic therapy but are more common with:<br /><ul><li><span class=\"concept\" data-cid=\"5640\">dopamine agonist therapy</span></li><li>a history of previous impulsive behaviours</li><li>a history of alcohol consumption and/or smoking</li></ul><br />If excessive daytime sleepiness develops then patients should not drive. Medication should be adjusted to control symptoms. Modafinil can be considered if alternative strategies fail.<br /><br />If orthostatic hypotension develops then a medication review looking at potential causes should be done. If symptoms persist then midodrine (acts on peripheral alpha-adrenergic receptors to increase arterial resistance) can be considered.<br /><br /><span class=\"concept\" data-cid=\"9533\">Consider glycopyrronium bromide to manage drooling of saliva in people with Parkinson's disease.</span><br /><br /><h5 class='notes-heading'>Further information regarding specific anti-Parkinson's medication</h5><br /><br />Levodopa<br /><ul><li>nearly always combined with a decarboxylase inhibitor (e.g. carbidopa or benserazide)<ul><li>this prevents the peripheral metabolism of levodopa to dopamine outside of the brain and hence can reduce side effects</li></ul></li><li>common adverse effects: <ul><li><span class=\"concept\" data-cid=\"6272\">dry mouth</span></li><li><span class=\"concept\" data-cid=\"6273\">anorexia</span></li><li><span class=\"concept\" data-cid=\"6274\">palpitations</span></li><li><span class=\"concept\" data-cid=\"6275\">postural hypotension</span></li><li><span class=\"concept\" data-cid=\"6276\">psychosis</span></li></ul></li><li>some adverse effects are due to the difficulty in achieving a steady dose of levodopa<ul><li><span class=\"concept\" data-cid=\"11755\">end-of-dose wearing off</span>: symptoms often worsen towards the end of dosage interval.

            "The correct answer is <b>Central retinal artery occlusion</b>. This condition presents with sudden, painless, unilateral vision loss. On examination, there may be a relative afferent pupillary defect (RAPD), also known as Marcus Gunn pupil, which is an abnormal response to light in the affected eye due to a severe decrease in the number of functioning retinal ganglion cells. Fundoscopy typically reveals a pale retina with a cherry-red spot at the fovea due to obstruction of blood flow in the central retinal artery.<br /><br /><b>Central retinal vein occlusion</b> is incorrect because it presents differently. Patients often complain of sudden or gradual vision loss. On fundoscopy, there are widespread retinal haemorrhages ('blood and thunder' appearance) and cotton wool spots due to blockage of the central retinal vein leading to increased pressure and subsequent leakage from other vessels.<br /><br /><b>Subhyaloid haemorrhage</b> is also incorrect. It presents with sudden visual loss or floaters but does not typically cause RAPD. On fundoscopy, you would see a pre-retinal (subhyaloid) haemorrhage which appears as a dark red, boat-shaped mass located between the retina and vitreous humour.<br /><br />The diagnosis of <b>Solar retinopathy</b> is unlikely in this case as it results from direct solar radiation damage to the macula leading to central scotoma (blind spot). The typical fundoscopic finding is yellowish dots at the level of RPE in fovea.<br /><br />Lastly, <b>Optic neuritis</b>, commonly associated with multiple sclerosis, typically presents with painful vision loss over days accompanied by dyschromatopsia (impaired colour vision).

            "The correct answer is <b>Peripheral oedema</b>. Pioglitazone, a type of thiazolidinedione, can cause fluid retention leading to peripheral oedema. This is due to its mechanism of action where it reduces insulin resistance and thus increases glucose uptake by the adipose tissue and skeletal muscle. This leads to an increase in plasma volume, which may result in peripheral oedema. It's particularly common in patients with underlying heart failure or those using insulin concurrently.<br /><br />Discussing the other options:<br /><br /><b>Photosensitivity</b> is not typically associated with pioglitazone. Photosensitivity reactions are more commonly seen with drugs such as tetracyclines, sulphonamides, thiazide diuretics, and some non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs).<br /><br /><b>Thrombocytopaenia</b>, a condition characterised by abnormally low levels of platelets in the blood, is also not a known side effect of pioglitazone. Drugs that are more commonly associated with thrombocytopenia include heparin, quinine, sulphonamides and some anticonvulsants.<br /><br /><b>Myalgia</b>, or muscle pain, is not typically caused by pioglitazone either. Myalgia is more often associated with statins like simvastatin which this patient is also taking.<br /><br />Lastly, <b>Hyponatraemia</b>, defined as a low sodium level in the blood, is not commonly caused by pioglitazone. Hyponatraemia can be induced by many classes of medications including diuretics, antidepressants (Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors), antipsychotics and antiepileptics.",
