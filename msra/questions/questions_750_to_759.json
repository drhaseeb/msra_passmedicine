            "The correct answer is that the fluoxetine <b>should be continued for at least 6 months</b> after remission of symptoms. According to NICE guidelines, antidepressant treatment should be continued for at least 6 months after remission of a depressive episode to prevent relapse. This recommendation is based on evidence showing that continuing treatment reduces the risk of relapse by approximately 50% compared to stopping treatment immediately after remission.<br /><br /><b>Stopping straight away</b> would be inappropriate and potentially dangerous. Abrupt discontinuation of SSRIs like fluoxetine can lead to discontinuation syndrome, characterised by flu-like symptoms, sensory disturbances, and psychological symptoms. Additionally, stopping treatment too early significantly increases the risk of relapse.<br /><br /><b>Continuing for at least 6 weeks</b> is insufficient duration of treatment. While initial therapeutic response may be seen within 4-6 weeks, this is not long enough to prevent relapse. The risk of recurrence remains high if treatment is discontinued this early.<br /><br /><b>Continuing for at least 3 months</b> is also insufficient duration of treatment. Although this is longer than 6 weeks, it still falls short of the recommended minimum duration needed to effectively prevent relapse of depressive symptoms.<br /><br /><b>Continuing for at least 12 months</b> may be appropriate in some cases, particularly for patients with recurrent depression or those at high risk of relapse. However, for a first episode of depression that has responded well to treatment, 6 months continuation after remission is the standard recommendation. Extending treatment to 12 months would not be necessary for all patients and could expose them to unnecessary long-term medication use.",

            "The correct answer is <b>Akathisia</b>. Akathisia is a common side effect of antipsychotic medications, particularly those of the first generation like chlorpromazine. It is characterised by a subjective feeling of restlessness, often with an inability to sit still. The patient may pace around or constantly fidget. This condition typically occurs within the first few weeks of treatment.<br /><br /><b>Neuroleptic malignant syndrome</b> (NMS) is incorrect as this severe reaction to antipsychotics usually presents with hyperthermia, altered mental status, autonomic dysfunction and generalised muscle rigidity (often described as 'lead pipe' rigidity). Although agitation can be a feature of NMS due to the altered mental status, it would not be the sole presenting symptom.<br /><br /><b>Acute dystonia</b> is also incorrect because it refers to sudden onset involuntary muscle contractions that cause abnormal movements and postures. These can include oculogyric crisis (involuntary upward eye movement), torticollis (twisting of the neck muscles) and trismus (lockjaw). Restlessness is not characteristic.<br /><br />Similarly, <b>Tardive dyskinesia</b> doesn't fit this presentation either. This side effect generally occurs after long-term use of antipsychotic medication, typically more than 3 months. It manifests as repetitive, involuntary movements such as lip smacking or puckering, grimacing, tongue protrusion and rapid blinking.<br /><br />Lastly, <b>Parkinsonism</b> resulting from antipsychotic use would present with bradykinesia (slowness of movement), resting tremor and rigidity rather than restlessness. It's important to remember that Parkinsonism refers to conditions that exhibit symptoms similar to Parkinson's disease but are caused by other factors such as medication use or different neurological disorders.<br />",

            "The correct answer is '<b>Annual influenza + one-off pneumococcal</b>'. According to UK guidelines, patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) should receive an annual influenza vaccination and a one-off pneumococcal vaccination. The annual influenza vaccination is recommended as these patients are at higher risk of severe illness if they contract the flu. The pneumococcal vaccine is given once to protect against serious infections caused by <i>Streptococcus pneumoniae</i>, such as pneumonia, septicaemia (a kind of blood poisoning) and meningitis.<br /><br />'<b>Annual influenza + annual pneumococcal</b>' is incorrect because the pneumococcal vaccine does not need to be given annually. It's a one-off vaccination that provides long-term protection against pneumococcal infections.<br /><br />'<b>Annual influenza + one-off pneumococcal + one-off Hib booster</b>' is also incorrect. While Haemophilus Influenzae type b (Hib) can cause respiratory infections, a booster for Hib is not routinely recommended for adults or individuals with COPD in the UK.<br /><br />'<b>Annual influenza + pneumococcal every 5 years</b>' is another incorrect choice since, as mentioned earlier, the pneumococcus vaccine does not need to be repeated every five years but rather it's a single-dose lifetime vaccine.<br /><br />Finally, '<b>Annual influenza</b>' alone would not provide adequate protection for this patient group from potential bacterial infection by <i>Streptococcus pneumoniae</i>.

            "The correct answer is <b>Citalopram</b>. This patient presents with confusion and a fall, associated with significant hyponatraemia. The key information is the recent initiation of citalopram, a selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI), three weeks prior. SSRIs are a well-established cause of the Syndrome of Inappropriate Antidiuretic Hormone (SIADH), which leads to euvolaemic hyponatraemia. This risk is particularly pronounced in elderly patients. In SIADH, there is non-physiological release of ADH, leading to excessive water reabsorption in the kidneys and subsequent dilutional hyponatraemia. The patient's clinical state of euvolaemia and the laboratory findings of low sodium with normal urea and creatinine are classic for SIADH. The low urea is particularly suggestive, as it can result from the same dilutional process and increased renal excretion. The temporal association between starting the drug and the onset of symptoms makes citalopram the most probable causative agent. Management involves stopping the offending drug and, depending on severity and symptoms, fluid restriction or more active measures to correct the sodium level.<br /><br /><b>Dehydration</b> is an important cause of confusion and falls in the elderly. However, the clinical and biochemical picture is not consistent with this diagnosis. The patient is described as clinically euvolaemic, not showing signs of hypovolaemia such as tachycardia, hypotension, or dry mucous membranes. Furthermore, in dehydration (hypovolaemic hyponatraemia or hypernatraemia), you would typically expect to see a raised urea level, often disproportionately elevated compared to creatinine, due to increased passive reabsorption of urea in the proximal tubules. This patient's urea is in the low-normal range, which argues strongly against dehydration and points more towards a dilutional state like SIADH.<br /><br /><b>Urinary tract infection</b> (UTI) is a very common precipitant for delirium in older adults and must always be considered. However, there are no specific features in the history to suggest a UTI, such as dysuria, frequency, or suprapubic pain. While a UTI can sometimes cause SIADH, the direct pharmacological effect of the recently started citalopram provides a more direct and compelling explanation for the profound hyponatraemia. In the absence of other signs of infection (e.g., fever, raised inflammatory markers - though not provided), and with a clear iatrogenic cause, UTI is less likely to be the primary diagnosis.<br /><br />An <b>Intracranial bleed</b> is a critical differential diagnosis for any elderly patient presenting with confusion and a fall. The fall could have caused a bleed (e.g., subdural haematoma), or a bleed could have caused the fall and confusion. While this must be excluded, particularly with a thorough neurological examination and a low threshold for CT imaging, the profound hyponatraemia offers a strong metabolic explanation for her neurological symptoms. Severe hyponatraemia itself can cause cerebral oedema, leading to confusion, seizures, and falls. Given the clear temporal link to the new medication and the classic biochemical picture of SIADH, the drug-induced metabolic encephalopathy is the most likely primary event.<br /><br /><b>Hypothyroidism</b> can be a cause of both confusion and hyponatraemia. The mechanism is thought to be related to reduced cardiac output and glomerular filtration rate, leading to impaired free water clearance, and in severe cases, a component of SIADH. However, the development of such severe symptoms and biochemical disturbance from hypothyroidism would typically be insidious, occurring over many months or years. The acute onset of this patient's symptoms over a three-week period, coinciding perfectly with the initiation of citalopram, makes the medication a far more likely culprit than a new or acutely decompensated endocrine disorder.",
