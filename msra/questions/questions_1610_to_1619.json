            "Hypocalcaemia is a relatively common complication of chronic kidney disease. It is caused by the kidneys being unable to activate vitamin D and excrete phosphate, meaning calcium is 'used up' in calcium phosphate. This low level of calcium causes secondary hyperparathyroidism, where there is an increase in parathyroid hormone (PTH) in order to try and raise calcium levels. It does this by stimulating osteoclast activity to release more calcium, and this activity causes a rise in ALP found in bone. Therefore, the overall blood results expected are raised phosphate (due to an inability to excrete it), raised PTH (due to a reaction to hypocalcaemia) and raised ALP (due to the action of PTH).<br /><br />Normal serum phosphate, normal ALP and normal PTH are found in osteoporosis or osteopetrosis and may be associated with normal or decreased calcium. But in this case, we already know that the patient has hypocalcemia and chronic kidney disease, making us suspect that he might have other abnormal results. <br /><br />\u2191 serum phosphate, normal ALP and \u2193 PTH are found in hypoparathyroidism. PTH normally inhibits the resorption of phosphate in the kidneys, and so lowered PTH causes a rise in serum phosphate. This would not fit with chronic kidney disease, and is, therefore, an incorrect answer. <br /><br />\u2193 serum phosphate, normal ALP and normal PTH would suggest an isolated phosphate deficiency. However, this does not fit with the clinical picture of hypocalcaemia or chronic kidney disease, and is, therefore, an incorrect answer. <br /><br />\u2193 serum phosphate, \u2191 ALP and \u2191 PTH with low calcium is found in osteomalacia, which is the result of low serum vitamin D. Vitamin D is essential for the absorption of both calcium and phosphate, and therefore a lack of this will cause low serum concentrations. The low calcium level causes increased PTH activity causing bone resorption to try and compensate. ALP is increased due to this increase in bone resorption. However, a result of chronic kidney disease is more likely here and therefore this is an incorrect answer.",

            "Pompholyx eczema (also known as dyshidrotic eczema) is a type of vesicular hand dermatitis. It is more common in young adult females and is commonly related to sweating, with flares during hot weather and humid conditions. It manifests as recurrent crops of vesicles and/or blisters on the palms which can cause intense itching and burning. The vesicular stage is usually followed by a dry, desquamating phase in which the skin can peel, crack or crust.<br /><br />Treatment usually involves liberal use of emollients, avoidance of irritants and potent or very potent topical corticosteroids.<br /><br />Keratoderma blennorhagicum presents as vesico-pustular waxy yellow-brown lesions on the palms and soles. It is associated with reactive arthritis.<br /><br />Palmoplantar pustulosis is a chronic condition associated with fluid-filled blisters on the palms and sole of the feet. Distinguishing this from pompholyx eczema clinically can be difficult. However, about 25% of patients with palmoplantar pustulosis have psoriasis on other body parts, and there is a very strong association with smoking. The correlation with high temperatures and humidity is also not as strong compared with pompholyx eczema.<br /><br />Scabies - caused by infestation by the parasite <i>Sarcoptes scabiei</i> - manifests as intense itching of the hands and web spaces but is not usually a recurring condition. Clinical features include linear burrows and erythematous papules, rather than vesicles.<br /><br />Tinea manuum describes a dermatophyte infection of one or both hands. It usually appears as a slowly extending area of dry, peeling and scaly erythematous skin and typically only affects one hand. It is more common in those who do manual work who sweat profusely in their hands.",

            "The correct answer is to <b>start antiretroviral therapy now</b>. According to the current UK guidelines, antiretroviral therapy (ART) should be initiated in all individuals with HIV-1 infection, regardless of CD4 count. This approach is known as 'treat-all' or 'test and treat', and it has been shown to reduce morbidity, mortality, and HIV transmission rates. The initiation of ART in this patient would help to suppress her viral load, preserve her immune function, and prevent the development of opportunistic infections.<br /><br />The option <b>wait until the CD4 count is below 200 * 10<sup>6</sup>/l</b> is incorrect because waiting for such a low CD4 count before starting ART increases the risk of opportunistic infections and other complications associated with advanced immunosuppression. Furthermore, it contradicts current guidelines recommending ART initiation regardless of CD4 count.<br /><br />The option <b>wait until the CD4 count is above 350 * 10<sup>6</sup>/l</b> is also incorrect. Waiting for a higher CD4 count before initiating ART does not provide any additional benefits compared to starting treatment immediately.

            "The correct answer is <b>Quiet breath sounds on auscultation</b>. In life-threatening asthma, quiet or silent chest on auscultation is a particularly concerning sign as it indicates severe bronchospasm with minimal air movement. This occurs because the airways are so constricted that there is insufficient air flow to generate the typical wheeze heard in less severe asthma. This is one of the key signs that clinicians must recognise as indicating imminent respiratory failure requiring immediate intensive intervention.<br /><br /><b>SpO2 of 94%</b> is not indicative of life-threatening asthma. While any hypoxaemia is concerning in asthma, oxygen saturations would typically be much lower (less than 92%) in a life-threatening attack. A saturation of 94% suggests moderate rather than severe disease.<br /><br /><b>Heart rate of 120 bpm</b> represents only a moderate tachycardia in a 9-year-old child. In life-threatening asthma, the heart rate would typically be significantly higher, often greater than 140 beats per minute, as the child becomes increasingly distressed and requires increased cardiac output to maintain oxygen delivery.<br /><br /><b>Respiratory rate of 30 per minute</b> is elevated but not to the degree expected in life-threatening asthma. In severe attacks, the respiratory rate would typically be much higher, often greater than 40 breaths per minute in a child of this age, reflecting increased work of breathing and respiratory distress.<br /><br /><b>Peak flow 40% of predicted</b>, while indicating significant airway obstruction, is not necessarily indicative of life-threatening asthma. In life-threatening attacks, the peak flow would typically be less than 33% of predicted, or the child may be unable to perform the measurement at all due to severe respiratory distress. Additionally, in life-threatening asthma, there may be a poor response to bronchodilators with minimal improvement in peak flow readings.",

            "The correct answer is <b><i>Treponema pallidum</i></b>. This organism causes syphilis, a sexually transmitted infection that often presents in stages. The first stage typically involves a painless genital ulcer (chancre), as reported by the patient two months ago. The second stage, which can occur weeks to months after the initial infection, is characterised by a widespread maculopapular rash and mucosal lesions such as mouth ulcers. This matches the current presentation of our patient.<br /><br /><b>Lymphogranuloma venereum</b> is an incorrect option. Caused by certain strains of <i>Chlamydia trachomatis</i>, it usually presents with painful genital ulcers and swollen inguinal lymph nodes, known as buboes. These are not features reported by this patient.<br /><br /><b>Herpes simplex virus type 2</b> is also incorrect. While it can cause painful penile ulcers, it does not typically lead to a widespread rash or mouth ulcers. Furthermore, herpes lesions are recurrent and usually present as grouped vesicles on an erythematous base rather than a single painless ulcer.<br /><br />The third incorrect option is <b><i>Mycoplasma genitalium</i></b>. This bacterium can cause non-gonococcal urethritis in men, presenting with dysuria and urethral discharge but not with penile ulcers or a maculopapular rash.<br /><br />Lastly, <b><i>Treponema pertenue</i></b> is also an incorrect choice. It causes yaws, a tropical infection that primarily affects skin and bones. Although it may cause skin lesions and oral ulcers like syphilis, yaws does not involve genital ulceration and its distribution pattern differs from syphilis; furthermore, yaws is rare outside specific endemic areas in Africa, Southeast Asia and Latin America.",
