        "body": "Acute coronary syndrome (ACS) is a very common and important presentation in medicine. The management of ACS has evolved over recent years, with the development of new drugs and procedures such as percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI).<br /><br />Emergency departments often have their own protocols based on local factors such as the availability of PCI and hospital drug formularies. The following is based on the 2020 update to the NICE ACS guidelines.<br /><br />Acute coronary syndrome can be classified as follows:<br /><ul><li>ST-elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI): ST-segment elevation + elevated biomarkers of myocardial damage</li><li>non ST-elevation myocardial infarction (NSTEMI): ECG changes but no ST-segment elevation + elevated biomarkers of myocardial damage</li><li>unstable angina</li></ul><br />The management of ACS depends on the particular subtype.

            "<b>Total hip replacement</b> is the most appropriate management for this patient. NICE guideline NG124 on hip fractures recommends offering a total hip replacement (THR) over a hemiarthroplasty for patients with a displaced intracapsular fracture who meet specific criteria. These criteria include being able to walk independently outdoors with no more than the use of a stick, not being cognitively impaired, and being medically fit for anaesthesia and the procedure. This patient meets all these criteria: she is cognitively intact, medically fit, and mobilises independently outdoors with a stick. Although she is 80 years old, physiological fitness and pre-morbid mobility are more important determinants than chronological age. THR provides better long-term functional outcomes, less pain, and a lower re-operation rate compared to hemiarthroplasty in this selected group of patients.

            "<b>Dobutamine infusion</b> is the correct answer for this patient presenting with acute heart failure and cardiogenic shock. The clinical picture shows clear evidence of acute decompensated heart failure (breathlessness, bibasal crackles, gallop rhythm) in a patient with known severe left ventricular dysfunction (ischaemic cardiomyopathy), but crucially he is hypotensive with a systolic blood pressure of 82 mmHg. This represents cardiogenic shock, which is a challenging scenario as many standard acute heart failure treatments may worsen hypotension. Dobutamine is an inotropic agent that increases myocardial contractility and cardiac output whilst having vasodilatory properties. It is specifically recommended for patients with severe left ventricular dysfunction who have potentially reversible cardiogenic shock. The goal is to improve cardiac output and end-organ perfusion whilst addressing the pulmonary congestion. In this hypotensive state, dobutamine should be initiated before or alongside cautious diuretic therapy.<br /><br /><b>Furosemide infusion</b> is the standard treatment for acute heart failure with pulmonary oedema, and would typically be first-line in most presentations. However, in this patient with significant hypotension (systolic BP 82 mmHg), aggressive diuresis could further reduce preload and worsen cardiac output, potentially leading to end-organ hypoperfusion. Whilst diuretics will likely be needed to manage fluid overload, they should be used cautiously after addressing the cardiogenic shock with inotropic support. Loop diuretics reduce preload through venous dilatation and subsequent diuresis, but in the context of cardiogenic shock, improving contractility takes priority.<br /><br /><b>Glyceryl trinitrate infusion</b> is a vasodilator that reduces both preload and afterload, and can be useful in acute heart failure, particularly when there is concomitant myocardial ischaemia or severe hypertension. However, nitrates are contraindicated in hypotensive patients and should generally only be considered when systolic blood pressure exceeds 100 mmHg. In this patient with a systolic pressure of 82 mmHg, GTN would likely cause further haemodynamic compromise and worsen end-organ perfusion. The vasodilatory effects would be detrimental in the setting of cardiogenic shock.<br /><br /><b>Norepinephrine infusion</b> is a vasopressor agent that increases systemic vascular resistance and blood pressure. Whilst it has a role in cardiogenic shock, it is typically reserved for situations where there is an insufficient response to inotropic agents and evidence of end-organ hypoperfusion despite inotropic support. As a first-line agent, norepinephrine would increase afterload, which could further impair cardiac output in a failing heart. The preferred approach is to first attempt to improve cardiac contractility with an inotrope like dobutamine, reserving vasopressors for refractory cases.<br /><br /><b>Sodium nitroprusside infusion</b> is another vasodilator with both arterial and venous dilating properties, reducing preload and afterload. Like GTN, it may have a role in acute heart failure complicated by severe hypertension or significant valvular regurgitation. However, it is absolutely contraindicated in this hypotensive patient. The profound vasodilatory effects would exacerbate the existing hypotension and could precipitate cardiovascular collapse. This patient requires augmentation of cardiac output rather than reduction in systemic vascular resistance.",

        "title": "Aspirin",
        "body": "Aspirin works by blocking the action of both <span class=\"concept\" data-cid=\"8980\">cyclooxygenase-1 and 2</span>. Cyclooxygenase is responsible for prostaglandin, prostacyclin and thromboxane synthesis. The blocking of <span class=\"concept\" data-cid=\"11008\">thromboxane A2</span> formation in platelets reduces the ability of platelets to aggregate which has lead to the widespread use of low-dose aspirin in cardiovascular disease. Until recent guidelines changed all patients with established cardiovascular disease took aspirin if there was no contraindication. Following the 2010 technology appraisal of clopidogrel this is no longer the case*.<br /><br />Two recent trials (the Aspirin for Asymptomatic Atherosclerosis and the Antithrombotic Trialists Collaboration) have cast doubt on the use of aspirin in primary prevention of cardiovascular disease. Guidelines have not yet changed to reflect this. However the Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA) issued a drug safety update in January 2010 reminding prescribers that aspirin is not licensed for primary prevention.<br /><br />What do the <i>current</i> guidelines recommend?<br /><ul><li>first-line for patients with ischaemic heart disease</li></ul><br />Potentiates<br /><ul><li>oral hypoglycaemics</li><li>warfarin</li><li>steroids</li></ul><br />Aspirin should not be used in children under 16 due to the risk of <span class=\"concept\" data-cid=\"2131\">Reye's syndrome</span>. An exception is Kawasaki disease, where the benefits are thought to outweigh the risks.<br /><br /><br />*NICE now recommend clopidogrel first-line following an ischaemic stroke and for peripheral arterial disease. For TIAs the situation is more complex. Recent Royal College of Physician (RCP) guidelines support the use of clopidogrel in TIAs. However the older NICE guidelines still recommend aspirin + dipyridamole - a position the RCP state is 'illogical'",
