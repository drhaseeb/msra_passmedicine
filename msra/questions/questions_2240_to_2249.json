            "<b>Glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase deficiency</b> is the correct answer. This X-linked recessive condition typically presents in boys with episodic haemolysis triggered by oxidative stress from infections or certain medications. The history of neonatal jaundice requiring phototherapy is characteristic, as G6PD deficiency is a common cause of severe neonatal hyperbilirubinaemia. The blood film findings of irregular cell margins (bite and blister cells) and inclusion bodies (Heinz bodies) are pathognomonic for G6PD deficiency. Heinz bodies represent denatured haemoglobin that has precipitated due to oxidative damage when red cells lack adequate reduced glutathione protection. The recent chest infection and its treatment (likely with antibiotics such as ciprofloxacin or sulphonamides) would have precipitated this acute haemolytic crisis. Splenomegaly can occur in G6PD deficiency, though it is typically mild. The diagnosis should be confirmed with G6PD enzyme assay, ideally performed 3 months after the acute episode to avoid false-negative results, as the most severely affected cells will have already haemolysed.<br /><br /><b>Hereditary spherocytosis</b> is an autosomal dominant condition affecting both sexes equally, more common in Northern Europeans. Whilst it also presents with neonatal jaundice and splenomegaly, the blood film would show spherocytes (round cells lacking central pallor) rather than Heinz bodies. The haemolysis in hereditary spherocytosis is typically chronic with acute exacerbations during infections, but the blood film findings in this case are not consistent with spherocytosis. The diagnosis is confirmed by EMA binding test rather than enzyme assay.<br /><br /><b>Autoimmune haemolytic anaemia</b> can present with acute haemolysis and jaundice, but would be unusual in a 4-year-old without other autoimmune features or underlying conditions. The blood film would typically show spherocytes and agglutination rather than Heinz bodies. A positive direct antiglobulin test (Coombs test) would be expected. The history of neonatal jaundice would be atypical for this diagnosis, as autoimmune haemolytic anaemia rarely presents in the neonatal period.<br /><br /><b>Sickle cell disease</b> typically presents with painful vaso-occlusive crises rather than isolated jaundice and pallor. Whilst infections can trigger crises and neonatal screening would have identified this condition in the UK, the blood film would show sickle cells, target cells, and Howell-Jolly bodies rather than Heinz bodies. The clinical picture described lacks the typical pain associated with sickle cell crises, and the specific blood film findings point away from this diagnosis.<br /><br /><b>Pyruvate kinase deficiency</b> is another red cell enzyme defect causing hereditary non-spherocytic haemolytic anaemia. It is autosomal recessive and can present with neonatal jaundice and chronic haemolysis. However, the haemolysis is typically chronic rather than episodic, and whilst infections can worsen anaemia, the dramatic acute presentation following infection is less characteristic. The blood film would show echinocytes and polychromasia but not Heinz bodies, which are specific to oxidative damage seen in G6PD deficiency.",

            "The correct answer is <b>oligohydramnios</b>. Developmental dysplasia of the hip (DDH) refers to a spectrum of disorders that range from subtle acetabular dysplasia to complete dislocation of the hip. Oligohydramnios, which is a condition characterised by low amniotic fluid in pregnancy, can lead to DDH as it restricts foetal movement and thus normal development of the hip joint.<br /><br /><b>Vertex presentation</b> is not associated with an increased risk for DDH. It is the most common fetal presentation and is considered normal. In contrast, breech presentation has been identified as a risk factor for DDH due to mechanical forces that may affect the development of the hip joint.<br /><br /><b>Male sex</b> does not increase the risk of DDH. In fact, female infants are more likely to develop this condition due to increased ligamentous laxity from maternal hormones.<br /><br /><b>Maternal diabetes mellitus</b> is also not linked with an increased risk for DDH. While gestational diabetes can lead to macrosomia (large body size at birth), which in turn can cause birth injuries such as shoulder dystocia or fractures, there's no established association between maternal diabetes and developmental dysplasia of the hip.<br /><br />Lastly, <b>Polyhydramnios</b>, or excessive amniotic fluid, also doesn't contribute towards a higher risk for DDH.

The clinical presentation is typical: a preschool-aged child with characteristic pearly, umbilicated papules in clusters on the trunk and arms. According to UK guidelines, treatment is not usually recommended for molluscum contagiosum in children as it is a self-limiting viral infection that typically resolves spontaneously within 18 months. Management should focus on reassuring parents about the benign nature of the condition, explaining that lesions are contagious (advising against sharing towels and baths with siblings), and encouraging the child not to scratch the lesions. Exclusion from school or swimming is not necessary. The child's mild eczema background is noted but does not change management unless there is active inflammation around the molluscum lesions, which is not described in this scenario. This conservative approach avoids unnecessary interventions that may cause discomfort, scarring, or psychological distress to the child.<br /><br /><b>Topical fusidic acid</b> would be appropriate if there were signs of secondary bacterial infection around the molluscum lesions, such as oedema, crusting, or purulent discharge. However, the scenario describes uncomplicated pearly papules without features suggesting infection. Antibiotics are not indicated for the viral infection itself and should only be used when there is clear evidence of bacterial superinfection.<br /><br /><b>Cryotherapy</b> may be considered if lesions are troublesome or considered unsightly by the family, but it is not first-line management. It is typically reserved for older children or adults who can tolerate the procedure, and should only be performed by healthcare professionals experienced in the technique. In a 3-year-old with uncomplicated lesions present for only 4 weeks, cryotherapy would be premature and potentially distressing.<br /><br /><b>Topical hydrocortisone</b> would be indicated if there were eczema or inflammation developing around the molluscum lesions causing problematic itching. While the child has a background of mild eczema, there is no mention of active eczematous changes or inflammation around the molluscum lesions in this scenario. Treatment with a mild topical corticosteroid should be reserved for symptomatic cases.<br /><br /><b>Referral to dermatology</b> is not routinely indicated for uncomplicated molluscum contagiosum in immunocompetent children. Referral would be appropriate for HIV-positive patients with extensive lesions, those with eyelid-margin or ocular lesions with associated red eye, or adults with anogenital lesions requiring screening for sexually transmitted infections.

Referral would be appropriate for HIV-positive patients with extensive lesions, those with eyelid-margin or ocular lesions with associated red eye, or adults with anogenital lesions requiring screening for sexually transmitted infections. This child has straightforward molluscum that can be managed in primary care.",

        "body": "Molluscum contagiosum is a common skin infection caused by molluscum contagiosum virus (MCV), a member of the <span class=\"concept\" data-cid=\"11963\">Poxviridae family</span>. Transmission occurs directly by close personal contact, or indirectly via fomites (contaminated surfaces) such as shared towels and flannels. The majority of cases occur in children (often in children with atopic eczema), with the maximum incidence in preschool children aged 1-4 years.<br /><br />Typically, molluscum contagiosum presents with characteristic pinkish or pearly white papules with a central umbilication, which are up to 5 mm in diameter. Lesions appear in clusters in areas anywhere on the body (except the palms of the hands and the soles of the feet). In children, lesions are commonly seen on the trunk and in flexures, but anogenital lesions may also occur. In adults, sexual contact may lead to lesions developing on the genitalia, pubis, thighs, and lower abdomen. Rarely, lesions can occur on the oral mucosa and on the eyelids.<br /><br /><div class=\"container\"><div class=\"row\"><div class=\"col-md-3\"><a href=\"https://d32xxyeh8kfs8k.cloudfront.net/images_Passmedicine/dsd121b.jpg\" data-fancybox=\"gallery\" data-caption=\"Molluscum contagiosum .

This condition is a demyelinating disease of the central nervous system that often presents with optic neuritis, which can cause eye pain and a relative afferent pupillary defect (RAPD). RAPD is an abnormal finding on the swinging flashlight test where the pupils dilate when light swings from the unaffected to the affected eye. It's indicative of an optic nerve lesion, such as in optic neuritis - a common early symptom of multiple sclerosis.<br /><br /><b>Motor neuron disease</b> is incorrect because it primarily affects motor neurons in the brain and spinal cord, leading to progressive muscle weakness and wasting. Symptoms typically include difficulty with speech, swallowing and breathing, but it doesn't usually cause eye pain or RAPD.<br /><br /><b>Myasthenia gravis</b>, although it can affect any voluntary muscles including those controlling eye movements, typically causes diplopia (double vision) and ptosis (drooping eyelid), rather than eye pain or RAPD.

However, in this scenario, as mentioned earlier, there has been no sexual activity since her last period. Thus, waiting for 2 days before relying on it as a contraceptive method is unnecessary.<br /><br /><b>5 days</b>: This option could apply to emergency contraception using an IUD (copper-bearing) when it's inserted up to 5 days after unprotected intercourse or within 5 days from expected ovulation date to prevent pregnancy.
