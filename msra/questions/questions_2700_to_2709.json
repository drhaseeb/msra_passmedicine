            "<b>Topical glyceryl trinitrate (GTN)</b> is the correct answer. This patient has a chronic anal fissure, defined as being present for more than 6 weeks. The history of severe pain on defecation with bright red bleeding and a posterior midline tear on examination is classical. Initial conservative management, including dietary advice and laxatives to ensure soft stools, has already been attempted and failed. According to UK guidelines (NICE CKS), the first-line pharmacological treatment for a chronic anal fissure is a course of topical glyceryl trinitrate. GTN is a nitric oxide donor which causes relaxation of the internal anal sphincter, reducing sphincter pressure and improving blood supply to the anoderm, which in turn promotes healing. It is typically prescribed for a course of 6-8 weeks. A common side effect is headache, which can limit its use in some patients.<br /><br /><b>Topical diltiazem</b> is an incorrect choice at this stage. Topical diltiazem, a calcium channel blocker, also works by relaxing the internal anal sphincter and is an effective treatment for chronic anal fissures. However, it is considered a second-line medical treatment in the UK. It is typically reserved for patients in whom topical GTN is ineffective after an 8-week course, or for those who cannot tolerate GTN due to side effects such as severe headaches. As GTN has not yet been trialled, it would be inappropriate to start with diltiazem.<br /><br /><b>Topical hydrocortisone</b> is incorrect. While topical steroids are commonly used in proctology, their primary indication is for inflammatory conditions such as haemorrhoids or proctitis to reduce inflammation and itching. They have no role in the management of anal fissures. In fact, their use could theoretically be detrimental by impairing wound healing. This option is a plausible distractor as it is a common rectal preparation, but it is not the appropriate treatment for this specific pathology.<br /><br /><b>Botulinum toxin injection</b> is an incorrect choice. Injection of botulinum toxin into the internal anal sphincter is a specialist treatment for chronic anal fissures. It causes a temporary chemical sphincterotomy by paralysing the muscle, thereby aiding healing. It is generally considered a third-line option in secondary care, used for patients who have failed to respond to both topical GTN and diltiazem, or as an alternative to surgery. It is not a first-line treatment to be initiated in primary care.<br /><br /><b>Lateral internal sphincterotomy</b> is incorrect. This is the gold-standard surgical treatment for chronic anal fissures and has the highest healing rates. However, surgery is reserved for cases that are refractory to medical management. It carries a small but significant risk of permanent faecal incontinence, and therefore non-invasive treatments must be exhausted first. A referral for surgical consideration would only be appropriate after an adequate trial of first and second-line medical therapies (e.g., an 8-week course of topical GTN) has failed.",

It is also an opportunity to discuss immunisations and maternal mental health.<br /><br /><b>Newborn clinical examination</b> is a mandatory check that should be completed within 72 hours of birth. This examination includes checking for congenital abnormalities, cardiac conditions, developmental dysplasia of the hip, and eye problems including congenital cataracts.<br /><br />The <b>heel-prick test at 5-9 days</b> (newborn blood spot screening) is a fundamental component of the programme.

This regimen includes aciclovir, an antiviral agent used primarily for treating viral encephalitis caused by herpes simplex virus. In the absence of encephalitic symptoms and given a strong clinical presumption of bacterial aetiology, incorporating aciclovir into the treatment plan is unwarranted. This case is unlikely to be viral aetiology because the lumbar puncture shows a turbid appearance, elevated protein (0.9 g/dL), and a high white blood cell count (1230 cells/\u00b5L) with neutrophil predominance, which are more characteristic of bacterial meningitis. In viral cases, the cerebrospinal fluid typically shows a clear appearance, normal or mildly elevated protein, and lymphocytic predominance.<br /><br /><b>Give IV ciprofloxacin</b> should not be considered first-line therapy for bacterial meningitis. Ciprofloxacin lacks comprehensive activity against all primary causative agents of meningitis and fails to achieve satisfactory cerebrospinal fluid levels compared to third-generation cephalosporins such as ceftriaxone.",

            "The correct answer is <b>Resting tremor + bradykinesia + rigidity</b>. These are the three cardinal signs of Parkinson's disease. A resting tremor is a rhythmic, involuntary movement that occurs when muscles are relaxed, and it is often one of the first symptoms of Parkinson's disease. Bradykinesia refers to slowness of movement and difficulty initiating movements, while rigidity refers to stiffness or inflexibility of the limbs or body. <br /><br />The option <b>Resting tremor + bradykinesia + fasciculation</b> is incorrect because fasciculations (small, local, involuntary muscle contractions) are not a typical feature of Parkinson's disease. They are more commonly associated with diseases affecting lower motor neurons such as Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis (ALS).<br /><br /><b>Intention tremor + chorea + lead-pipe rigidity</b> is also incorrect. Intention tremors occur during targeted movements and are not seen in Parkinson's disease but rather in conditions affecting the cerebellum such as Multiple Sclerosis. Chorea, rapid, dance-like movements, is also not a feature of Parkinson's but rather conditions like Huntington's disease.<br /><br />The option <b>Resting tremor + chorea + cogwheel rigidity</b> includes two features seen in Parkinson's - resting tremor and cogwheel rigidity (an increased tone that has a 'ratchety' feel due to superimposed tremor). However, chorea is not typically seen in this condition.<br /><br />Finally, <b>Intention tremor + bradykinesia + rigidity</b> contains two correct features - bradykinesia and rigidity - but intention tremors do not typically occur in Parkinson's disease.<br />",

The UK National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) guidelines recommend considering referral for genetic testing if there are close relatives diagnosed with breast cancer before the age of 40. <br /><br /><b>An aunt with endometrial cancer</b> is not a direct risk factor for breast cancer. While some genetic conditions, like Lynch syndrome, can increase the risk of both endometrial and certain types of breast cancer, this link is not strong enough to prompt referral based on this history alone without other supporting family history.<br /><br /><b>Her sister's cancer being ER (oestrogen receptor) positive</b> does indicate that her sister's tumour was sensitive to oestrogen and thus could be treated with hormone therapy. However, it doesn't necessarily correlate with increased familial risk or the need for genetic testing in family members.<br /><br />Similarly, <b>Her sister's cancer being HER2 (oestrogen receptor) positive</b> means that her sister's tumour overexpresses the HER2 protein and could be treated with targeted therapies like trastuzumab. But again, this biomarker does not directly imply an increased genetic risk in relatives.<br /><br />Lastly, <b>Her sister having metastases at the time of diagnosis</b>, while indicating advanced disease in her sister, does not inherently suggest a higher familial or genetic risk necessitating referral to a specialist for the patient herself.<br />",
