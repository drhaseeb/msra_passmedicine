        "question_notes": "This question involves a lady presenting with fast atrial fibrillation. Atrial fibrillation can be treated with rate control of rhythm control. In this case, as the patient is younger, the cardiologist would like to attempt rhythm control with pharmacological cardioversion. There are a few options for this cardioversion and flecainide is one of them. <br /><br />However, flecainide cannot be used in people if there is any known ischaemic or structural heart disease and therefore an echocardiogram is required to rule this out before the drug can be given.",

        "body": "Flecainide is a Vaughan Williams class 1c antiarrhythmic. It slows conduction of the action potential by acting as a potent <span class=\"concept\" data-cid=\"9381\">sodium channel blocker (specifically the Nav1.5 sodium channels)</span>. This may be reflected by widening of the QRS complex and prolongation of the PR interval.<br /><br />The Cardiac Arrhythmia Suppression Trial (CAST, 1989) investigated the use of agents to treat asymptomatic or mildly symptomatic premature ventricular complexes (PVCs) post myocardial infarction. The hypothesis was that this would reduce deaths from ventricular arrhythmias.

            "The correct answer is <b>'Initially irregular bleeding later followed by light menses or amenorrhoea'</b>. This is because the Mirena intrauterine system (IUS) releases a small amount of the hormone levonorgestrel into the uterus. This hormone has multiple effects, one of which is to thin the lining of the uterus which reduces menstrual flow and can lead to amenorrhoea in some women. Initially, this may cause irregular spotting or light bleeding but over time (usually within 3-6 months), periods tend to become lighter and less painful, and some women stop having periods altogether.<br /><br />The option <b>'Continual, light bleeding is seen in 70%'</b> is incorrect. While it's true that Mirena can initially cause irregular spotting or light bleeding, it doesn't usually result in continual bleeding. Most women experience a reduction in menstrual flow over time.<br /><br />The statement <b>'Initially irregular bleeding later followed by periods that are generally heavier and longer'</b> is also not accurate. The Mirena IUS typically causes periods to become lighter and shorter over time due to its effect on the endometrium.<br /><br /><b>'Heavy period approximately every 3 months'</b> is another incorrect option. The Mirena IUS does not typically cause heavy periods at any point during its use, let alone every three months.<br /><br />Finally, the statement <b>'Amenorrhoea in > 90% after 2 months'</b> is not accurate either. Although amenorrhoea can occur with Mirena use, it isn't as common as this statement suggests and certainly doesn't usually happen as quickly as two months post-insertion. According to NICE guidelines, about 20% of users will have amenorrhoea after a year of use.<br />",

            "The symptoms described are in keeping with necrotizing fasciitis, and the site that is most commonly affected is the perineum, as stated in the patient's presenting complaint. Based on his observations he is pyrexial and tachycardia/tachypnoea which may be due to the severe pain he is experiencing. The patient is a type 2 diabetic which increases his risk of developing necrotizing fasciitis and he is also taking dapagliflozin, which is an SGLT-2 inhibitor, associated with a further increase in risk. <br /><br />In the early stages, there is lots of overlap between cellulitis and necrotizing fasciitis with it being difficult to distinguish between the two. The presence of bullae in the rash, the purple discolouration, and the severe pain, all in a patient with risk factors for necrotizing fasciitis would make cellulitis a less likely diagnosis. <br /><br />Septic arthritis is a medical emergency like necrotizing fasciitis but it arises in a joint space, which is not the case in this patient. The affected joint would be red, hot and swollen and there would be a reduction in range of movement. <br /><br />Pyoderma gangrenosum presents as a rapidly enlarging, very painful ulcer and is commonly associated with inflammatory conditions like inflammatory bowel disease and rheumatoid arthritis. The rash described in this scenario is not ulcerated and the patient doesn't have any past medical history of inflammatory bowel disease or rheumatoid arthritis. <br /><br />Hidradenitis suppurativa is a chronic inflammatory skin disease that can lead to inflammatory lesions, pustules, and abscesses forming in the groin area. These lesions are painful but don't tend to arise acutely and don't match the description of the rash from this case.",

        "question_notes": "The symptoms described are in keeping with necrotizing fasciitis, and the site that is most commonly affected is the perineum, as stated in the patient's presenting complaint. Based on his observations he is pyrexial and tachycardia/tachypnoea which may be due to the severe pain he is experiencing. The patient is a type 2 diabetic which increases his risk of developing necrotizing fasciitis and he is also taking dapagliflozin, which is an SGLT-2 inhibitor, associated with a further increase in risk. <br /><br />In the early stages, there is lots of overlap between cellulitis and necrotizing fasciitis with it being difficult to distinguish between the two. The presence of bullae in the rash, the purple discolouration, and the severe pain, all in a patient with risk factors for necrotizing fasciitis would make cellulitis a less likely diagnosis. <br /><br />Septic arthritis is a medical emergency like necrotizing fasciitis but it arises in a joint space, which is not the case in this patient. The affected joint would be red, hot and swollen and there would be a reduction in range of movement. <br /><br />Pyoderma gangrenosum presents as a rapidly enlarging, very painful ulcer and is commonly associated with inflammatory conditions like inflammatory bowel disease and rheumatoid arthritis. The rash described in this scenario is not ulcerated and the patient doesn't have any past medical history of inflammatory bowel disease or rheumatoid arthritis. <br /><br />Hidradenitis suppurativa is a chronic inflammatory skin disease that can lead to inflammatory lesions, pustules, and abscesses forming in the groin area. These lesions are painful but don't tend to arise acutely and don't match the description of the rash from this case.",

            "This patient displays typical features of GAD including feeling anxious most of the time, feeling restless, and feeling irritable. Once physical causes of anxiety - such as thyroid disease and medication-induced - have been ruled out, GAD is treated in a stepwise approach.

Unfortunately, the patient has completed both of these steps with no improvement. She requires step 3 of treatment. Step 3 is either a high-intensity psychological intervention (such as cognitive behavioural therapy) or drug treatment, depending on the patient's choice. This patient has made it clear that she would prefer drug treatment. The first line-drug treatment for GAD is a selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI).

If a patient with GAD cannot tolerate sertraline or it is not effective, NICE recommend offering an alternative SSRI or an SNRI (serotonin-norepinephrine reuptake inhibitor). In this case, citalopram would be an appropriate choice. <br /><br /><b>Diazepam</b> is a benzodiazepine. NICE recommend that benzodiazepines should not be given for GAD. This is due to the risk of dependence. The only exception is that they may be given short-term in a crisis.
