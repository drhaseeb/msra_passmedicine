            "The correct answer is <b>Latanoprost</b>. This patient's raised intraocular pressure and decreased peripheral vision suggest that he has glaucoma, likely primary open-angle glaucoma (POAG) given his age. Latanoprost is a prostaglandin analogue which works by increasing the outflow of aqueous humour from the eye, thereby reducing intraocular pressure. It is recommended as first-line treatment for POAG in the NICE guidelines.<br /><br /><b>Pilocarpine</b> is a miotic agent which was once commonly used in the management of glaucoma but has largely been superseded by more effective and better-tolerated drugs like latanoprost. Its use is now mostly restricted to acute angle-closure glaucoma where it can help to open up the drainage angle and reduce intraocular pressure.<br /><br /><b>Timolol</b> is a non-selective beta-blocker which reduces the production of aqueous humour, thus lowering intraocular pressure. However, it would not be suitable for this patient due to his history of asthma - beta-blockers can potentially trigger bronchospasm in susceptible individuals.<br /><br /><b>Dorzolamide</b> is a carbonic anhydrase inhibitor which also decreases aqueous humour production. It may be used as adjunctive therapy in patients with POAG who are not adequately controlled on monotherapy, but it would not typically be chosen as first-line treatment due to its need for multiple daily dosing and potential for local ocular side effects.<br /><br />Finally, <b>Brimonidine</b> is an alpha-2 adrenergic agonist that both decreases production of aqueous humour and increases uveoscleral outflow. Like dorzolamide, it may be used as adjunctive therapy but would not usually be first-line due to its potential systemic side effects including dry mouth and fatigue.<br />",

        "body": "Glaucomas are optic neuropathies associated with raised intraocular pressure (IOP). They can be classified based on whether the peripheral iris is covering the trabecular meshwork, which is important in the drainage of aqueous humour from the anterior chamber of the eye. In open-angle glaucoma, the iris is clear of the meshwork.

            "<b>Complete smoking abstinence</b> is the most important preventative advice for this patient with asbestosis. While he has already stopped smoking, reinforcing complete and permanent abstinence is crucial because asbestos exposure and cigarette smoking have a synergistic effect on lung cancer risk. Patients with asbestos exposure who smoke have a dramatically elevated risk of developing bronchogenic carcinoma compared to either risk factor alone - the risk is multiplicative rather than additive. Bronchogenic carcinoma is actually the most common malignancy associated with asbestos exposure, being more frequent than mesothelioma. Given this patient's significant smoking history (30 pack-years) and confirmed asbestos exposure (evidenced by pleural plaques and asbestosis), ensuring he maintains complete smoking cessation is the single most impactful intervention to reduce his cancer risk. Even though he stopped 5 years ago, the ongoing risk remains elevated, and any relapse to smoking would substantially increase his already elevated cancer risk. This advice directly addresses the most significant modifiable risk factor for the most common asbestos-related malignancy.<br /><br /><b>Annual CT surveillance for mesothelioma</b> is not recommended in UK practice. There is no established screening programme for mesothelioma in asbestos-exposed individuals, as early detection has not been shown to improve outcomes. Mesothelioma, while strongly associated with asbestos, is actually less common than bronchogenic carcinoma in this population. The disease typically presents with symptoms, and surveillance imaging does not form part of standard management guidelines.<br /><br /><b>Pneumococcal and influenza vaccination</b> is good general advice for patients with chronic lung disease and would be appropriate for this patient with asbestosis. However, while these vaccinations reduce the risk of respiratory infections and their complications, they do not address the most significant risk this patient faces - the development of lung cancer. Given the synergistic relationship between asbestos and smoking in causing bronchogenic carcinoma, smoking cessation advice is more important than vaccination in terms of preventative impact.<br /><br /><b>Avoid further asbestos exposure</b> is sensible advice, but this patient is a former shipyard worker who has presumably already ceased occupational exposure. The damage from asbestos is cumulative and the latent period for disease development is typically 15-30 years for asbestosis. While avoiding any additional exposure is reasonable, the patient already has established asbestosis with pleural plaques, indicating significant historical exposure. The most important modifiable risk factor at this stage is smoking cessation rather than avoiding further exposure that is unlikely to occur.<br /><br /><b>Annual sputum cytology screening</b> is not recommended for lung cancer screening in any population, including those with asbestos exposure. Studies have shown that sputum cytology is not an effective screening tool for lung cancer as it lacks sufficient sensitivity and specificity. Current evidence supports low-dose CT screening in high-risk populations (such as heavy smokers aged 55-74), but sputum cytology has no role in modern screening protocols. The most important intervention remains ensuring complete smoking abstinence given the synergistic cancer risk.",

Patients with asbestos exposure who smoke have a dramatically elevated risk of developing bronchogenic carcinoma compared to either risk factor alone - the risk is multiplicative rather than additive. Bronchogenic carcinoma is actually the most common malignancy associated with asbestos exposure, being more frequent than mesothelioma. Given this patient's significant smoking history (30 pack-years) and confirmed asbestos exposure (evidenced by pleural plaques and asbestosis), ensuring he maintains complete smoking cessation is the single most impactful intervention to reduce his cancer risk. Even though he stopped 5 years ago, the ongoing risk remains elevated, and any relapse to smoking would substantially increase his already elevated cancer risk. This advice directly addresses the most significant modifiable risk factor for the most common asbestos-related malignancy.<br /><br /><b>Annual CT surveillance for mesothelioma</b> is not recommended in UK practice. There is no established screening programme for mesothelioma in asbestos-exposed individuals, as early detection has not been shown to improve outcomes. Mesothelioma, while strongly associated with asbestos, is actually less common than bronchogenic carcinoma in this population. The disease typically presents with symptoms, and surveillance imaging does not form part of standard management guidelines.<br /><br /><b>Pneumococcal and influenza vaccination</b> is good general advice for patients with chronic lung disease and would be appropriate for this patient with asbestosis. However, while these vaccinations reduce the risk of respiratory infections and their complications, they do not address the most significant risk this patient faces - the development of lung cancer. Given the synergistic relationship between asbestos and smoking in causing bronchogenic carcinoma, smoking cessation advice is more important than vaccination in terms of preventative impact.<br /><br /><b>Avoid further asbestos exposure</b> is sensible advice, but this patient is a former shipyard worker who has presumably already ceased occupational exposure. The damage from asbestos is cumulative and the latent period for disease development is typically 15-30 years for asbestosis. While avoiding any additional exposure is reasonable, the patient already has established asbestosis with pleural plaques, indicating significant historical exposure. The most important modifiable risk factor at this stage is smoking cessation rather than avoiding further exposure that is unlikely to occur.<br /><br /><b>Annual sputum cytology screening</b> is not recommended for lung cancer screening in any population, including those with asbestos exposure. Studies have shown that sputum cytology is not an effective screening tool for lung cancer as it lacks sufficient sensitivity and specificity. Current evidence supports low-dose CT screening in high-risk populations (such as heavy smokers aged 55-74), but sputum cytology has no role in modern screening protocols. The most important intervention remains ensuring complete smoking abstinence given the synergistic cancer risk.",

The patient has intestinal metaplasia, which carries an increased risk of progression to oesophageal adenocarcinoma. UK guidelines, such as those from the British Society of Gastroenterology (BSG), recommend high-dose (twice daily) proton pump inhibitor (PPI) therapy. While the evidence for chemoprevention is debated, it is standard practice to maximise acid suppression to control reflux and reduce inflammation.

While controlling GORD with high-dose PPIs is an important part of the treatment, it does not eliminate the risk of malignant transformation. The primary purpose of identifying Barrett's oesophagus is to enter the patient into a surveillance programme to detect dysplasia or early cancer at a treatable stage. Therefore, medical therapy alone is insufficient.<br /><br /><b>Endoscopic radiofrequency ablation</b> is an ablative therapy used to eradicate dysplastic Barrett's epithelium. It is the first-line treatment for both low-grade and high-grade dysplasia. However, in this scenario, the histology has explicitly stated there is no evidence of dysplasia.

The rate at which this occurs (glomerular filtration rate, GFR) depends on the perfusion pressure of the glomerulus.

The efferent arteriole can constrict (to increasing pressure) and this is mediated by angiotensin II. <br /><br />Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs block prostaglandin E2 and thus disrupts this auto-regulation, contributing to AKI. The exception to this is oral aspirin which spares the kidney. Drugs that block angiotensin II such as Angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEI) e.g. Ramipril and angiotensin receptor blockers (ARB) disrupt auto-regulation through the above mechanism and thus should be held during an AKI. <br /><br />In chronic kidney disease (CKD) however, ACEIs and ARBs are beneficial through their antihypertensive and anti-inflammatory actions.
