            "A 37-year-old lady, Mrs Halen is referred to the emergency department by her GP. She reports that when she awoke in the morning her eyes felt like they were moved to one side. Since then, she has felt very dizzy as if the room is spinning and she has been vomiting almost non-stop. She has a dull headache generally around the whole head which came on gradually this morning and is 4/10 severity. She has not experienced photophobia, phonophobia or a rash. She has a history of migraines which present as severe right-sided throbbing head pain but reports that pain to be different from this. <br /><br />She reports being well prior to this episode, other than a mild cold a week ago. She reports a 3 day history of ringing in her right ear and slight muffling of her hearing. She has not noticed any feeling of pressure in the ear. She says that the ear is not painful. Otoscopy examination is normal. <br /><br />Mrs Halen is given promethazine which improves her symptoms of vertigo and vomiting. <br /><br />Which condition is the likely cause of her symptoms?",

        "question_notes": "<b>Promethazine</b> is correct. This patient is experiencing nausea and vomiting during pregnancy. The first-line treatment for nausea and vomiting of pregnancy or hyperemesis gravidarum are antihistamines. Promethazine is a type of antihistamine and so this is the correct answer. <br /><br /><b>Admission to hospital</b> is incorrect. Admission to a hospital is only required in certain situations. For example, in patients who, despite treatment with anti-emetics, are unable to keep fluids down or have lost >5% of their pre-pregnancy weight. These situations do not apply in this scenario and are therefore incorrect. <br /><br /><b>Ondansetron</b> and <b>metoclopramide</b> are incorrect. These are both second-line treatment options for nausea and vomiting of pregnancy. Antihistamines should be trialled first.<br /><br /><b>Paracetamol</b> is incorrect. This is an analgesic drug and so is not a treatment for this patient's symptom of nausea and vomiting.",
