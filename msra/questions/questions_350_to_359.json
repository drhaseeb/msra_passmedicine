            "<b>Aluminium chloride 20% solution</b> is the correct first-line treatment for primary focal hyperhidrosis according to UK guidelines. This topical preparation works by blocking the openings of the sweat glands and causing atrophy of the secretory cells within the eccrine sweat glands. It is particularly effective for axillary hyperhidrosis, which this patient is experiencing. The solution should be applied at night to completely dry skin and washed off in the morning. Initially, it may need to be applied daily, but as symptoms improve, the frequency can be reduced to 1-2 times weekly. The main side effect is skin irritation, which can be minimized by ensuring the skin is completely dry before application and avoiding application after shaving. If skin irritation occurs, 1% hydrocortisone cream can be applied.<br /><br /><b>Botulinum toxin injections</b> are not first-line treatment for hyperhidrosis. While they are effective and licensed for axillary hyperhidrosis, they are typically considered when topical treatments have failed. The treatment involves multiple intradermal injections into the affected area, which blocks the release of acetylcholine from sympathetic nerves that stimulate the eccrine sweat glands. The effects typically last 4-7 months, requiring repeated treatments. This option would be appropriate to consider if the patient fails to respond to aluminium chloride.<br /><br /><b>Glycopyrronium bromide tablets</b> (an anticholinergic medication) are not first-line treatment for focal hyperhidrosis. Oral anticholinergics may be considered for generalized hyperhidrosis or when other treatments for focal hyperhidrosis have failed. They work systemically and therefore have significant side effects including dry mouth, blurred vision, urinary retention, and constipation. This makes them less desirable as a first-line option for focal hyperhidrosis.<br /><br /><b>Iontophoresis</b> involves the passage of a mild electrical current through water (or a medication solution) into the skin. It is particularly useful for palmar and plantar hyperhidrosis, and less commonly used for axillary hyperhidrosis due to practical difficulties in treatment application. It is typically considered a second-line treatment after topical aluminium chloride has failed. The treatment requires specialized equipment and multiple sessions initially, followed by maintenance treatments.<br /><br /><b>Referral for endoscopic thoracic sympathectomy</b> is a surgical option that is only considered when all other treatments have failed and the hyperhidrosis is causing severe impairment to quality of life. This procedure involves cutting or clamping the sympathetic nerves that control sweating. It is highly effective but carries significant risks including compensatory hyperhidrosis (increased sweating in other body areas), which can be worse than the original problem.

Mild hypokalaemia is usually asymptomatic, but at serum potassium levels of less than 2.5mmol/L may cause lethargy, paraesthesia, tetany, muscle weakness and paralysis.<br /><br />We have been told that she is under the cardiologists for her heart failure, and has recently had a 'new medication'. All of the drug options listed are used in the management of heart failure, but furosemide is the only medication that causes hypokalaemia.  The more intuitive candidate would realise that furosemide is not a first line treatment for heart failure and would only be 'added in' for symptomatic relief.<br /><br />Lisinopril is an angiotensin-converting-enzyme inhibitor (ACE-I) which causes hyperkalaemia. All patients with a left ventricular ejection fraction of 40% or less should receive an ACE inhibitor unless contraindicated or not tolerated, as there is a wealth of clinical trial data which demonstrates their effect in reducing mortality and hospital admissions.  They should be prescribed at a low dose and titrated upwards until the target dose or the highest tolerated dose is reached, with renal function and serum electrolytes after each dose increase.<br /><br />Candesartan is an angiotensin-2 receptor antagonist. This class of drug are second line in the treatment of heart failure. Candesartan is licensed for use in heart failure, and can be used in patients intolerant of standard ACE inhibitors. Side effects include dizziness, headache, and hyperkalaemia.<br /><br />Spironolactone is an aldosterone antagonist which should be considered in all patients, especially those who have moderate to severe heart failure (NYHA class 3 or 4) or have had an MI within the past month.  Eplerenone is similar in its actions to spironolactone and was shown in the EMPHASIS-HF trial to reduce the risk of death and the risk of hospitalisation among patients with systolic heart failure.<br /><br />Ivabradine inhibits the If channel in the sinus node. Its only known pharmacological effect is to slow the heart rate in patients in sinus rhythm and data surrounding its use in heart failure is currently limited. <br /><br />Furosemide and other diuretics are used for the relief of congestive symptoms and fluid retention in patients with heart failure.  They can be titrated up or down according to need following the initiation of subsequent heart failure therapies.  They have no effect on mortality. ",

This class of drug are second line in the treatment of heart failure. Candesartan is licensed for use in heart failure, and can be used in patients intolerant of standard ACE inhibitors. Side effects include dizziness, headache, and hyperkalaemia.<br /><br />Spironolactone is an aldosterone antagonist which should be considered in all patients, especially those who have moderate to severe heart failure (NYHA class 3 or 4) or have had an MI within the past month.  Eplerenone is similar in its actions to spironolactone and was shown in the EMPHASIS-HF trial to reduce the risk of death and the risk of hospitalisation among patients with systolic heart failure.<br /><br />Ivabradine inhibits the If channel in the sinus node. Its only known pharmacological effect is to slow the heart rate in patients in sinus rhythm and data surrounding its use in heart failure is currently limited. <br /><br />Furosemide and other diuretics are used for the relief of congestive symptoms and fluid retention in patients with heart failure.  They can be titrated up or down according to need following the initiation of subsequent heart failure therapies.  They have no effect on mortality. ",

            "The correct answer is <b>Seborrhoeic dermatitis</b>. This condition is a common, chronic or relapsing form of eczema/dermatitis that primarily affects sebum-gland rich areas including the scalp, face, and trunk. The presentation of an itchy, red rash on the neck, behind the ears and around the nasolabial folds in this patient is highly suggestive of Seborrhoeic dermatitis. Notably, Parkinson's disease patients have a higher incidence of seborrhoeic dermatitis due to increased sebum production.<br /><br /><b>Levodopa associated dermatitis</b> is incorrect as it typically presents as xerosis (dry skin) and pruritus without a distinct rash. It would also likely affect other parts of the body rather than being localised to sebum-rich areas.<br /><br /><b>Flexural psoriasis</b> is not correct because this type of psoriasis usually affects skin folds such as those found in the axillae or groin. It generally does not affect the face or scalp which are commonly involved in seborrhoeic dermatitis.<br /><br />The option <b>Acne rosacea</b> is incorrect because rosacea typically presents with transient or persistent erythema, papules, pustules and telangiectasia on the face. Furthermore, rosacea does not cause itching which was one of the symptoms described by this patient.<br /><br />Finally, a <b>Fixed drug reaction to ropinirole</b>, used in Parkinson's disease treatment, is unlikely because fixed drug reactions usually present as well-defined erythematous patches or plaques that recur at exactly the same site with each exposure to the drug.

            "Presbycusis (or age-related hearing loss) occurs bilaterally and affects 1 in 3 adults over 65 years. It is a progressive, bilateral sensorineural hearing loss. Patients typically present with difficulty hearing high-pitch sounds, difficulty differentiating 's' and 'th', and finding women's voices more difficult to hear than men's. Word recognition is relatively preserved, but many eventually develop poor word distinction (particularly in crowded, noisy settings). This patient's audiogram is typical of presbyacusis:<br /><ul><li>Bilateral impairment</li><li>High-frequency hearing loss</li><li>Downward-sloping pure tone thresholds</li></ul> <br />An acoustic neuroma would most likely be unilateral and thus only cause hearing loss in one ear. Symptoms of vertigo and nausea/vomiting are common along with hearing loss. An audiogram is not the most sensitive test to detect acoustic neuromas, and you would not see the typical high-frequency loss pattern in this scenario. Note that an MRI head or auditory brainstem response testing should be used to diagnose an acoustic neuroma.<br /><br />A cholesteatoma would present with unilateral hearing loss (and may have intermittent episodes of ear discharge). Otoscopy would show a greasy, pearly-white lump in the 'attic' of the tympanic membrane. An audiogram will show a conductive hearing loss with an 'air-bone gap' > 10 decibels. An 'air-bone gap' is a measure of the difference in transmission in the middle ear with the difference in hearing in air versus hearing with the ear bones being directly stimulated with vibrations.<br /><br />An osteoma is an ear canal bony growth that is seen most commonly in cold-water swimmers.  Osteomas are rare and when they occur will typically cause ear pain and eventual hearing loss. Examination with otoscopy would show irregularly shaped, osseous tumours in the ear canal. There would be a conductive hearing loss (with an 'air-bone gap') seen on an audiogram. This patient has no history which would point towards this diagnosis (such as cold water swimming or ear pain) and there is no evidence of abnormality on otoscopy, as such this answer is incorrect.<br /><br />Otosclerosis is a hereditary condition where the stapes becomes fixed. Hearing loss with this condition becomes noticeable before middle-age (as such, the patient in the vignette would be considered old for otosclerosis onset) but it is highly variable. It causes a conductive hearing loss which would present with an air-bone gap bilaterally on an audiogram.",

An 'air-bone gap' is a measure of the difference in transmission in the middle ear with the difference in hearing in air versus hearing with the ear bones being directly stimulated with vibrations.<br /><br />An osteoma is an ear canal bony growth that is seen most commonly in cold-water swimmers.  Osteomas are rare and when they occur will typically cause ear pain and eventual hearing loss. Examination with otoscopy would show irregularly shaped, osseous tumours in the ear canal. There would be a conductive hearing loss (with an 'air-bone gap') seen on an audiogram. This patient has no history which would point towards this diagnosis (such as cold water swimming or ear pain) and there is no evidence of abnormality on otoscopy, as such this answer is incorrect.<br /><br />Otosclerosis is a hereditary condition where the stapes becomes fixed. Hearing loss with this condition becomes noticeable before middle-age (as such, the patient in the vignette would be considered old for otosclerosis onset) but it is highly variable. It causes a conductive hearing loss which would present with an air-bone gap bilaterally on an audiogram.",

        "body": "Age-related macular degeneration is the most common cause of blindness in the UK. Degeneration of the central retina (macula) is the key feature with changes usually bilateral. ARMD is characterised by degeneration of retinal photoreceptors that results in the formation of drusen which can be seen on fundoscopy and retinal photography. It is more common with advancing age and is more common in females.<br /><br />Risk factors<br /><ul><li>advancing age itself is the greatest risk factor for ARMD<ul><li>the risk of ARMD increases 3 fold for patients aged older than 75 years, versus those aged 65-74.</li></ul></li><li><span class=\"concept\" data-cid=\"640\">smoking</span><ul><li>current smokers are twice as likely as non-smokers to have ARMD related visual loss, and ex-smokers have a slightly increased risk of developing the condition, (OR 1.13). </li></ul></li><li>family history is also a strong risk factor for developing ARMD<ul><li>first degree relatives of a sufferer of ARMD are thought to be four times more likely to inherit the condition.</li></ul></li><li>other risk factors for developing the condition include those associated with an increased risk of ischaemic cardiovascular disease, such as hypertension, dyslipidaemia and diabetes mellitus. </li></ul><br /><br /><h5 class='notes-heading'>Classification</h5><br />Traditionally two forms of macular degeneration are seen:<br /><ul><li>dry macular degeneration<ul><li>90% of cases</li><li>also known as atrophic</li><li>characterised by <span class=\"concept\" data-cid=\"639\">drusen</span>  - yellow round spots in Bruch's membrane</li></ul></li><li>wet macular degeneration<ul><li>10% of cases</li><li>also known as exudative or neovascular macular degeneration</li><li>characterised by <span class=\"concept\" data-cid=\"11900\">choroidal neovascularisation</span></li><li>leakage of serous fluid and blood can subsequently result in a rapid loss of vision</li><li>carries the worst prognosis</li></ul></li></ul><br />Recently there has been a move to a more updated classification:<br /><ul><li>early age-related macular degeneration (non-exudative, age-related maculopathy): drusen and alterations to the retinal pigment epithelium (RPE)</li><li>late age-related macular degeneration (neovascularisation, exudative)</li></ul><br /><h5 class='notes-heading'>Clinical features</h5><br />Patients typically present with a subacute onset of visual loss with:<br /><ul><li>a reduction in visual acuity, particularly for near field objects<ul><li>gradual in dry ARMD </li><li>subacute in wet ARMD</li></ul></li><li><span class=\"concept\" data-cid=\"12500\">worse in the centre of vision</span> (e.g. difficulty reading, recognising faces, driving)</li><li>difficulties in dark adaptation with an overall deterioration in vision at night</li><li>fluctuations in visual disturbance which may vary significantly from day to day</li><li>they may also suffer from photopsia, (a perception of flickering or flashing lights), and glare around objects</li><li>visual hallucinations may also occur resulting in Charles-Bonnet syndrome</li></ul><br />Signs:<br /><ul><li>distortion of line perception may be noted on <span class=\"concept\" data-cid=\"11392\">Amsler grid testing</span></li><li>fundoscopy reveals the presence of drusen, yellow areas of pigment deposition in the macular area, which may become confluent in late disease to form a macular scar.</li><li>in wet ARMD well demarcated red patches may be seen which represent intra-retinal or sub-retinal fluid leakage or haemorrhage. </li></ul>   <br />Investigations:<br /><ul><li>slit-lamp microscopy is the initial investigation of choice, to identify any pigmentary, exudative or haemorrhagic changes affecting the retina which may identify the presence of ARMD.

The lesions are usually asymptomatic but may be associated with tenderness or itchiness.<br /><br /><b>Erythema nodosum</b> is an incorrect option as this condition usually presents as painful, red nodules on the anterior surface of the legs. It's often associated with systemic conditions such as inflammatory bowel disease, sarcoidosis or streptococcal infections. Erythema nodosum does not typically present with telangiectasia surrounding the lesions.<br /><br /><b>Neuropathic ulcer</b> would be an unlikely diagnosis in this case because neuropathic ulcers typically present in patients with long-standing diabetes who have lost sensation in their feet due to peripheral neuropathy. These ulcers generally occur over pressure points on the feet and do not present as erythematous lesions on the shins surrounded by telangiectasia.<br /><br /><b>Candidiasis</b> is another incorrect option. Although people with diabetes are at increased risk for fungal infections like candidiasis, this condition typically presents as itchy, red patches of skin often accompanied by a white curd-like substance. It most commonly affects skin folds rather than presenting as bilateral lesions on the shins.<br /><br />Lastly, <b>Granuloma annulare</b> can be ruled out because it typically presents as ring-shaped lesions that are often skin-coloured or slightly erythematous rather than being surrounded by telangiectasia.
