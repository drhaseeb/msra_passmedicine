            "The most likely diagnosis in this case is <b>Meniere's disease</b>. Meniere's disease is characterised by recurrent episodes of vertigo, fluctuating sensorineural hearing loss, and a sensation of fullness or pressure in the affected ear. These symptoms result from an accumulation of endolymphatic fluid within the inner ear, leading to increased pressure and subsequent dysfunction of the vestibular and cochlear systems. The exact cause of Meniere's disease remains unclear, but it is thought to involve a combination of genetic and environmental factors.<br /><br /><b>Benign paroxysmal positional vertigo (BPPV)</b> is another common cause of vertigo, but it is typically triggered by specific head movements or changes in position. BPPV occurs when otoconia (calcium carbonate crystals) become dislodged from the utricle and move into one or more semicircular canals, causing brief episodes of spinning vertigo as the head moves. This condition does not typically cause hearing loss or feelings of fullness in the ears.<br /><br />An <b>acoustic neuroma</b>, also known as a vestibular schwannoma, is a benign tumour arising from Schwann cells that surround the vestibulocochlear nerve (cranial nerve VIII). While these tumours can cause progressive hearing loss, tinnitus, and balance problems, they do not usually present with episodic vertigo or sensations of fullness in the ears. In addition, acoustic neuromas are relatively rare compared to Meniere's disease.<br /><br />A <b>cholesteatoma</b> is an abnormal growth of skin cells within the middle ear that can lead to erosion of surrounding structures and complications such as hearing loss, tinnitus, facial nerve paralysis, and even meningitis. However, cholesteatomas are not typically associated with episodic vertigo or sensations of fullness in the ears. They are usually identified on clinical examination as a white, keratin-filled mass behind the tympanic membrane.<br /><br />Finally, <b>somatisation</b> refers to the experience of physical symptoms that cannot be fully explained by a known medical condition. While it is possible for somatisation to manifest as dizziness or vertigo, the presence of hearing loss and sensations of fullness in the ears during episodes makes this diagnosis less likely in this case. Furthermore, somatisation would be considered a diagnosis of exclusion after other potential causes have been ruled out.",

            "The correct answer is Wilson's disease. This young patient presents with neurological symptoms including a resting tremor, bradykinesia, and behavioural changes, alongside Kayser-Fleischer rings (dark circular marks around the iris) and a family history of liver disease. Wilson's disease is an autosomal recessive condition causing copper accumulation in various tissues, particularly the liver and brain. The age of presentation, combination of neurological and ophthalmological findings, and family history of liver disease in a young relative are classical features of Wilson's disease.<br /><br /><b>Multiple sclerosis</b> typically presents with episodes of neurological dysfunction affecting different parts of the nervous system at different times (dissemination in time and space). While it can cause tremor, it would not typically cause Kayser-Fleischer rings or be associated with family history of liver disease.<br /><br /><b>Parkinson's disease</b>, while causing resting tremor and bradykinesia, typically affects older adults (usually over 50 years). It would not cause Kayser-Fleischer rings or be associated with liver disease. The young age of the patient makes this diagnosis very unlikely.<br /><br /><b>Alpha-1-antitrypsin deficiency</b> primarily affects the lungs (causing emphysema) and liver, but does not typically cause neurological symptoms. While it can cause cirrhosis, it would not explain the neurological features or Kayser-Fleischer rings seen in this patient.<br /><br /><b>Huntington's disease</b> is an autosomal dominant condition typically presenting in middle age with chorea, cognitive decline, and psychiatric symptoms.

            "Malrotation is most common in babies <30 days of age. It tends to present with bilious vomiting. The abdomen is typically soft and non-tender initially, but if not treated, it leads to strangulation of the gut. This is suggested in this scenario by the presence of a distended and firm abdomen, and the lack of stool.<br /><br />Appendicitis does not generally present in neonates. It becomes more common in children over the age of 3. Typical presenting features of appendicitis in children include right-sided abdominal pain, anorexia, fever, and vomiting. The child in this scenario has bilious vomiting, which would be unusual in appendicitis unless it had been going on for a long time.  <br /><br />Necrotising enterocolitis usually presents in neonates with abdominal pain, swelling, diarrhoea with bloody stool, green/yellow vomit, lethargy, refusal to eat, and lack of weight gain. It is more common in premature babies and tends to have a more insidious course, rather than presenting in an acutely unwell and dehydrated neonate.<br /><br />Vomiting associated with pyloric stenosis is non-bilious and is typically projectile. Its peak age of onset is age 4-8 weeks. Weight loss and dehydration are very common at presentation. On examination, there may be visible peristalsis and a palpable olive-sized pyloric mass, best felt during a feed. Lack of ability to pass stool and a distended abdomen are not usually features of this condition.<br /><br />Reflux is a common problem in infants. It usually starts before the baby is 8 weeks old, and tends to resolve by the time the child is one. Typical symptoms include bringing up milk or being sick during or shortly after feeding, coughing or hiccuping when feeding, being unsettled during feeding, swallowing or gulping after burping or feeding, or crying after feeding. Babies with reflux are not usually acutely unwell but may struggle to gain weight.",
