            "The likely cause of the mass in this scenario is an aspergilloma. An aspergilloma is a mass caused by the fungus aspergillus, which mainly affects pre-existing cavities, such as those caused by tuberculosis (which is likely in this case due to the high prevalence of tuberculosis in India), sarcoidosis and lung cancer. Signs and symptoms of an aspergilloma include haemoptysis, which may be massive and life-threatening, or less commonly haemoptysis or fever. <br /><br />Sarcoidosis is a cause of cavitating lung lesions however this would not explain the mass. There may also be additional radiographic signs such as bilateral hilar/ mediastinal lymphadenopathy, pulmonary fibrosis or pleural effusion. Additional symptoms may include dyspnoea and skin changes such as erythema nodosum. However, sarcoidosis is asymptomatic in up to 50% of patients. <br /><br />Small cell lung cancers are another cause of cavitating lung lesions, however due to the lack of a smoking history, this is unlikely. Small cell lung cancers are also more likely to affect the hilar or peri-hilar areas as opposed to the upper lobe.<br /><br />A squamous cell lung cancer is unlikely due to the lack of smoking history. These may present with pulmonary symptoms such as dyspnoea, haemoptysis and a chronic cough, or with a paraneoplastic syndrome such as syndrome of inappropriate anti-diuretic hormone (SIADH) or Cushing's syndrome. <br /><br />Tuberculosis is the likely cause of the cavitating lesion in this case due to the history of migration from an endemic area, and the absence of the previous testing. However, tuberculosis would not explain the mass, which is what the question is specifically asking about.",
