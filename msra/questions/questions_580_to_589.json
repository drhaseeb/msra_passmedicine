            "<b>Reassure and advise him to return if it starts to cause problems</b> is the correct answer. The most likely diagnosis here is a ganglion cyst, given its very classical location and appearance - as shown, they typically present as 1-2 cm lumps under the skin, most commonly on the dorsum of the hand. These typically do not need active treatment unless the patient is experiencing significant symptoms, which is not the case for this patient. <br /><br /><b>Routine referral to dermatology clinic</b> is incorrect. As described above, a ganglion cyst is the most likely diagnosis here, given the history. These commonly resolve spontaneously, but when treatment is needed, this would be via surgical teams. A dermatology clinic would be appropriate if a non-malignant skin condition were suspected.<br /><br /><b>Routine referral to surgical clinic</b> is incorrect. This might be appropriate if the patient were experiencing symptoms such as significant pain or reduced range of motion in the wrist. However, for asymptomatic ganglion cysts, as presented in this case, surgical removal is not required and would introduce surgical risks (e.g. infection) with little scope for benefit. <br /><br /><b>Two-week-wait referral to dermatology clinic</b> is incorrect. Ganglion cysts are benign conditions that do not require urgent treatment. This would be an appropriate answer if, for example, a malignant skin condition, such as melanoma, were suspected. However, as can be seen from the image, there are no changes to the overlying skin, which would be expected in a malignant skin condition. <br /><br /><b>Two-week-wait referral to haematology clinic</b> is incorrect. This is most likely a ganglion cyst, as described above, which would not require an urgent referral or a haematologist. Although the appearance is somewhat similar to an enlarged lymph node, the wrist is not home to any major lymph nodes, so it could not realistically house a tumour of the lymphatic system. His lack of constitutional symptoms (e.g. weight loss, night sweats) is also reassuring.",

            "The correct answer is <b>Alcohol</b>. This patient's symptoms are suggestive of cluster headaches, a primary headache disorder characterised by severe unilateral orbital or temporal pain, typically lasting 15-180 minutes and occurring once to eight times a day. Attacks often occur in clusters (hence the name), with periods of remission between clusters. During attacks, patients often appear restless or agitated and may exhibit autonomic symptoms such as conjunctival injection (red eye), lacrimation, nasal congestion or rhinorrhoea (clear nasal discharge) on the side of the headache. Alcohol is known to be a trigger for attacks during a cluster period but not during remission periods.<br /><br /><b>Opioid medications including codeine</b> are incorrect because they do not precipitate cluster headaches. However, they are generally avoided in management due to the risk of medication overuse headache and dependence.<br /><br /><b>Stress</b> is also incorrect. While stress can trigger migraines and tension-type headaches, it is not typically associated with triggering cluster headaches.<br /><br />Exposure to <b>Sunlight</b>, unlike some other types of headache such as migraine, is not known to trigger cluster headaches and thus this option is incorrect.<br /><br />Finally, <b>Excessive exercise</b> does not typically precipitate cluster headaches either. In fact, aerobic exercise has been shown to have a preventive effect on several types of primary headache disorders. Therefore this option is also incorrect.<br />",

This patient's symptoms are suggestive of cluster headaches, a primary headache disorder characterised by severe unilateral orbital or temporal pain, typically lasting 15-180 minutes and occurring once to eight times a day. Attacks often occur in clusters (hence the name), with periods of remission between clusters. During attacks, patients often appear restless or agitated and may exhibit autonomic symptoms such as conjunctival injection (red eye), lacrimation, nasal congestion or rhinorrhoea (clear nasal discharge) on the side of the headache. Alcohol is known to be a trigger for attacks during a cluster period but not during remission periods.<br /><br /><b>Opioid medications including codeine</b> are incorrect because they do not precipitate cluster headaches. However, they are generally avoided in management due to the risk of medication overuse headache and dependence.<br /><br /><b>Stress</b> is also incorrect. While stress can trigger migraines and tension-type headaches, it is not typically associated with triggering cluster headaches.<br /><br />Exposure to <b>Sunlight</b>, unlike some other types of headache such as migraine, is not known to trigger cluster headaches and thus this option is incorrect.<br /><br />Finally, <b>Excessive exercise</b> does not typically precipitate cluster headaches either. In fact, aerobic exercise has been shown to have a preventive effect on several types of primary headache disorders. Therefore this option is also incorrect.<br />",

It can be acute or chronic, localised or diffuse. A thorough understanding of the underlying pathophysiological mechanisms and potential causes is crucial for accurate diagnosis and effective management.<br /><br /><h5 class='notes-heading'>Background</h5><br />The abdominal cavity contains various organs including the stomach, liver, gallbladder, spleen, pancreas, kidneys, intestines and reproductive organs. Pain can originate from any of these structures or from the abdominal wall itself. The innervation of these organs is complex and involves somatic and visceral nerves which contribute to the nature and perception of pain.<br /><br /><h5 class='notes-heading'>Differential Diagnosis</h5><br />The table below gives characteristic exam question features for conditions causing abdominal pain.

            "The correct answer is <b>Gastro-oesophageal reflux disease</b>. Barrett's oesophagus is a condition in which the normal squamous epithelium of the oesophagus is replaced by columnar epithelium, typically as a result of chronic gastro-oesophageal reflux disease (GORD). GORD exposes the oesophagus to gastric acid and bile, causing inflammation and injury to the oesophageal mucosa. Over time, this can lead to metaplastic changes and the development of Barrett's oesophagus. According to UK guidelines, patients with Barrett's oesophagus should receive appropriate management for their GORD symptoms.<br /><br /><b>Use of NSAIDs</b>: Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) are known to cause gastrointestinal side effects such as dyspepsia and peptic ulcer disease. However, there is no strong evidence linking NSAID use to the development of Barrett's oesophagus specifically.<br /><br /><b>Eating smoked fish</b>: While some studies have suggested that certain dietary factors may be associated with an increased risk of developing Barrett's oesophagus or oesophageal adenocarcinoma, there is no consistent evidence that eating smoked fish has a significant impact on the risk of developing Barrett's oesophagus.<br /><br /><b>Alcohol</b>: Alcohol consumption has been linked to various gastrointestinal conditions, including GORD and oesophageal cancer. However, its association with Barrett's oesophagus remains unclear. Some studies suggest that alcohol may increase the risk while others report no significant association between alcohol intake and Barrett's oesophagus.<br /><br /><b>Smoking</b>: Smoking is a well-established risk factor for many diseases, including several types of cancer. While smoking has been shown to increase the risk of developing GORD and oesophageal adenocarcinoma, its association with Barrett's oesophagus is not as strong as that of GORD. Nevertheless, smoking cessation should still be recommended to patients with Barrett's oesophagus due to its numerous health benefits.<br /><br />In summary, GORD is the most strongly linked risk factor for the development of Barrett's oesophagus. While other factors such as NSAID use, diet, alcohol, and smoking may contribute to the overall risk profile, they do not have as significant an impact on the development of this condition as GORD does.",

        "title": "Haematuria",
        "body": "The management of patients with haematuria is often difficult due to the absence of widely followed guidelines. It is sometimes unclear whether patients are best managed in primary care, by urologists or by nephrologists.<br /><br />The terminology surrounding haematuria is changing. Microscopic or dipstick positive haematuria is increasingly termed non-visible haematuria whilst macroscopic haematuria is termed visible haematuria. Non-visible haematuria is found in around 2.5% of the population.<br /><br />Causes of transient or spurious non-visible haematuria<br /><ul><li>urinary tract infection</li><li>menstruation</li><li>vigorous exercise (this normally settles after around 3 days)</li><li>sexual intercourse</li></ul><br />Causes of persistent non-visible haematuria<br /><ul><li>cancer (bladder, renal, prostate)</li><li>stones</li><li>benign prostatic hyperplasia</li><li>prostatitis</li><li>urethritis e.g. <i>Chlamydia</i></li><li>renal causes: IgA nephropathy, thin basement membrane disease</li><li><span class=\"concept\" data-cid=\"12466\">thin basement membrane disease</span><ul><li>hereditary nephropathy characterised by diffuse thinning of the glomerular basement membrane (GBM), leading to persistent microscopic haematuria</li><li>autosomal dominant with variable penetrance</li><li>estimated to affect 1\u20135% of the general population worldwide</li><li>excellent prognosis</li></ul></li></ul><br />Spurious causes - red/orange urine, where blood is not present on dipstick<br /><ul><li>foods: beetroot, rhubarb</li><li>drugs: rifampicin, doxorubicin</li></ul><br /><h5 class='notes-heading'>Management</h5><br />Current evidence does not support screening for haematuria. The incidence of non-visible haematuria is similar in patients taking aspirin/warfarin to the general population hence these patients should also be investigated.<br /><br />Testing<br /><ul><li>urine dipstick is the test of choice for detecting haematuria</li><li>persistent non-visible haematuria is often defined as blood being present in 2 out of 3 samples tested 2-3 weeks apart</li><li>renal function, albumin:creatinine (ACR) or protein:creatinine ratio (PCR) and blood pressure should also be checked</li><li>urine microscopy may be used but time to analysis significantly affects the number of red blood cells detected</li></ul><br />NICE urgent cancer referral guidelines were updated in 2015.<br /><br /><h5 class='notes-heading'>Urgent referral (i.e. within 2 weeks)</h5><br />Aged >= 45 years AND:<br /><ul><li>unexplained visible haematuria without urinary tract infection, or</li><li>visible haematuria that persists or recurs after successful treatment of urinary tract infection</li></ul><br />Aged >= 60 years AND have unexplained nonvisible haematuria and either dysuria or a raised white cell count on a blood test<br /><br /><h5 class='notes-heading'>Non-urgent referral</h5><br />Aged 60  >= 60 years with recurrent or persistent unexplained urinary tract infection<br /><br />Since the investigation (or not) of non-visible haematuria is such as a common dilemma a number of guidelines have been published. They generally agree with NICE guidance, of note:<br /><ul><li>patients under the age of 40 years with normal renal function, no proteinuria and who are normotensive do not need to be referred and may be managed in primary care</li></ul>",
