            "<b>Advise stopping omeprazole for 2 weeks then perform a urea breath test</b> is the correct answer. According to UK NICE guidelines (NG184), the first-line investigation for suspected <i>H. pylori</i> in patients under 55 with no alarm symptoms is a non-invasive test. The two recommended tests are the 13C-urea breath test or the stool antigen test. Both tests rely on detecting active bacterial presence. Proton pump inhibitors (PPIs) like omeprazole suppress <i>H. pylori</i> activity, including the production of the urease enzyme which is fundamental to the mechanism of the urea breath test. This suppression can lead to a false-negative result. Therefore, to ensure the accuracy of the test, it is essential that the patient stops taking any PPIs for at least two weeks before the test is performed. Similarly, any antibiotic use should be stopped for at least four weeks. This patient has no alarm features, so a 'test and treat' strategy is appropriate, and advising a washout period before the most sensitive non-invasive test is the correct management.<br /><br /><b>Arrange an immediate urea breath test</b> is incorrect. Performing the test while the patient is actively taking a PPI would significantly increase the likelihood of a false-negative result. The patient's recent use of omeprazole for three weeks will have suppressed the bacterial load and its urease activity, rendering the test unreliable. The test should be delayed until after the recommended two-week washout period to maximise its diagnostic accuracy.<br /><br /><b>Arrange a serum H. pylori antibody test</b> is not the most appropriate next step. While serology is a non-invasive test for <i>H. pylori</i>, it has lower sensitivity and specificity compared to the urea breath test or stool antigen test. A major limitation is that it detects IgG antibodies, which can remain positive for years even after successful eradication of the infection. Therefore, it cannot reliably distinguish between a current, active infection and a past, resolved infection. NICE guidelines recommend the urea breath test or stool antigen test as the preferred first-line non-invasive methods.<br /><br /><b>Arrange an immediate stool antigen test</b> is incorrect for the same reason that an immediate urea breath test is incorrect. The stool antigen test also detects active infection and its accuracy is similarly compromised by recent PPI use. The same recommendation applies: PPIs must be stopped for at least two weeks before the test is performed to avoid a false-negative result. While a stool antigen test is a valid alternative to the urea breath test, performing it immediately is inappropriate.<br /><br /><b>Refer for upper GI endoscopy</b> is not indicated at this stage. An urgent referral for endoscopy is reserved for patients with dyspepsia who have alarm features (such as anaemia, weight loss, dysphagia, persistent vomiting, or an epigastric mass) or for those aged 55 and over with new-onset dyspepsia. This 45-year-old patient has no alarm features mentioned. The recommended management pathway is a non-invasive 'test and treat' strategy, which is more cost-effective and less invasive for this low-risk patient group.",

            "The correct answer is 5th metacarpal 'Boxer's' fracture. This injury commonly occurs when someone punches a hard surface with a clenched fist, causing an axial load along the metacarpal shaft. The fifth metacarpal is particularly vulnerable due to its relatively mobile nature and its position on the ulnar aspect of the hand. The fracture typically results in volar angulation of the metacarpal head due to the pull of the interossei muscles. The presentation of ulnar-sided hand pain and swelling following a punch injury is highly characteristic of this fracture pattern.<br /><br /><b>Tendon rupture</b> is less likely in this scenario. While tendon injuries can occur with direct trauma, they are more commonly associated with cutting injuries or forceful pulling against resistance. Additionally, tendon ruptures typically present with loss of specific movements rather than generalised pain and swelling.<br /><br /><b>Ulnar dislocation</b> is an uncommon injury that typically occurs with high-energy trauma or falls onto an outstretched hand. The mechanism described (punching) would be unlikely to cause dislocation of the ulna, which would also present with more widespread forearm pain and deformity.<br /><br /><b>Scaphoid fracture</b> typically occurs following a fall onto an outstretched hand with the wrist in extension. The mechanism of punching a wall would not typically cause this injury, and the pain would be localised to the anatomical snuffbox rather than the ulnar side of the hand.<br /><br /><b>1st metacarpal fracture</b>, also known as Bennett's fracture when involving the base, typically occurs from axial loading of the partially flexed thumb. This would be unlikely with a direct punch using a clenched fist, where the thumb is typically tucked and protected. The pain would also be localised to the radial aspect of the hand rather than the ulnar side.",

            "The most appropriate management for a 3-year-old child presenting with 'cross-eyed' or strabismus symptoms, confirmed by the corneal light reflection test, is to <b>refer to ophthalmology</b>. This is because strabismus can lead to amblyopia (lazy eye), which if left untreated can result in permanent vision loss. Early referral allows for assessment and treatment if necessary, which may include glasses, patching or surgery. According to UK guidelines, any child under the age of 4 years with suspected squint should be referred to an ophthalmologist immediately.<br /><br />The option <b>advise that referral to secondary care should be delayed until 5 years of age, when surgery may be contemplated</b>, is incorrect. Delaying referral and treatment could potentially allow the development of amblyopia, which can lead to irreversible visual loss. Furthermore, surgical intervention may not always be required as treatment will depend on the type and cause of the squint.<br /><br />The suggestion to <b>refer to paediatric physiotherapy for eye movement exercises</b> is also inappropriate in this case. While eye exercises may help certain types of strabismus where there is poor eye muscle coordination (convergence insufficiency), they are generally not effective for other forms of squint.<br /><br />Reassuring the mother that <b>the majority of squints improve with age</b> is misleading and potentially dangerous advice. While some children may outgrow intermittent or small-angle squints, many do not. Furthermore, persistent squints can lead to complications such as lazy eye or psychosocial problems related to appearance.<br /><br />Lastly, referring the child <b>to optometry for an eye-patch</b> without a comprehensive evaluation by an ophthalmologist could delay necessary treatment. Eye patches are commonly used in treating lazy eye (amblyopia) rather than strabismus itself - they force the brain to use the 'weaker' eye by covering up the stronger one.

It is supplied for local anaesthetic purposes as a paste.</li><li>It is supplied for clinical use in concentrations of 4 and 10%. It may be applied topically to the nasal mucosa. It has a rapid onset of action and has the additional advantage of causing marked vasoconstriction.</li><li>It is lipophillic and will readily cross the blood brain barrier. Its systemic effects also include cardiac arrhythmias and tachycardia.</li><li>Apart from its limited use in ENT surgery it is otherwise used rarely in mainstream surgical practice.</li></ul><br /><b>Bupivacaine</b><br /><ul><li>Bupivacaine binds to the intracellular portion of sodium channels and blocks sodium influx into nerve cells, which prevents depolarization.</li><li>It has a much longer duration of action than lignocaine and this is of use in that it may be used for topical wound infiltration at the conclusion of surgical procedures with long duration analgesic effect.</li><li>It is cardiotoxic and is therefore contra indicated in regional blockage in case the tourniquet fails.</li><li>Levobupivicaine (Chirocaine) is less cardiotoxic and causes less vasodilation.</li></ul><br /><b>Prilocaine</b><br /><ul><li>Similar mechanism of action to other local anaesthetic agents. However, it is far less cardiotoxic and is therefore the agent of choice for intravenous regional anaesthesia e.g. Biers Block.</li></ul><br />All local anaesthetic agents dissociate in tissues and this contributes to their therapeutic effect.
