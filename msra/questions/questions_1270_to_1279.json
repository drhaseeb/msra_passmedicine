            "The correct answer is <b>Depo Provera (injectable contraceptive)</b>. This is because Depo Provera, which contains the hormone medroxyprogesterone acetate, has been associated with a decrease in bone mineral density (BMD) in some women. This effect seems to be related to the duration of use and may not be completely reversible after discontinuation of the medication. The UK National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) recommends considering other methods of contraception if long-term use of Depo Provera is anticipated, particularly in adolescents and young women who have not yet reached peak bone mass.<br /><br />The option <b>Progestogen only pill</b> is incorrect. Although progestogen-only pills can cause irregular menstrual bleeding patterns, there's no evidence that they lead to decreased BMD. In fact, they are often used as an alternative for women who cannot take oestrogen-containing contraceptives due to medical contraindications.<br /><br /><b>Mirena (intrauterine system)</b> also does not decrease BMD. Mirena releases levonorgestrel directly into the uterus, which leads to local effects on the endometrium but minimal systemic absorption. Therefore, it doesn't affect bone metabolism or BMD.<br /><br />The option <b>Implanon (implantable contraceptive)</b> is incorrect as well. Implanon releases etonogestrel subdermally and although it can cause side effects such as changes in menstrual bleeding patterns and mood changes, it does not decrease BMD.<br /><br />Lastly, the <b>Combined oral contraceptive pill</b>, which contains both oestrogen and a progestogen, actually has a protective effect on BMD. Oestrogen inhibits bone resorption while progestogen supports bone formation; therefore combined oral contraceptives may increase BMD over time.<br />",

            "The correct answer is <b>Nicorandil</b>. Sildenafil is a phosphodiesterase-5 (PDE5) inhibitor used for the treatment of erectile dysfunction. It works by enhancing the effect of nitric oxide in the body, which leads to vasodilation and increased blood flow into the penis during sexual stimulation. Nicorandil, on the other hand, is a potassium channel activator with a nitrate component. The concurrent use of sildenafil and nicorandil can lead to an excessive drop in blood pressure due to their combined vasodilatory effects. This could potentially result in life-threatening hypotension or myocardial infarction, especially in patients with underlying ischaemic heart disease.<br /><br /><b>Nebivolol</b> is a beta-blocker used primarily for managing hypertension and heart failure. It does not interact significantly with sildenafil and hence would not contraindicate its use.<br /><br /><b>Losartan</b> is an angiotensin II receptor antagonist used for treating hypertension and diabetic nephropathy. Like nebivolol, it lacks significant interaction with sildenafil and thus would not contraindicate its use.<br /><br /><b>Nifedipine</b> is a calcium channel blocker utilised in managing hypertension and angina pectoris. While it can cause vasodilation like sildenafil, its concomitant use does not typically result in excessive hypotension as seen with nicorandil.<br /><br />Lastly, <b>Ramipril</b>, an angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor used for treating hypertension and reducing cardiovascular risks post-myocardial infarction, also has no significant interaction with sildenafil that would contraindicate its use.",

            "The correct answer is <b>Adenomyosis</b>. Adenomyosis is a condition where endometrial tissue grows within the myometrium of the uterus, causing uterine enlargement and heavy, painful menstrual periods. Secondary dysmenorrhoea is characterised by menstrual pain that develops after a history of pain-free periods, typically due to underlying pathology. Adenomyosis commonly presents in multiparous women in their late 30s and 40s with progressively worsening menstrual pain, making it a classic cause of secondary dysmenorrhoea.<br /><br /><b>Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS)</b> is an endocrine disorder characterised by irregular menstruation, hyperandrogenism, and polycystic ovaries. While PCOS can cause menstrual irregularities and pelvic discomfort, it is not typically associated with secondary dysmenorrhoea. The primary menstrual symptoms in PCOS are oligomenorrhoea or amenorrhoea.<br /><br /><b>Hypothyroidism</b> can affect the menstrual cycle, typically causing menorrhagia (heavy menstrual bleeding) and irregular periods. However, it is not a primary cause of secondary dysmenorrhoea. The main reproductive symptoms are related to changes in cycle length and flow rather than pain.<br /><br /><b>Premature ovarian failure</b> results in amenorrhoea and symptoms of oestrogen deficiency before the age of 40. While patients may experience various symptoms related to hormonal changes, secondary dysmenorrhoea is not a characteristic feature as menstruation has usually ceased.<br /><br /><b>Bacterial vaginosis</b> is a common vaginal infection characterised by an overgrowth of anaerobic bacteria. While it can cause vaginal discharge and discomfort, it does not cause secondary dysmenorrhoea. The symptoms are typically confined to vaginal symptoms rather than menstrual pain.",
