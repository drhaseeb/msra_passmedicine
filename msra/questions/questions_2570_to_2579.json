        "body": "Patients are at risk of a number of immediate, early and late complications following a myocardial infarction (MI).<br /><br /><h5 class='notes-heading'>Cardiac arrest</h5><br />This most commonly occurs due to patients developing ventricular fibrillation and is the most common cause of death following a MI. Patients are managed as per the ALS protocol with defibrillation.<br /><br /><h5 class='notes-heading'>Cardiogenic shock</h5><br />If a large part of the ventricular myocardium is damaged in the infarction the ejection fraction of the heart may decrease to the point that the patient develops cardiogenic shock. This is difficult to treat. Other causes of cardiogenic shock include the 'mechanical' complications such as left ventricular free wall rupture as listed below. Patients may require inotropic support and/or an intra-aortic balloon pump.<br /><br /><h5 class='notes-heading'>Chronic heart failure</h5><br />As described above, if the patient survives the acute phase their ventricular myocardium may be dysfunctional resulting in chronic heart failure. Loop diuretics such as furosemide will decrease fluid overload. Both ACE-inhibitors and beta-blockers have been shown to improve the long-term prognosis of patients with chronic heart failure.<br /><br /><h5 class='notes-heading'>Tachyarrhythmias</h5><br /><span class=\"concept\" data-cid=\"6891\">Ventricular fibrillation</span>, as mentioned above, is the most common cause of death following a MI. Other common arrhythmias including ventricular tachycardia.<br /><br /><h5 class='notes-heading'>Bradyarrhythmias</h5><br />Atrioventricular block is more common following <span class=\"concept\" data-cid=\"7726\">inferior myocardial infarctions</span>.<br /><br /><h5 class='notes-heading'>Pericarditis</h5><br /><span class=\"concept\" data-cid=\"4052\">Pericarditis in the first 48 hours following a transmural MI is common</span> (c. 10% of patients). The pain is typical for pericarditis (worse on lying flat etc), a pericardial rub may be heard and a pericardial effusion may be demonstrated with an echocardiogram.<br /><br /><span class=\"concept\" data-cid=\"6892\">Dressler's syndrome</span> tends to occur around <span class=\"concept\" data-cid=\"1868\">2-6 weeks</span> following a MI. The underlying pathophysiology is thought to be an autoimmune reaction against antigenic proteins formed as the myocardium recovers. It is characterised by a combination of <span class=\"concept\" data-cid=\"6897\">fever</span>, <span class=\"concept\" data-cid=\"6898\">pleuritic pain</span>, pericardial effusion and a raised ESR. It is treated with NSAIDs.<br /><br /><span class=\"concept\" data-cid=\"6893\"><h5 class='notes-heading'>Left ventricular aneurysm</h5></span><br /><br />The ischaemic damage sustained may weaken the myocardium resulting in aneurysm formation. This is typically associated with <span class=\"concept\" data-cid=\"6900\">persistent ST elevation</span> and left ventricular failure. Thrombus may form within the aneurysm increasing the risk of stroke. Patients are therefore anticoagulated.<br /><br /><div class=\"container\"><div class=\"row\"><div class=\"col-md-3\"><a href=\"https://d32xxyeh8kfs8k.cloudfront.net/images_Passmedicine/ecg095b.png\" data-fancybox=\"gallery\" data-caption=\"Left ventricular aneurysm.

Patients present with acute heart failure secondary to cardiac tamponade (<span class=\"concept\" data-cid=\"6899\">raised JVP, pulsus paradoxus</span>, diminished heart sounds). Urgent pericardiocentesis and thoracotomy are required.<br /><br /><span class=\"concept\" data-cid=\"6895\"><h5 class='notes-heading'>Ventricular septal defect</h5></span><br /><br />Rupture of the interventricular septum usually occurs in the first week and is seen in around 1-2% of patients. Features: acute heart failure associated with a pan-systolic murmur. An echocardiogram is diagnostic and will exclude acute mitral regurgitation which presents in a similar fashion. Urgent surgical correction is needed.<br /><br /><h5 class='notes-heading'>Acute mitral regurgitation</h5><br />More common with infero-posterior infarction and may be due to <span class=\"concept\" data-cid=\"5382\">ischaemia or rupture of the papillary muscle</span>. Acute hypotension and <span class=\"concept\" data-cid=\"9166\">pulmonary oedema</span> may occur. An early-to-mid systolic murmur is typically heard.

According to UK guidelines, oral antivirals are now the first-line treatment for post-exposure prophylaxis in at-risk groups, including pregnant women.

In this case, the patient presents 8 days after her son developed chickenpox, making this the optimal time to initiate treatment. Pregnancy is a high-risk condition for severe varicella infection, with potential complications for both mother and fetus. The negative VZV IgG confirms her susceptibility.

            "The correct answer is papillary carcinoma. It is the most common type of thyroid cancer, accounting for 70% of the cases. It usually presents in young females with a neck lump  with tendency to spread to cervical lymph nodes early and it has an excellent prognosis.<br /><br />Anaplastic carcinoma presents with a rapidly growing neck mass that gives her pressure symptoms (difficulty swallowing). This type of cancer represents 1% of thyroid cancers, it is not responsive to treatment and has a very poor prognosis. <br /><br />Follicular adenoma will usually present as a solitary thyroid nodule, with a firm to hard consistency and it is typically painless. It usually grows slowly. <br /><br />Follicular carcinoma has a peak onset ages 40 through 60. The most common presentation of thyroid cancer is an asymptomatic thyroid mass or nodule that can be felt in the neck. <br /><br />Medullary carcinoma arises from C cells derived from the neural crest and not thyroid tissue. As a consequence, serum calcitonin levels are often raised.",
