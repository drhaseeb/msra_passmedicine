            "The correct answer is <b>Autosomal recessive inheritance</b>. Essential tremor, a common movement disorder, typically exhibits an autosomal dominant pattern of inheritance rather than autosomal recessive. This means that only one copy of the altered gene in each cell is sufficient to cause the disorder. In most cases, an affected person has one parent with the condition. <br /><br /><b>Improved by alcohol</b> is incorrect as this is a known feature of essential tremor. Alcohol can transiently improve the symptoms of essential tremor but it's not recommended as a treatment due to the potential for misuse and alcohol-related harm.<br /><br />Next, <b>Improved by propranolol</b> is also incorrect because propranolol, a non-selective beta blocker, is indeed used as first-line therapy for essential tremor according to NICE guidelines. It helps reduce the amplitude of the tremors.<br /><br /><b>Titubation</b>, which refers to a bobbing or rhythmic swaying of the head and trunk, can be seen in essential tremor and hence makes this option incorrect too. However, it's more commonly associated with cerebellar disorders.<br /><br />Finally, <b>worse on intentional movement</b> is another key characteristic of essential tremor making this option incorrect. The tremor often becomes more noticeable during goal-directed tasks such as writing or lifting objects. In contrast, Parkinsonian tremors are typically worse at rest and improve with intentional movement.<br />",

            "<b>Acetylcholine receptor antibodies</b> are the most appropriate first-line investigation for this patient with suspected myasthenia gravis. The clinical presentation of fatigable ptosis and diplopia that worsens with sustained activity and throughout the day is highly characteristic of myasthenia gravis. Acetylcholine receptor antibodies are positive in approximately 85-90% of patients with generalised myasthenia gravis, making this the single most useful serological test. It is non-invasive, widely available, and has high specificity for the diagnosis. The presence of these antibodies confirms the autoimmune nature of the condition and supports the diagnosis without the need for more invasive testing. Normal pupillary reflexes help distinguish this from a third nerve palsy or other structural causes. While antibodies may be less commonly positive in purely ocular myasthenia (around 50%), this patient's symptoms suggest early generalised disease, making acetylcholine receptor antibody testing the most appropriate initial investigation.<br /><br /><b>Anti-voltage gated calcium channel antibodies</b> are associated with Lambert-Eaton myasthenic syndrome (LEMS), not myasthenia gravis. LEMS typically presents with proximal muscle weakness affecting the lower limbs more than upper limbs, with autonomic features such as dry mouth and reduced reflexes that improve with repeated testing. Ocular and bulbar muscles are usually spared or affected late in LEMS, making this diagnosis unlikely in a patient presenting primarily with ptosis and diplopia. The pattern of fatigability in this case is more consistent with myasthenia gravis.<br /><br /><b>CT head with contrast</b> would be appropriate if a structural lesion such as a tumour, aneurysm, or demyelinating lesion was suspected. However, the fatigable nature of the symptoms, their worsening throughout the day, and improvement with rest are not consistent with a structural cause. Additionally, bilateral ptosis with normal pupils and the absence of other focal neurological signs make a structural intracranial lesion unlikely. Imaging would not be the most appropriate initial investigation in this clinical context.<br /><br /><b>Muscle-specific tyrosine kinase antibodies</b> are found in approximately 40% of patients who are seronegative for acetylcholine receptor antibodies. While they are important in the diagnostic workup of myasthenia gravis, they should not be the first-line investigation. The standard approach is to test for acetylcholine receptor antibodies first, as these are positive in the majority of cases. Muscle-specific tyrosine kinase antibody testing is reserved for patients who have a high clinical suspicion of myasthenia gravis but are acetylcholine receptor antibody negative.<br /><br /><b>Tensilon test</b> involves the administration of intravenous edrophonium, a short-acting acetylcholinesterase inhibitor, which temporarily improves muscle weakness in myasthenia gravis. While this test was historically used for diagnosis, it is now rarely performed in the UK due to the risk of cardiac arrhythmias and other adverse effects, as well as the availability of safer and more reliable serological testing. The Tensilon test requires cardiac monitoring and resuscitation facilities, making it impractical as a first-line investigation when non-invasive antibody testing is available.",

        "body": "A subdural haematoma is a collection of blood deep to the dural layer of the meninges. The blood is not within the substance of the brain and is therefore called an 'extra-axial' or 'extrinsic' lesion. They can be unilateral or bilateral.<br /><br />Subdural haematomas can be classified in terms of their age:<br /><ul><li><b>Acute</b>: Symptoms usually develop within 48 hours of injury, characterised by rapid neurological deterioration</li><li><b>Subacute</b>: Symptoms manifest within days to weeks post-injury, with a more gradual progression.</li><li><b>Chronic</b>: Common in the elderly, developing over weeks to months. Patients may not recall a specific head injury.</li></ul><br />The typical presentation of a subdural haematoma (SDH) often involves a history of head trauma, which may range from minor to severe. Patients frequently exhibit a lucid interval followed by a gradual decline in consciousness. This pattern is particularly common in chronic SDH. Other hallmark features include headache, confusion, and lethargy.<br /><br /><h5 class='notes-heading'>Clinical Features</h5><br />Neurological Symptoms:<br /><ul><li>Altered Mental Status: Ranging from mild confusion to deep coma. <span class=\"concept\" data-cid=\"619\">Fluctuations in the level of consciousness are common.</span></li><li>Focal Neurological Deficits: Weakness on one side of the body, aphasia, or visual field defects, depending on the haematoma's location.</li><li>Headache: Often localised to one side, worsening over time.</li><li>Seizures: May occur, particularly in acute or expanding hematomas.</li></ul><br />Physical Examination Findings:<br /><ul><li>Papilloedema: Indicates raised intracranial pressure.</li><li>Pupil Changes: Unilateral dilated pupil, especially on the side of the haematoma, indicating compression of the third cranial nerve.</li><li>Gait Abnormalities: Including ataxia or weakness in one leg.</li><li>Hemiparesis or Hemiplegia: Reflecting the mass effect and midline shift.</li></ul><br />Behavioural and Cognitive Changes:<br /><ul><li>Memory Loss: Especially in chronic SDH.</li><li>Personality Changes: Irritability, apathy, or depression.</li><li>Cognitive Impairment: Difficulty with attention, problem-solving, and other executive functions.</li></ul><br />Other Associated Features:<br /><ul><li>Nausea and Vomiting: Secondary to increased intracranial pressure.</li><li>Drowsiness: Progressing to stupor and coma in severe cases.</li><li>Signs of Increased Intracranial Pressure: Such as bradycardia, hypertension, and respiratory irregularities (Cushing's triad).</li></ul><br />Although the collection of blood is within the same anatomical compartment, acute and chronic subdurals have important differences in terms of their mechanisms, associated clinical features and management:<br /><br /><h5 class='notes-heading'>Acute subdural haematoma</h5><br />An acute subdural haematoma is a collection of fresh blood within the subdural space and is most commonly caused by high-impact trauma. Since it is associated with high-impact injuries, there is often other brain underlying brain injuries.<br /><br />There is a spectrum of severity of symptoms and presentation depending on the size of the compressive acute subdural haematoma and the associated injuries. Presentation ranges from an incidental finding in trauma to severe coma and coning due to herniation.<br /><br />CT imaging is the first-line investigation and will show a crescentic collection, not limited by suture lines. They will appear hyperdense (bright) in comparison to the brain. Large acute subdural haematomas will push on the brain ('mass effect') and cause midline shift or herniation.<br /><br />Small or incidental acute subdurals can be observed conservatively. Surgical options include monitoring of intracranial pressure and decompressive craniectomy.<br /><br /><br /><h5 class='notes-heading'>Chronic subdural haematoma</h5><br />A chronic subdural haematoma is a collection of blood within the subdural space that has been present for weeks to months. <br /><br />Rupture of the small bridging veins within the subdural space rupture and cause slow bleeding. Elderly and alcoholic patients are particularly at risk of subdural haematomas since they have brain atrophy and therefore fragile or taut bridging veins. <br /><br />Presentation is typically a several week to month progressive history of either confusion, reduced consciousness or neurological deficit.<br /><br />Infants also have fragile bridging veins and can rupture in shaken baby syndrome.<br /><br />On CT imaging they similarly are crescentic in shape, not restricted by suture lines and compress the brain ('mass effect'). In contrast to acute subdurals, chronic subdurals are <span class=\"concept\" data-cid=\"5102\">hypodense (dark)</span> compared to the substance of the brain.<br /><br /><div class=\"container\"><div class=\"row\"><div class=\"col-md-3\"><a href=\"https://d32xxyeh8kfs8k.cloudfront.net/images_Passmedicine/xrb946b.jpg\" data-fancybox=\"gallery\" data-caption=\"CT (non-contrast) showing subdural haematoma in an elderly woman.

            "The correct answer is <b>Plasma aldosterone/renin ratio</b>. This patient presents with treatment-resistant hypertension (uncontrolled on three agents) and hypokalaemia. This combination is highly suggestive of primary hyperaldosteronism (PA), also known as Conn's syndrome when caused by an adenoma. In PA, the adrenal glands autonomously produce excess aldosterone, leading to sodium and water retention (causing hypertension) and increased potassium excretion (causing hypokalaemia). This high aldosterone level suppresses renin secretion from the kidneys via negative feedback. Therefore, the most appropriate initial screening test, as recommended by Endocrine Society and UK guidelines, is the measurement of plasma aldosterone and renin to calculate a ratio. A high ratio is the key biochemical finding that confirms the need for further investigation.<br /><br /><b>CT abdomen</b> is an important investigation in the workup of primary hyperaldosteronism, but it is not the initial step. Its purpose is to localise the source of aldosterone excess (e.g., a unilateral adrenal adenoma vs bilateral adrenal hyperplasia) <i>after</i> a biochemical diagnosis has been established. Performing imaging before biochemical confirmation can be misleading, as non-functioning adrenal incidentalomas are relatively common and may not be the cause of the hypertension. The biochemical diagnosis must be secured first before proceeding to anatomical localisation.<br /><br /><b>Renal artery doppler ultrasound</b> is used to investigate for renal artery stenosis, which is another significant cause of secondary hypertension. In renovascular hypertension, reduced renal perfusion activates the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system, leading to high renin and consequently high aldosterone levels. While this is a valid differential for resistant hypertension, the presence of spontaneous hypokalaemia in this patient makes primary hyperaldosteronism (a low-renin state) a more likely diagnosis. The aldosterone/renin ratio is therefore a more targeted initial test in this specific clinical context.<br /><br /><b>24-hour urinary metanephrines</b> is the recommended screening test for phaeochromocytoma, a catecholamine-secreting tumour. While phaeochromocytoma causes hypertension, the classical presentation involves paroxysmal symptoms such as headaches, palpitations, and sweating. This patient's presentation of stable resistant hypertension and hypokalaemia, without these paroxysmal features, points more strongly towards an excess of mineralocorticoids rather than catecholamines. Therefore, screening for primary hyperaldosteronism is the more logical first step.<br /><br /><b>Adrenal venous sampling (AVS)</b> is a specialised, invasive procedure used to differentiate between a unilateral aldosterone-producing adenoma and bilateral adrenal hyperplasia. It is considered the gold standard for lateralisation of the aldosterone source and is crucial for determining whether a patient is a candidate for surgical cure (adrenalectomy). However, AVS is only performed after the diagnosis of primary hyperaldosteronism has been confirmed biochemically and is typically used when imaging is inconclusive or surgery is being planned.
