            "Missed combined oral contraceptive pills (COCPs) can be a complex topic as it relies on the number of missed pills and the current week of the treatment cycle. In many cases, the first 3 weeks of the COCP are active pills and the 4th week is a pill-free interval (either with no tablets or with placebos).  As this woman has missed 2 pills, she is unable to simply take an active pill and continue as normal. Instead, she should take an active pill and continue with her current pack. Once she reaches her planned pill-free interval, she should omit this and move straight onto the next pack. During this time, she should also be aware that she may have reduced contraceptive protection.<br /><br />'Seek emergency contraception' is an incorrect answer. As this woman has not had unprotected sexual intercourse during the period of missed pills, it is not required to seek emergency contraception.<br /><br />'Take an active pill and continue with the upcoming pill-free interval' is incorrect. Whilst she should take an active pill, she should omit her pill-free interval as she has already likely lost her contraceptive protection during the missed pill days and therefore should aim to continue with active pills.<br /><br />'Take an active pill as soon as possible. No further precautions required' is incorrect. This is the advice recommend for women who have missed a single dose of the pill. As this patient has missed 2 pills, she is likely to have reduced contraceptive protection and should therefore take an active pill and exercise caution.<br /><br />'Take 2 active pills and continue as normal' is not correct. It would not make sense to take both active pills together and continue as normal as she is likely to have reduced contraceptive protection. Instead, she should take 1 active pill and omit her upcoming pill-free interval.",

            "The correct answer is <b>Arthritis</b>. Arthritis is the most common extra-intestinal manifestation of Crohn's disease, affecting up to 30% of patients. This can include both peripheral arthritis and axial arthritis (also known as spondyloarthropathy). The pathogenesis is not fully understood but it is thought to be due to an immune response triggered by the gastrointestinal inflammation.<br /><br /><b>Episcleritis</b> is an incorrect option. While episcleritis can occur in Crohn's disease, it is much less common than arthritis. Episcleritis involves inflammation of the episclera, a thin layer of tissue between the conjunctiva and the sclera of the eye. It typically presents with redness and mild pain in one or both eyes.<br /><br /><b>Erythema nodosum</b>, although being one of the cutaneous manifestations associated with Crohn's disease, it is not as common as arthritis. Erythema nodosum presents as painful, red nodules usually located on the shins. It represents a hypersensitivity reaction to various triggers including infections and drugs.<br /><br /><b>Uveitis</b>, like episcleritis, is another ocular complication that can occur in Crohn's disease but it isn't as frequent as arthritis. Uveitis refers to inflammation of any part of the uveal tract which includes the iris, ciliary body and choroid.<br /><br />Lastly, <b>Clubbing</b> is not commonly associated with Crohn's disease.

        "correct_answer": "3",
        "question_notes": "The correct answer is <b>Arthritis</b>. Arthritis is the most common extra-intestinal manifestation of Crohn's disease, affecting up to 30% of patients. This can include both peripheral arthritis and axial arthritis (also known as spondyloarthropathy). The pathogenesis is not fully understood but it is thought to be due to an immune response triggered by the gastrointestinal inflammation.<br /><br /><b>Episcleritis</b> is an incorrect option. While episcleritis can occur in Crohn's disease, it is much less common than arthritis. Episcleritis involves inflammation of the episclera, a thin layer of tissue between the conjunctiva and the sclera of the eye. It typically presents with redness and mild pain in one or both eyes.<br /><br /><b>Erythema nodosum</b>, although being one of the cutaneous manifestations associated with Crohn's disease, it is not as common as arthritis. Erythema nodosum presents as painful, red nodules usually located on the shins. It represents a hypersensitivity reaction to various triggers including infections and drugs.<br /><br /><b>Uveitis</b>, like episcleritis, is another ocular complication that can occur in Crohn's disease but it isn't as frequent as arthritis. Uveitis refers to inflammation of any part of the uveal tract which includes the iris, ciliary body and choroid.<br /><br />Lastly, <b>Clubbing</b> is not commonly associated with Crohn's disease. Clubbing refers to changes in the physical appearance of fingernails or toenails that suggest certain systemic diseases such as lung cancer or heart disease. However, clubbing can sometimes be seen in severe malabsorption states which might occur in advanced cases of inflammatory bowel diseases like Crohn's but it would still be considered rare compared to other manifestations like arthritis.<br />",

            "The correct answer is <b>Parkinsonism</b>. This side effect of antipsychotic medication, such as chlorpromazine, is characterised by the presence of a resting tremor, bradykinesia (slowness of movement), rigidity and postural instability. These symptoms are due to the dopamine-blocking effects of these medications in the basal ganglia, which results in an imbalance between dopamine and acetylcholine activity. This mirrors the pathophysiology seen in Parkinson's disease itself, hence the term 'Parkinsonism'. <br /><br /><b>Tardive dyskinesia</b> is another potential side-effect of antipsychotic medication usage but it is not the correct answer in this case. Tardive dyskinesia refers to late-onset involuntary movements that typically affect the orofacial muscles leading to grimacing, tongue protrusion and lip-smacking behaviour. It can also affect limb and trunk muscles causing choreoathetoid movements.<br /><br /><b>Acute dystonia</b> is incorrect because it refers to sudden onset muscle spasms that can lead to abnormal postures. It is often painful and can occur within hours to days after starting an antipsychotic medication. In this case, our patient has a bilateral resting tremor rather than muscle spasms or abnormal postures.<br /><br /><b>Akathisia</b> is another possible side-effect of antipsychotics, however it doesn't match our scenario either. Akathisia presents as a subjective feeling of restlessness often accompanied by fidgeting movements or pacing around. It does not cause a resting tremor.<br /><br />Finally, <b>Neuroleptic malignant syndrome</b> is a serious but rare complication of antipsychotic use characterised by fever, altered mental status, autonomic dysfunction and generalised rigidity (lead-pipe rigidity).

            "<b>Anti-tissue transglutaminase antibody</b> is the correct answer. The clinical presentation and image are highly suggestive of dermatitis herpetiformis, which is an autoimmune blistering skin disorder strongly associated with coeliac disease. Dermatitis herpetiformis presents with intensely pruritic, symmetrical vesicular lesions typically on extensor surfaces such as the elbows, knees, and buttocks. Over 90% of patients with dermatitis herpetiformis have underlying gluten-sensitive enteropathy, even if they don't have gastrointestinal symptoms. Anti-tissue transglutaminase (tTG) antibodies are the most sensitive and specific serological markers for coeliac disease, with sensitivity and specificity both exceeding 90%. These IgA antibodies target the enzyme tissue transglutaminase, which is involved in the cross-linking of gluten peptides in the small intestine. The presence of these antibodies in a patient with characteristic skin lesions of dermatitis herpetiformis strongly supports the diagnosis and indicates the need for a gluten-free diet, which is the cornerstone of management alongside medications like dapsone for symptomatic relief.<br /><br /><b>Anti-nuclear antibody (ANA)</b> is incorrect in this context. While ANAs are important markers for autoimmune conditions, they are primarily associated with systemic lupus erythematosus, mixed connective tissue disease, Sj\u00f6gren's syndrome, and other connective tissue disorders. The cutaneous manifestations of these conditions typically include malar rash, discoid lesions, or photosensitivity rather than the vesicular eruptions seen in dermatitis herpetiformis. The distribution and morphology of the rash in this patient, with symmetrical vesicular lesions on extensor surfaces, are not characteristic of ANA-associated disorders. Furthermore, the intense pruritus described is highly characteristic of dermatitis herpetiformis rather than lupus or other ANA-positive conditions.<br /><br /><b>Anti-Jo-1 antibody</b> is incorrect for this clinical scenario. Anti-Jo-1 antibodies are associated with antisynthetase syndrome, which is a subset of inflammatory myopathies (primarily polymyositis and dermatomyositis). While dermatomyositis does have cutaneous manifestations, these typically include a heliotrope rash (purplish discoloration of the eyelids), Gottron's papules (erythematous, scaly papules over the knuckles), and a photosensitive rash on the face, neck, and upper trunk. The vesicular, intensely pruritic rash on extensor surfaces seen in this patient is not consistent with the cutaneous findings in antisynthetase syndrome. Additionally, patients with anti-Jo-1 antibodies usually present with muscle weakness, interstitial lung disease, and arthritis, which are not mentioned in this case.<br /><br /><b>Anti-neutrophil cytoplasmic antibody (ANCA)</b> is incorrect for this presentation. ANCA is associated with a group of vasculitic disorders, including granulomatosis with polyangiitis (formerly Wegener's granulomatosis), microscopic polyangiitis, and eosinophilic granulomatosis with polyangiitis (formerly Churg-Strauss syndrome). The cutaneous manifestations of ANCA-associated vasculitides typically include palpable purpura, nodules, ulcers, or livedo reticularis, rather than the vesicular eruptions seen in this patient. Additionally, ANCA-associated vasculitides often involve multiple organ systems, particularly the respiratory tract and kidneys, and systemic symptoms such as fever, weight loss, and fatigue are common. The localised, symmetrical vesicular rash on extensor surfaces in this patient is not consistent with an ANCA-associated vasculitis.<br /><br /><b>Anti-endomysial antibody</b> is incorrect as the most likely positive antibody in this case, although it would likely be positive. Anti-endomysial antibodies (EMA) are indeed associated with coeliac disease and dermatitis herpetiformis, similar to anti-tissue transglutaminase antibodies. However, anti-tTG antibodies have largely replaced anti-endomysial antibodies in clinical practice due to their higher sensitivity, specificity, and the fact that the testing is less labour-intensive and more standardised. Both antibodies target the same antigen (tissue transglutaminase), but anti-tTG testing is now considered the first-line serological test for coeliac disease according to UK guidelines. While a positive anti-endomysial antibody test would support the diagnosis of dermatitis herpetiformis, anti-tTG antibody testing is the preferred initial investigation in the diagnostic workup of suspected coeliac disease or dermatitis herpetiformis.",

            "<b>Empagliflozin</b> is the correct answer. NICE guidelines recommend that SGLT-2 inhibitors are commenced in addition to metformin as initial therapy for type 2 diabetes (T2DM) if the patient has established atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (CVD) or chronic heart failure. They should also be considered in patients over the age of 40 with a QRisk of 10% or greater, or those under 40 with one or more cardiovascular risk factors (such as smoking or hypertension). There is evidence that SGLT-2 inhibitors have a cardioprotective effect with the greatest benefit seen in those with CVD; studies also show reduced hospital admissions and mortality in patients with heart failure.<br /><br /><b>Gliclazide</b> is not the best answer as there is no evidence that this would have a beneficial effect on this patient's cardiac comorbidity, unlike SGLT-2 inhibitors. It is, however, one of the most effective drugs to lower Hba1c but can cause weight gain. Gliclazide may sometimes be used as 'rescue therapy' in patients with T2DM who are symptomatic with very poor glycaemic control; this is not the case in this particular scenario.<br /><br /><b>Insulin</b> is not required at this stage as there are many other medications available to optimise glycaemic control before insulin should be considered. Insulin may sometimes be used short-term as 'rescue therapy' in patients with T2DM who are symptomatic with very poor glycaemic control; this is not the case in this particular scenario.<br /><br /><b>Pioglitazone</b> is contraindicated in patients with heart failure as it can worsen fluid retention and oedema, therefore it would not be a suitable option for this patient. Pioglitazone is also associated with an increased risk of fractures. Its benefits include safety in renal impairment and a low risk of hypoglycaemia.<br /><br /><b>Sitagliptin</b> is not the best answer as there is no evidence that this would have a beneficial effect on the patient's cardiac comorbidity, unlike SGLT-2 inhibitors.

            "This patient is presenting with symptoms and signs consistent with scarlet fever.  She has a sore throat, fever, and vomiting alongside a 'strawberry' tongue (bright red and bumpy) and coarse 'sandpaper' rash.  She should be managed with 10 days of oral <b>penicillin V</b> and can return to school 24 hours after starting the antibiotics.  <br /><br /><b>Flucloxacillin</b> is the management for cellulitis and other skin infections which are likely caused by <i>Staphylococcal</i> or <i>Streptococcal</i> species.  Cellulitis presents with fever and an area of erythematous, oedematous skin usually with a skin break site for a point of entry for the bacteria.  The erythema should be marked out with a pen around its borders to assess for any tracking.  Flucloxacillin is not indicated in the management of scarlet fever.  <br /><br /><b>Supportive therapy (paracetamol and encourage fluid intake)</b> would be supportive if the patient was considered to have a simple viral upper respiratory tract infection, however, this patient is presenting with a rash and upper respiratory signs consistent with scarlet fever.  The rash should guide the student away from considering this to be a simple viral infection.  Children may develop viral exanthematous rashes, however, these are typically splotchy and red rather than like sandpaper.  <br /><br /><b>Topical hydrocortisone 1% cream</b> is used in the management of rashes, such as pityriasis rosea.  This condition presents with a bumpy, red rash of scaly patches and is typically in children who are older (from 10 years onwards).  This condition does not usually lead to systemic features of vomiting or fever.  Most patients will have a resolution of symptoms without any medication in 2 weeks. <br /><br /><b>Topical ketoconazole</b> is used in the management of athlete's foot and ringworm, it is used against fungal infections.  As scarlet fever is caused by Group A <i>Streptococcus</i> this is an inappropriate option.",

She was delivered at 32+6 weeks via Caesarean section due to a massive maternal haemorrhage.  She is reaching her developmental milestones.  She has no regular medications or allergies.  On examination, she has an erythematous tongue and throat with no purulent tonsilar discharge.  There is a coarse erythematous rash over the torso, arms, and legs which is confluent in the flexures.  <br /><br />Considering the likely diagnosis, what is the most appropriate management?",
        "correct_answer": "2",
        "question_notes": "This patient is presenting with symptoms and signs consistent with scarlet fever.  She has a sore throat, fever, and vomiting alongside a 'strawberry' tongue (bright red and bumpy) and coarse 'sandpaper' rash.  She should be managed with 10 days of oral <b>penicillin V</b> and can return to school 24 hours after starting the antibiotics.  <br /><br /><b>Flucloxacillin</b> is the management for cellulitis and other skin infections which are likely caused by <i>Staphylococcal</i> or <i>Streptococcal</i> species.  Cellulitis presents with fever and an area of erythematous, oedematous skin usually with a skin break site for a point of entry for the bacteria.  The erythema should be marked out with a pen around its borders to assess for any tracking.  Flucloxacillin is not indicated in the management of scarlet fever.  <br /><br /><b>Supportive therapy (paracetamol and encourage fluid intake)</b> would be supportive if the patient was considered to have a simple viral upper respiratory tract infection, however, this patient is presenting with a rash and upper respiratory signs consistent with scarlet fever.  The rash should guide the student away from considering this to be a simple viral infection.  Children may develop viral exanthematous rashes, however, these are typically splotchy and red rather than like sandpaper.  <br /><br /><b>Topical hydrocortisone 1% cream</b> is used in the management of rashes, such as pityriasis rosea.  This condition presents with a bumpy, red rash of scaly patches and is typically in children who are older (from 10 years onwards).  This condition does not usually lead to systemic features of vomiting or fever.  Most patients will have a resolution of symptoms without any medication in 2 weeks. <br /><br /><b>Topical ketoconazole</b> is used in the management of athlete's foot and ringworm, it is used against fungal infections.  As scarlet fever is caused by Group A <i>Streptococcus</i> this is an inappropriate option.",
