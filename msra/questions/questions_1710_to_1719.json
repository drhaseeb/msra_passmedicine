            "<b>Add high-dose oral mesalazine</b> is the correct answer. This patient has moderate ulcerative colitis (4-6 bloody stools daily without systemic upset) with extensive disease extending to the hepatic flexure. According to NICE guidelines, extensive disease should be treated with both topical (rectal) aminosalicylate and high-dose oral aminosalicylate from the outset. The key teaching point here is that rectal preparations (enemas and suppositories) have limited proximal reach, typically only reaching the splenic flexure at best. Since this patient's inflammation extends to the hepatic flexure (right side of colon), rectal mesalazine alone cannot adequately treat the proximal disease. After 10 days of rectal therapy with minimal improvement, the appropriate next step is to add high-dose oral aminosalicylate to ensure the entire affected area receives treatment. This combination approach addresses both the distal disease (via rectal route) and the more proximal extensive inflammation (via oral route).<br /><br /><b>Continue rectal mesalazine alone</b> is inappropriate because rectal preparations have limited proximal reach and cannot adequately treat disease extending to the hepatic flexure. The patient has already tried this approach for 10 days with minimal improvement, and continuing the same inadequate treatment would delay appropriate management and potentially allow disease progression.<br /><br /><b>Switch to rectal corticosteroid</b> is not the recommended next step according to NICE guidelines. For extensive disease, the priority is to add oral aminosalicylate to the rectal preparation rather than switching to a different rectal agent. Rectal corticosteroids would still face the same limitation of inadequate proximal reach and would not address the extensive nature of the inflammation.<br /><br /><b>Commence oral prednisolone</b> would be premature at this stage. Oral corticosteroids are reserved for patients who have not achieved remission after 4 weeks of combined topical and oral aminosalicylate therapy. This patient has only been on rectal mesalazine for 10 days and has not yet tried the appropriate combination therapy. Introducing corticosteroids prematurely exposes the patient to unnecessary side effects.<br /><br /><b>Arrange hospital admission for intravenous corticosteroids</b> is not indicated as this patient has moderate, not severe, ulcerative colitis. Severe colitis requiring hospital admission is defined by >6 bloody stools per day plus features of systemic upset such as fever, tachycardia, anaemia, or raised inflammatory markers.

        "body": "Priapism is a persistent penile erection, typically defined as lasting longer than 4 hours and is not associated with sexual stimulation.  Priapism can be described as either ischaemic or non-ischaemic with both categories having a different pathophysiology.  Ischaemic priapism is typically due to impaired vasorelaxation and therefore reduced vascular outflow resulting in congestion and trapping of de-oxygenated blood within the corpus cavernosa. Non-ischaemic priapism is due to high arterial inflow, typically due to fistula formation often either as the result of congenital or traumatic mechanisms.<br /><br />Epidemiology<br /><ul><li>Age at presentation has a bimodal distribution, with peaks between 5-10 years and 20-50 years of age</li><li>incidence has been estimated at up to 5.34 per 100,000 patient-years</li></ul><br />Causes<br /><ul><li>Idiopathic</li><li>Sickle cell disease or other haemoglobinopathies</li><li>Erectile dysfunction medication (e.g. Sildenafil and other PDE-5 inhibitors), this also includes intracavernosal injected therapies.</li><li>Other drugs both prescribed (anti-hypertensives, anticoagulants, antidepressants etc) and recreational (specifically cocaine, cannabis and ecstasy).</li><li>Trauma</li></ul><br />Patients typically present acutely with:<br /><ul><li>A persistent erection lasting over 4 hours</li><li>Pain localised to the penis</li><li>Often a history of either known haemoglobinopathy or use of medications listed above</li><li>Patients may, more rarely, present with either a non-painful erection or an erection that is not fully rigid: these are both suggestive of non-ischaemic priapism.</li><li>History of trauma to the genital or perineal region: also suggestive of non-ischaemic priapism.</li></ul><br /><br />Investigations:<br /><ul><li><span class=\"concept\" data-cid=\"9680\">Cavernosal blood gas analysis</span> to differentiate between ischaemic and non-ischaemic: <i>in ischaemic priapism pO2 and pH would be reduced whilst pCO2 would be increased.</i></li><li>Doppler or duplex ultrasonography: this can be used as an alternative to blood gas analysis to assess for blood flow within the penis.</li><li>A full blood count and toxicology screen can be used to assess for an underlying cause of the priapism.</li><li>Diagnosis of priapism is largely clinical, with investigations helping to categorise into ischaemic and non-ischaemic as well as assessing for the underlying cause.</li></ul><br /><h5 class='notes-heading'>Management</h5><br />Ischaemic priapism is a <span class=\"concept\" data-cid=\"9047\">medical emergency</span> and delayed treatment can lead to permanent tissue damage and long-term erectile dysfunction. <br /><ul><li>If the priapism has lasted longer than 4 hours, the first-line treatment is aspiration of blood from the cavernosa, this is often combined with injection of a saline flush to help clear viscous blood that has pooled.</li><li>If aspiration and injection fails, then <span class=\"concept\" data-cid=\"12382\">intracavernosal injection of a vasoconstrictive agent such as phenylephrine</span> is used and repeated at 5 minute intervals.</li><li>If medical therapy fails then surgical options can be considered.</li></ul><br />Non-ischaemic priapism is not a medical emergency and is normally suitable for observation as a first-line option.",

            "The correct answer is <b>Malted milk biscuits</b> because they contain milk protein that has been extensively heated during the baking process, which denatures and alters the allergenic proteins, making them less likely to trigger an allergic response. The milk ladder is a structured approach to gradually reintroducing milk protein into the diet of children with cow's milk protein allergy (CMPA), starting with foods containing the most processed forms of milk and progressing to less processed forms. Baked milk products are typically introduced first as they are better tolerated.<br /><br /><b>Cheese</b> is incorrect because it contains minimally processed milk proteins and is typically introduced much later in the milk ladder, usually around step 5 or 6. The proteins remain largely intact during cheese production, making it more likely to trigger an allergic reaction in sensitive individuals.<br /><br /><b>Chocolate</b> is incorrect as it contains milk proteins that are less processed than baked goods. While milk chocolate is included in the milk ladder, it appears later in the progression, typically around step 4, after tolerance to baked milk products has been established.<br /><br /><b>Shepherd's pie</b> is incorrect because although it contains cooked milk (in mashed potato), the heating process is less extensive than baking, and the milk proteins remain relatively intact. This type of food would be introduced later in the milk ladder progression.<br /><br /><b>Yoghurt</b> is incorrect as it contains minimally processed milk proteins and is one of the last foods to be introduced in the milk ladder, typically at step 12.

            "<b>Arrange urgent ophthalmology referral within 1 week</b> is the correct answer. This patient presents with features highly suggestive of age-related macular degeneration (AMD), specifically metamorphopsia (distorted central vision with wavy lines) affecting her ability to read. The subacute onset over 3 weeks, combined with her age and significant risk factors (smoking, hypertension), raises concern for wet AMD. Wet AMD is characterised by choroidal neovascularisation and can cause rapid visual loss. The key to management is early detection and treatment with anti-VEGF therapy, which should ideally be instituted within the first two months of diagnosis to stabilise or reverse visual loss. UK guidelines recommend urgent referral to ophthalmology within 1 week for suspected AMD to allow prompt assessment with slit-lamp microscopy, optical coherence tomography, and potentially fluorescein angiography. This timeframe ensures that if wet AMD is confirmed, anti-VEGF treatment can be initiated quickly to preserve vision. Any delay in referral could result in irreversible visual loss, making the 1-week urgent referral pathway essential for optimal outcomes.<br /><br /><b>Arrange routine ophthalmology referral within 6 months</b> is inappropriate as this timeframe is far too long for suspected AMD. The patient's symptoms of metamorphopsia and reduced visual acuity over 3 weeks suggest possible wet AMD, which requires urgent assessment. A 6-month wait would likely result in significant irreversible visual deterioration, particularly if neovascular changes are present. This delay would miss the critical window for anti-VEGF therapy, which is most effective when started within 2 months of diagnosis. Routine referrals of this duration are reserved for stable, non-urgent ophthalmic conditions where there is no risk of progressive visual loss.<br /><br /><b>Prescribe zinc with antioxidant vitamins and review in 3 months</b> is not appropriate as the initial management step. While the AREDS trial demonstrated that zinc combined with antioxidant vitamins (A, C, and E) can reduce progression of dry AMD by approximately one third, this treatment is recommended for patients with at least moderate category dry AMD who have already been assessed by ophthalmology. This patient requires urgent specialist assessment first to determine whether she has wet or dry AMD, as the management differs significantly. Prescribing supplements without confirming the diagnosis could delay crucial anti-VEGF treatment if wet AMD is present, potentially resulting in permanent visual loss.<br /><br /><b>Arrange urgent ophthalmology referral within 2 weeks</b> represents a common cancer referral pathway timeframe but is not sufficiently urgent for suspected AMD. While 2 weeks might seem reasonably prompt, UK guidelines specifically recommend a 1-week referral for suspected AMD to ensure timely diagnosis and treatment. The distinction is important because wet AMD can progress rapidly, and even a week's difference in initiating anti-VEGF therapy can impact visual outcomes. The 2-week pathway, while urgent, does not align with the specific guidance for AMD and could result in suboptimal management of this sight-threatening condition.<br /><br /><b>Arrange routine ophthalmology referral within 18 weeks</b> is completely inappropriate for this presentation. The 18-week referral-to-treatment standard is the maximum waiting time for routine NHS referrals and is unsuitable for any condition with potential for progressive visual loss. This patient's symptoms of metamorphopsia and reduced visual acuity over 3 weeks warrant urgent investigation for AMD, particularly wet AMD which can cause rapid, irreversible vision loss. Waiting 18 weeks would almost certainly result in significant visual deterioration and would miss the therapeutic window for effective anti-VEGF treatment, representing a serious failure in clinical management.",

Routine referrals of this duration are reserved for stable, non-urgent ophthalmic conditions where there is no risk of progressive visual loss.<br /><br /><b>Prescribe zinc with antioxidant vitamins and review in 3 months</b> is not appropriate as the initial management step. While the AREDS trial demonstrated that zinc combined with antioxidant vitamins (A, C, and E) can reduce progression of dry AMD by approximately one third, this treatment is recommended for patients with at least moderate category dry AMD who have already been assessed by ophthalmology. This patient requires urgent specialist assessment first to determine whether she has wet or dry AMD, as the management differs significantly. Prescribing supplements without confirming the diagnosis could delay crucial anti-VEGF treatment if wet AMD is present, potentially resulting in permanent visual loss.<br /><br /><b>Arrange urgent ophthalmology referral within 2 weeks</b> represents a common cancer referral pathway timeframe but is not sufficiently urgent for suspected AMD. While 2 weeks might seem reasonably prompt, UK guidelines specifically recommend a 1-week referral for suspected AMD to ensure timely diagnosis and treatment. The distinction is important because wet AMD can progress rapidly, and even a week's difference in initiating anti-VEGF therapy can impact visual outcomes. The 2-week pathway, while urgent, does not align with the specific guidance for AMD and could result in suboptimal management of this sight-threatening condition.<br /><br /><b>Arrange routine ophthalmology referral within 18 weeks</b> is completely inappropriate for this presentation. The 18-week referral-to-treatment standard is the maximum waiting time for routine NHS referrals and is unsuitable for any condition with potential for progressive visual loss. This patient's symptoms of metamorphopsia and reduced visual acuity over 3 weeks warrant urgent investigation for AMD, particularly wet AMD which can cause rapid, irreversible vision loss. Waiting 18 weeks would almost certainly result in significant visual deterioration and would miss the therapeutic window for effective anti-VEGF treatment, representing a serious failure in clinical management.",
