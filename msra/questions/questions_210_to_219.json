            "Tamoxifen is a selective oestrogen receptor modulator used to treat oestrogen-receptor positive breast cancer.

The most common of these is hot flushes which occur in more than 1 in 10 patients taking tamoxifen.<br /><br />Patients taking tamoxifen are at a greater risk of developing a deep vein thrombosis (DVT) during periods of immobility (such as after lower limb surgery) but DVT is not a side effect of tamoxifen in itself so this is incorrect. When counselling patients taking tamoxifen for major surgery, you should calculate their risk and consider stopping tamoxifen temporarily whilst recovering from the surgery to reduce the risk of thromboembolic disease. A personal or family history of unprovoked thromboembolism is a contraindication to starting tamoxifen treatment.<br /><br />Endometrial cancer is a known adverse effect of tamoxifen and the risk of developing endometrial cancer increases with time taking the drug. However, the overall risk of developing endometrial cancer is far lower than developing hot flushes so this is incorrect.<br /><br />Hair loss is a common side effect of systemic chemotherapy as hair follicles, being rapidly mitotic tissues, are very sensitive to cytotoxic drugs. However, as tamoxifen is not cytotoxic in itself, it rarely causes hair loss and is more likely to cause hair thinning (similar to that experienced during menopause).<br /><br />Tamoxifen can precipitate headaches, including migraines, though the frequency is lower than hot flushes so this is incorrect.",

            "<b>Acne rosacea</b> is the best fit for this patient because the clinical picture combines several cardinal features: episodic flushing precipitated by alcohol and emotional stress, fixed central facial erythema with telangiectasia, and later development of papules and pustules in the absence of comedones. These appearances, along with the typical anatomical distribution over the cheeks and nose, are classic for rosacea. Understanding that rosacea is a chronic inflammatory disorder of the pilosebaceous unit helps explain why antibiotics such as doxycycline improve the inflammatory component while measures such as topical brimonidine target vasodilatation. Recognising these hallmarks is essential in primary care to initiate appropriate topical therapy, advise on trigger avoidance and use of high-factor sunscreen.<br /><br /><b>Systemic lupus erythematosus</b> can present with a malar or \u2018butterfly\u2019 rash but it is usually macular, non-scarring and photosensitive, and crucially spares the nasolabial folds. Papules, pustules and telangiectasia are uncommon in acute cutaneous lupus. Moreover, the patient has no systemic features such as arthralgia or constitutional upset, making SLE less likely.<br /><br /><b>Acne vulgaris</b> typically shows open and closed comedones as the first lesions, followed by inflammatory papules, pustules and nodules. Comedones are notably absent in this scenario, and adult-onset inflammatory acne without comedones is unusual. In addition, flushing episodes are not characteristic of acne vulgaris.<br /><br /><b>Seborrhoeic dermatitis</b> affects seborrhoeic areas \u2013 scalp, eyebrows, nasolabial folds and retro-auricular skin \u2013 and manifests as greasy, yellowish, scaling erythema rather than discrete papules and pustules. Telangiectasia and flushing are not prominent features, so the description does not correspond with seborrhoeic dermatitis.<br /><br /><b>Perioral dermatitis</b> presents with clusters of tiny papulopustules around the mouth, occasionally the peri-ocular skin, and typically spares a clear rim next to the vermilion border. In this patient, the eruption is centred on the cheeks and nose with no perioral involvement, making this diagnosis improbable. Unlike rosacea, perioral dermatitis is often associated with the use of topical corticosteroids, which is not mentioned here.<br />",

        "question_notes": "<b>Acne rosacea</b> is the best fit for this patient because the clinical picture combines several cardinal features: episodic flushing precipitated by alcohol and emotional stress, fixed central facial erythema with telangiectasia, and later development of papules and pustules in the absence of comedones. These appearances, along with the typical anatomical distribution over the cheeks and nose, are classic for rosacea. Understanding that rosacea is a chronic inflammatory disorder of the pilosebaceous unit helps explain why antibiotics such as doxycycline improve the inflammatory component while measures such as topical brimonidine target vasodilatation. Recognising these hallmarks is essential in primary care to initiate appropriate topical therapy, advise on trigger avoidance and use of high-factor sunscreen.<br /><br /><b>Systemic lupus erythematosus</b> can present with a malar or \u2018butterfly\u2019 rash but it is usually macular, non-scarring and photosensitive, and crucially spares the nasolabial folds. Papules, pustules and telangiectasia are uncommon in acute cutaneous lupus. Moreover, the patient has no systemic features such as arthralgia or constitutional upset, making SLE less likely.<br /><br /><b>Acne vulgaris</b> typically shows open and closed comedones as the first lesions, followed by inflammatory papules, pustules and nodules. Comedones are notably absent in this scenario, and adult-onset inflammatory acne without comedones is unusual. In addition, flushing episodes are not characteristic of acne vulgaris.<br /><br /><b>Seborrhoeic dermatitis</b> affects seborrhoeic areas \u2013 scalp, eyebrows, nasolabial folds and retro-auricular skin \u2013 and manifests as greasy, yellowish, scaling erythema rather than discrete papules and pustules. Telangiectasia and flushing are not prominent features, so the description does not correspond with seborrhoeic dermatitis.<br /><br /><b>Perioral dermatitis</b> presents with clusters of tiny papulopustules around the mouth, occasionally the peri-ocular skin, and typically spares a clear rim next to the vermilion border. In this patient, the eruption is centred on the cheeks and nose with no perioral involvement, making this diagnosis improbable. Unlike rosacea, perioral dermatitis is often associated with the use of topical corticosteroids, which is not mentioned here.<br />",

            "The correct answer is Sweet's syndrome, as this condition is not typically associated with diabetes mellitus. Sweet's syndrome, also known as acute febrile neutrophilic dermatosis, is characterised by tender, erythematous plaques and nodules, often accompanied by fever and neutrophilia. It is commonly associated with malignancy (particularly haematological), inflammatory bowel disease, or medications, but not with diabetes mellitus.<br /><br /><b>Necrobiosis lipoidica</b> is incorrect because it is a well-established cutaneous manifestation of diabetes mellitus, occurring in approximately 0.3-1.2% of diabetic patients. It presents as yellow-brown atrophic plaques with telangiectasia, typically on the anterior shin, and can ulcerate.<br /><br /><b>Granuloma annulare</b> is incorrect as it has a known association with diabetes mellitus, particularly in its generalised form. It presents as flesh-coloured to erythematous annular plaques and is more common in diabetic patients than in the general population.<br /><br /><b>Vitiligo</b> is incorrect because it has a recognised association with diabetes mellitus, particularly type 1 diabetes, as part of autoimmune polyglandular syndrome. It presents as well-demarcated areas of depigmentation due to destruction of melanocytes.<br /><br /><b>Lipoatrophy</b> is incorrect as it is a recognised complication of diabetes mellitus, particularly in patients using insulin. It presents as localised loss of subcutaneous fat at insulin injection sites and can significantly impact insulin absorption and glycaemic control.",

        "question_notes": "The correct answer is Sweet's syndrome, as this condition is not typically associated with diabetes mellitus. Sweet's syndrome, also known as acute febrile neutrophilic dermatosis, is characterised by tender, erythematous plaques and nodules, often accompanied by fever and neutrophilia. It is commonly associated with malignancy (particularly haematological), inflammatory bowel disease, or medications, but not with diabetes mellitus.<br /><br /><b>Necrobiosis lipoidica</b> is incorrect because it is a well-established cutaneous manifestation of diabetes mellitus, occurring in approximately 0.3-1.2% of diabetic patients. It presents as yellow-brown atrophic plaques with telangiectasia, typically on the anterior shin, and can ulcerate.<br /><br /><b>Granuloma annulare</b> is incorrect as it has a known association with diabetes mellitus, particularly in its generalised form. It presents as flesh-coloured to erythematous annular plaques and is more common in diabetic patients than in the general population.<br /><br /><b>Vitiligo</b> is incorrect because it has a recognised association with diabetes mellitus, particularly type 1 diabetes, as part of autoimmune polyglandular syndrome. It presents as well-demarcated areas of depigmentation due to destruction of melanocytes.<br /><br /><b>Lipoatrophy</b> is incorrect as it is a recognised complication of diabetes mellitus, particularly in patients using insulin. It presents as localised loss of subcutaneous fat at insulin injection sites and can significantly impact insulin absorption and glycaemic control.",

            "This patient has a confirmed ectopic pregnancy with a visible foetal heartbeat on ultrasound. According to NICE guideline CG154, the presence of a foetal heartbeat is an absolute indication for surgical management, as it signifies a more advanced ectopic pregnancy with a higher risk of tubal rupture. Medical management with methotrexate is less likely to be successful in this scenario. The patient is haemodynamically stable, so laparoscopic surgery is appropriate. <b>Laparoscopic salpingectomy</b>, the removal of the affected fallopian tube, is the recommended first-line surgical procedure for ectopic pregnancy in women without other risk factors for infertility (such as contralateral tube damage). The question does not mention any such risk factors, making salpingectomy the most appropriate choice. It offers a definitive cure with a lower risk of persistent trophoblastic disease compared to salpingotomy.<br /><br /><b>Expectant management</b> is only suitable for a select group of women who are asymptomatic, have an ectopic pregnancy measuring less than 35mm, no foetal heartbeat, and a serum \u03b2-hCG level below 1,000 IU/L. This patient is symptomatic with pain, has a foetal heartbeat, and her \u03b2-hCG is 2500 IU/L, making expectant management entirely inappropriate and unsafe due to the high risk of rupture.<br /><br /><b>Intramuscular methotrexate</b> is a viable option for some ectopic pregnancies, but it is contraindicated in this case. The criteria for medical management include an unruptured ectopic pregnancy less than 35mm, no significant pain, and crucially, no visible foetal heartbeat. The presence of a foetal heartbeat indicates a more developed pregnancy that is less likely to respond to methotrexate, thereby increasing the risk of treatment failure and subsequent tubal rupture. Although her \u03b2-hCG level (<5000 IU/L) and the size of the mass (<35mm) would otherwise be consistent with medical management, the foetal heartbeat overrides these factors.<br /><br /><b>Laparoscopic salpingotomy</b> involves making an incision in the fallopian tube to remove the ectopic pregnancy while preserving the tube. This is considered a second-line surgical option. NICE guidelines recommend considering salpingotomy for women who have risk factors for infertility, such as pre-existing damage to the contralateral tube, as it preserves potential future fertility. As no such risk factors are mentioned in the scenario, the standard and most definitive treatment is salpingectomy. Salpingotomy also carries a 15-20% risk of persistent trophoblastic tissue, which may require further treatment with methotrexate or a subsequent salpingectomy.<br /><br /><b>Repeat \u03b2-hCG in 48 hours</b> is a monitoring tool, not a definitive management plan. It is used in expectant management or when the location of the pregnancy is uncertain (a 'pregnancy of unknown location'). In this case, a definitive diagnosis of a live ectopic pregnancy has been made via ultrasound. Delaying definitive surgical treatment for 48 hours would place the patient at an unnecessary and significant risk of life-threatening tubal rupture and haemorrhage.",

Salpingotomy also carries a 15-20% risk of persistent trophoblastic tissue, which may require further treatment with methotrexate or a subsequent salpingectomy.<br /><br /><b>Repeat \u03b2-hCG in 48 hours</b> is a monitoring tool, not a definitive management plan. It is used in expectant management or when the location of the pregnancy is uncertain (a 'pregnancy of unknown location'). In this case, a definitive diagnosis of a live ectopic pregnancy has been made via ultrasound. Delaying definitive surgical treatment for 48 hours would place the patient at an unnecessary and significant risk of life-threatening tubal rupture and haemorrhage.",
