            "Untreated glue ear can lead to speech and language problems or behavioural problems in children. It should always be considered in otherwise healthy children who present with delays in speech and language development. Children may often be referred to as being naughty because they are unable to hear instructions. Glue ear can self-resolve however given that it occurs during a time in which children are developing their language skills and can affect hearing, treatment is often given to reduce the impact of symptoms on development. Children suspected of having glue ear should be referred to a specialist for consideration of grommet insertion<br /><br />Cerebral palsy, learning disability and autism can also all lead to problems with speech and language development however given the rest of the history are less likely. <br /><br />Whilst all children develop at different paces if a potential delay in development has been raised by the school this should be taken seriously and organic causes ruled out. By this age, most children should be able to talk in sentences and be understood by an adult. The past medical history of ear infections also points towards a diagnosis of glue ear.",

He is often badly behaved in class ignoring instructions.  He had no complications around pregnancy or birth and has normal motor skills for his age. He has no prior medical history other than tonsillitis and a couple of ear infections as a toddler. <br /><br />Which is the most likely diagnosis?",

        "question_notes": "Untreated glue ear can lead to speech and language problems or behavioural problems in children. It should always be considered in otherwise healthy children who present with delays in speech and language development. Children may often be referred to as being naughty because they are unable to hear instructions. Glue ear can self-resolve however given that it occurs during a time in which children are developing their language skills and can affect hearing, treatment is often given to reduce the impact of symptoms on development. Children suspected of having glue ear should be referred to a specialist for consideration of grommet insertion<br /><br />Cerebral palsy, learning disability and autism can also all lead to problems with speech and language development however given the rest of the history are less likely. <br /><br />Whilst all children develop at different paces if a potential delay in development has been raised by the school this should be taken seriously and organic causes ruled out. By this age, most children should be able to talk in sentences and be understood by an adult. The past medical history of ear infections also points towards a diagnosis of glue ear.",

Initial management of COPD with asthmatic features is with an inhaled short-acting beta-agonist (SABA), which he is already prescribed.
