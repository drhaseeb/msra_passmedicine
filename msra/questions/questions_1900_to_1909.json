            "<b>First degree heart block</b> is the correct answer. This image shows an ECG with an abnormally long PR interval. The PR interval should be between 3 and 5 small squares on the ECG (as each square is equivalent to 0.04 seconds the range is 0.12-0.20 seconds). It represents the time needed for the electrical conduction to reach the atrioventricular (AV) node from the sino-atrial (SA) node. In this case, this is prolonged, alluding to a potential heart block. As the PR is constantly prolonged and there are no dropped beats, this is most likely to be a first-degree heart block. The left axis deviation present is most likely to be a normal variant. This patient might need to be investigated with an exercise ECG to assess the changes in their PR interval.<br /><br /><b>Left bundle branch block</b> is incorrect. This would produce changes in leads V1-V6. Most characteristically, there would be a prominent S wave in V1 and a prominent double R wave in V6. This can be easily remembered by the mnemonic WiLLiaM, where the letter W is what the V1 lead will look like, the letter M is what the lead V6 will look like and the L is for the left bundle branch block.<br /><br /><b>Mobitz type 2 heart block</b> is incorrect. A Mobitz type 2 heart block would present with a contact PR interval but with random 'dropped beats'. This is because the atrioventricular connection is disrupted suddenly at times causing a lack of QRS complex following a P wave. <br /><br /><b>Third degree heart block</b> is incorrect. If there was a third-degree heart block the QRS complexes would appear at a rate of approximately 30bpm, which would not be associated with the P waves. In other words, the atria and ventricles would be contracting in an unrelated to each other fashion.<br /><br /><b>Wenckebach heart block</b> is incorrect. This is also known as Mobitz type 1, which would present as prolonged PR intervals that gradually become more and more prolonged until a dropped beat happens. This means a QRS complex will be missing after a few gradually prolonged PR intervals. This is not the case here.",
