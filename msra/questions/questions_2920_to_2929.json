            "The correct answer to this question is '<b>Seminomas have a better prognosis than teratomas</b>'. This is because seminomas are a type of germ cell tumour that are generally more sensitive to radiation and chemotherapy compared to non-seminomatous germ cell tumours such as teratomas. Seminomas also tend to be less aggressive and spread more slowly than non-seminomatous germ cell tumours, leading to a better overall prognosis.<br /><br />Now let's discuss the incorrect options:<br /><br />'<b>Fragile X syndrome is a risk factor</b>' - Fragile X syndrome, an inherited condition causing intellectual disability, is not known to be associated with an increased risk of testicular cancer. The primary health concerns related to Fragile X syndrome include learning disabilities and cognitive impairment.<br /><br />'<b>Gynaecomastia is seen in the majority of men</b>' - While gynaecomastia can occur in some cases of testicular cancer due to hormonal changes caused by the tumour, it is not seen in the majority of men with this condition. Gynaecomastia may be present if the testicular cancer produces high levels of hormones that stimulate breast growth but this isn't common.<br /><br />'<b>Afro-Caribbean ethnicity is a risk factor</b>' - Testicular cancer actually has a lower incidence rate among individuals of Afro-Caribbean descent compared to those from Northern European backgrounds. Therefore, being of Afro-Caribbean ethnicity would not increase one's risk of developing testicular cancer.<br /><br />'<b>May present as a varicocele in up to 10% of patients</b>' - A varicocele refers to an enlargement of the veins within the scrotum, similar to a varicose vein you might see in your leg. While it can cause symptoms similar to those seen in testicular cancer (such as swelling or lumps), it is typically benign and does not lead directly lead to testicular cancer. It's also worth noting that while varicoceles are quite common (affecting about 15% of all men), they are rarely associated with testicular cancer.<br />",

            "<b>Check lithium level in 1 week</b> is correct. Following a dose change, lithium levels should be monitored weekly until stable. Although this patient had a level checked 5 days after the dose increase showing a therapeutic level of 0.7 mmol/L, this does not confirm stability. The narrow therapeutic range (0.4-1.0 mmol/L) and long half-life of lithium mean that steady-state concentrations may not yet be achieved. NICE and NPSA guidance emphasises the importance of weekly monitoring after dose changes to prevent both subtherapeutic dosing (risking relapse) and toxicity. The patient requires another level in approximately one week (making it roughly 12 days post-dose change) and this pattern should continue weekly until two consecutive stable levels are demonstrated. Only then can monitoring frequency be reduced to the standard three-monthly schedule for established patients.<br /><br /><b>Check lithium level in 3 months</b> is incorrect. Three-monthly monitoring is appropriate for patients on stable, established doses of lithium. However, this patient has recently had a dose increase, which necessitates more frequent monitoring. Waiting three months could risk either inadequate treatment if the level drops or toxicity if the level rises, particularly as steady-state may not yet be achieved. The three-month interval only applies once stability has been confirmed through consecutive weekly measurements.<br /><br /><b>Check lithium level in 6 months</b> is incorrect. Six-monthly monitoring relates to thyroid and renal function checks in patients on established lithium therapy, not to lithium level monitoring. This frequency is far too infrequent following a dose change and would expose the patient to significant risk. Lithium levels require much more frequent monitoring, particularly after dose adjustments, given the drug's narrow therapeutic window and potential for serious toxicity.<br /><br /><b>Check thyroid and renal function now</b> is incorrect. While thyroid and renal monitoring are important components of lithium surveillance, they are performed six-monthly in stable patients. There is no indication in this scenario that the patient has developed symptoms suggestive of thyroid dysfunction or renal impairment. The immediate priority following a dose change is to ensure the lithium level remains therapeutic and non-toxic through weekly level monitoring. Thyroid and renal function would be checked at their scheduled six-monthly intervals.<br /><br /><b>Check lithium level in 2 weeks</b> is incorrect. While this option recognises the need for ongoing monitoring after a dose change, the interval is too long. Guidelines specifically recommend weekly monitoring until levels are stable. Checking in two weeks rather than one week could miss an important trend towards toxicity or subtherapeutic levels. The weekly frequency allows for timely dose adjustments if needed and ensures patient safety during this higher-risk period following dose modification.",

            "The correct answer is <b>Livedo reticularis</b>, which is a reticular, mottled, purplish discolouration of the skin that occurs due to impaired blood flow in the cutaneous vessels. In antiphospholipid syndrome (APS), the presence of antiphospholipid antibodies leads to a hypercoagulable state, causing thrombosis in small blood vessels. This vascular compromise manifests as livedo reticularis, particularly on the legs, arms, and trunk. The pattern is often described as resembling a fishnet or lace-like appearance and may become more prominent with cold exposure. Livedo reticularis is considered one of the characteristic cutaneous manifestations of APS and can be an early clinical sign of the syndrome.<br /><br /><b>Lichen sclerosis</b> is an inflammatory condition characterised by white, atrophic plaques primarily affecting the anogenital region. While it can be associated with autoimmune conditions, it is not specifically linked to antiphospholipid syndrome. It is more commonly associated with autoimmune thyroid disease and vitiligo.<br /><br /><b>Lichen planus</b> is an inflammatory condition affecting the skin and mucous membranes, characterised by purple, polygonal, pruritic papules. While it is an autoimmune condition, it is not specifically associated with antiphospholipid syndrome. It is more commonly linked to hepatitis C infection and certain medications.<br /><br /><b>Lupus vulgaris</b> is a chronic form of cutaneous tuberculosis caused by <i>Mycobacterium tuberculosis</i>. It typically presents as reddish-brown plaques with a gelatinous consistency, most commonly on the face. It has no association with antiphospholipid syndrome and is instead related to tuberculosis infection.<br /><br /><b>Psoriasis</b> is a chronic inflammatory condition characterised by well-demarcated, erythematous plaques with silvery scale. While it can be associated with other autoimmune conditions, it does not have a specific association with antiphospholipid syndrome.

It entails the inability to deliver the body of the fetus using gentle traction, the head having already been delivered.
