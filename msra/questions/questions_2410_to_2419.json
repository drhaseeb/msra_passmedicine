            "The correct answer is <b>Venous thromboembolism</b>. Intravenous drug use, particularly heroin, is known to significantly increase the risk of venous thromboembolism (VTE). This is due to a combination of factors including direct damage to the vein wall from repeated injections leading to endothelial injury and inflammation, as well as the potential for contamination with bacterial pathogens leading to localised infection and sepsis. Both of these can promote a pro-thrombotic state resulting in VTE.<br /><br /><b>Seizures</b> are not typically a direct complication of intravenous heroin use. However, they can occur secondary to withdrawal in dependent users or due to complications such as hypoxia from overdose or infections like meningitis or encephalitis. It's also worth noting that adulterants mixed with street drugs may potentially cause seizures.<br /><br /><b>Osteoporosis</b> is not directly associated with intravenous drug use. However, lifestyle factors common in people who misuse substances - such as poor nutrition, smoking and alcohol abuse - can contribute towards bone loss over time. In addition, some studies suggest chronic opiate use might impact bone health but this relationship isn't fully understood.<br /><br /><b>Peptic ulcer disease</b> isn't directly linked with intravenous drug use either.

Furthermore, non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) which are commonly used by individuals for self-medication could contribute towards peptic ulcer disease.<br /><br />Finally, <b>Schizophrenia</b> isn't caused by heroin use. While substance misuse is common among individuals with schizophrenia, it's usually a way of self-medicating symptoms rather than a causative factor.

This partial activation is enough to alleviate cravings and withdrawal symptoms in individuals with opioid dependence. Furthermore, the binding of buprenorphine to the mu-opioid receptor is very strong, or 'high affinity,' meaning it can displace other opioids from these receptors and prevent them from exerting their effects. As a kappa-opioid receptor antagonist, buprenorphine may contribute to its ability to reduce symptoms of opioid withdrawal and potentially reduce depressive and dysphoric states.</li></ul></li><li>compliance is monitored using urinalysis</li><li>detoxification should normally last up to 4 weeks in an inpatient/residential setting and up to 12 weeks in the community</li></ul>",

A rhythm control approach would be reasonable for a patient with no medical history.

After this period of treatment, electrical cardioversion would be safe.<br /><br /><b>Commence apixaban and perform immediate electrical cardioversion</b> is incorrect. This woman is haemodynamically stable, meaning immediate cardioversion is not indicated. It risks systemic embolisation of thrombi that may have formed in the left atrial appendage.

This woman is cardiovascularly stable, meaning there is no need for emergency treatment. If she were very unwell, a transoesophageal echocardiogram would be useful for assessing left atrial appendage thrombus before electrical cardioversion.

Amiodarone would not be the agent of choice to alleviate her symptoms during the period whilst awaiting cardioversion. Amiodarone has many side effects and has a long half-life, meaning it takes many weeks to clear from the body. Certainly, amiodarone can be used for chemical cardioversion, but in this patient, this medication alongside electrical cardioversion is not recommended practice. Amiodarone is generally reserved for patients with refractory disease and those with structural heart disease. <br /><br /><b>Discharge on apixaban, bisoprolol, digoxin, and arrange cardioversion in two weeks</b> is incorrect.

        "title": "Abdominal stomas",
        "body": "Stomas may be sited during a range of abdominal procedures and involve bringing the lumen or visceral contents onto the skin. In most cases, this applies to the bowel. However, other organs or their contents may be diverted in case of need. <br /><br />With bowel stomas, the type method of construction and to a lesser extent the site will be determined by the contents of the bowel. In practice, small bowel stomas should be spouted so that their irritant contents are not in contact with the skin. Colonic stomas do not need to be spouted as their contents are less irritant. <br /><br />In the ideal situation, the site of the stoma should be marked with the patient prior to surgery. Stoma siting is important as it will ultimately influence the ability of the patient to manage their stoma and also reduce the risk of leakage. Leakage of stoma contents and subsequent maceration of the surrounding skin can rapidly progress into a spiralling loss of control of stoma contents. <br /><br /><h5 class='notes-heading'>Types of stomas</h5><br />Rule of thumb:<br /><br /><div class=\"table-responsive\"><table class = \"tlarge table table-striped table-bordered\"  data-role=\"table\" id=\"tableid1\" ><thead><tr><th></th><th><span class=\"concept\" data-cid=\"5484\">Ileostomy</span></th><th><span class=\"concept\" data-cid=\"11358\">Colostomy</span></th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td><b>Location</b></td><td>Right iliac fossa</td><td>Varies, more likely on the left side of the abdomen</td></tr><tr><td><b>Appearance</b></td><td>Spouted</td><td>Flushed</td></tr><tr><td><b>Output</b></td><td>Liquid</td><td>Solid</td></tr></tbody></table></div><br />More detail:<br /><br /><div class=\"table-responsive\"><table class = \"tlarge table table-striped table-bordered\"  data-role=\"table\" id=\"tableid2\" ><thead><tr><th><b>Name of stoma</b></th><th><b>Use</b></th><th><b>Common sites</b></th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Gastrostomy</td><td><ul><li>Gastric decompression or fixation</li><li>Feeding</td><td>Epigastrium</td></tr><tr><td></li></ul>Loop jejunostomy</td><td><ul><li>Seldom used as very high output</li><li>May be used following emergency laparotomy with planned early closure</td><td>Any location according to need</td></tr><tr><td></li></ul>Percutaneous jejunostomy</td><td><ul><li>Usually performed for feeding purposes and site in the proximal bowel</td><td>Usually left upper quadrant</td></tr><tr><td></li></ul><span class=\"concept\" data-cid=\"2264\">Loop ileostomy</span></td><td><ul><li>Defunctioning of colon e.g. following rectal cancer surgery</li><li>Does not decompress colon (if ileocaecal valve competent)</td><td>Usually right iliac fossa</td></tr><tr><td></li></ul>End ilestomy</td><td><ul><li>Usually following complete excision of colon or where ileocolic anastomosis is not planned</li><li>May be used to defunction colon, but reversal is more difficult</td><td>Usually right iliac fossa</td></tr><tr><td></li></ul>End colostomy</td><td>Where a colon is diverted or resected and anastomosis is not primarily achievable or desirable</td><td>Either left or right iliac fossa<br />&nbsp;</td></tr><tr><td><span class=\"concept\" data-cid=\"2263\">Loop colostomy</span></td><td><ul><li>To defunction a distal segment of colon</li><li>Since both lumens are present the distal lumen acts as a vent</td><td>May be located in any region of the abdomen, depending upon colonic segment used</td></tr><tr><td></li></ul>Caecostomy</td><td>Stoma of last resort where loop colostomy is not possible</td><td>Right iliac fossa</td></tr><tr><td>Mucous fistula</td><td><ul><li>To decompress a distal segment of bowel following colonic division or resection</li><li>Where closure of a distal resection margin is not safe or achievable</td><td>May be located in any region of the abdomen according to clinical need</td></tr></tbody></table></div></li></ul><br /><h5 class='notes-heading'>Complications</h5><br />Early complications (days post-op)<br /><ul><li>Bleeding</li><li>Ischaemia/necrosis \u2013 dusky, black stoma (urgent)</li><li><span class=\"concept\" data-cid=\"12438\">Retraction</span> \u2013 stoma sits below skin surface \u2192 leakage, skin irritation</li><li>Peristomal skin irritation \u2013 effluent contact</li><li>High-output stoma (ileostomies) \u2192 dehydration, electrolyte loss</li><li>Infection \u2013 wound or peristomal abscess</li></ul><br />Late complications (weeks\u2013years)<br /><ul><li>Parastomal hernia \u2013 most common long-term</li><li>Stenosis/stricture \u2013 poor effluent flow, obstruction</li><li>Prolapse \u2013 bowel telescopes through stoma</li><li>Chronic retraction \u2013 persistent, hard to fit appliances</li><li>Fistula formation</li><li>Psychological issues \u2013 body image, odour, social impact</li></ul><br />Key points of stoma complications<br /><ul><li>Colostomy: prone to prolapse and hernia</li><li>Ileostomy: risk of high output, electrolyte imbalance</li><li>Urostomy: skin irritation from alkaline urine</li><li>Management: stoma nurse support, appliance fitting, skin care; surgery if severe</li></ul>",
