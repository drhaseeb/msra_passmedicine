            "<b>Abdominal ultrasound scan</b> is the correct answer. This is the recommended first-line imaging modality for children with suspected appendicitis according to UK guidelines, including those from NICE. The clinical presentation, with migrating pain to the right iliac fossa and localised guarding, is highly suggestive of appendicitis. However, the diagnosis is not certain, and other conditions like mesenteric adenitis can present similarly in children. Ultrasound is a non-invasive investigation that avoids exposing the child to ionising radiation, which is a key consideration due to the increased lifetime risk of malignancy. It has good diagnostic accuracy in the paediatric population for identifying an inflamed, non-compressible appendix. It can also help identify alternative diagnoses, such as enlarged mesenteric lymph nodes or, in girls, ovarian pathology. Given the clinical suspicion in this 9-year-old boy, an ultrasound is the most appropriate next step to confirm the diagnosis and guide further management.<br /><br /><b>Abdominal X-ray</b> is an incorrect choice. It has a very limited role in the diagnosis of uncomplicated appendicitis. Its sensitivity and specificity are low. While it may occasionally reveal a radio-opaque appendicolith (a calcified faecolith in the appendix), this is only present in a minority of cases. It can be useful for identifying free air under the diaphragm in cases of perforation or signs of bowel obstruction, but it cannot be used to confirm or exclude appendicitis itself. A normal abdominal X-ray is common in appendicitis and does not rule out the diagnosis, making it an inappropriate primary investigation.<br /><br /><b>CT abdomen and pelvis</b> is incorrect in this context. Although CT scanning has high sensitivity and specificity for appendicitis and is often the investigation of choice in adults where the diagnosis is unclear, it is not the first-line investigation in children. The primary reason is the significant dose of ionising radiation associated with the scan. The ALARA (As Low As Reasonably Achievable) principle is paramount in paediatric imaging to minimise the lifetime risk of radiation-induced malignancy. CT is typically reserved for children only when the ultrasound scan is equivocal or non-diagnostic and there is still a strong clinical suspicion of appendicitis or a complication.<br /><br /><b>Diagnostic laparoscopy</b> is an incorrect choice at this stage. This is an invasive surgical procedure that requires a general anaesthetic. While it can be both diagnostic and therapeutic (allowing for an appendicectomy if appendicitis is confirmed), it is not the initial investigation. Non-invasive imaging should be performed first to confirm the diagnosis whenever possible. Proceeding directly to surgery without imaging confirmation is generally reserved for patients with unequivocal signs of peritonitis or when imaging is unavailable or inconclusive but clinical suspicion remains very high. In this case, a less invasive diagnostic step is more appropriate.<br /><br /><b>MRI abdomen and pelvis</b> is an incorrect choice. While MRI avoids ionising radiation and has high diagnostic accuracy, it is not the standard first-line investigation for suspected appendicitis in children. The reasons for this include its higher cost, longer acquisition time, and limited availability, especially out-of-hours, compared to ultrasound. The child would also need to remain still for a prolonged period, which can be challenging and may require sedation. MRI is typically used as a second-line imaging tool in specific situations, such as in pregnant patients or if ultrasound is inconclusive and a CT scan is to be avoided.",

            "The correct answer is <b><i>Trichomonas vaginalis</i></b>. This protozoan infection typically presents with a green, frothy, and malodorous vaginal discharge, accompanied by vulvar itching and dyspareunia (pain during sexual intercourse). The symptoms described by the patient align very closely with this diagnosis. <br /><br /><b><i>Candida</i></b> infection, also known as thrush, usually presents with a thick white 'cottage cheese-like' discharge rather than a green one. Itching is common but the discharge is not typically offensive smelling. It's also unlikely to cause pain during sex.<br /><br /><b>Bacterial vaginosis</b> can cause an offensive smell and discharge but it's more often grey-white rather than green. Furthermore, it doesn't typically cause vulval itching or pain during sex.<br /><br /><b>Gonorrhoea</b> can present with a purulent vaginal discharge which may be mistaken for a greenish colour at times. However, many women are asymptomatic or only have mild symptoms that might be mistaken for bladder or vaginal infections. In symptomatic cases, lower abdominal discomfort and abnormal menstruation are more common presentations.<br /><br />Lastly, <b><i>Chlamydia</i></b>, like gonorrhoea, often presents asymptomatically in women. When symptoms do occur they may include abnormal vaginal discharge (which isn't usually described as green) and pelvic pain but not usually vulval itching.<br />   <br />In conclusion, while all these conditions could potentially cause some of the symptoms described by the patient, the combination of an itchy vulva, pain during sex and a green offensive vaginal discharge makes <i>Trichomonas vaginalis</i> the most likely diagnosis according to UK guidelines.",

However, since starting a stressful job 6 months ago, she has had 1-2 migraines each week, requiring aspirin use and time off work.<br /><br />The patient has no other past medical history and no allergies.

            "<b>Propranolol</b> is an appropriate management option. The criteria NICE recommend for considering preventative treatment for migraines include frequent migraines (e.g. more than one per week) and migraines that are affecting quality of life and daily functioning. Both apply to this woman. Of the options listed, both propranolol and topiramate are first-line for migraine prevention. As topiramate is teratogenic and can reduce the efficacy of hormonal contraception, propranolol is recommended as the first-line preventative treatment for women of childbearing age. Although not listed, amitriptyline is another agent used for migraine prophylaxis, although its use may be limited by its side effects. <br /><br /><b>Stopping all analgesia</b> would be appropriate if medication-overuse headaches were suspected. Medication-overuse headaches occur 15 or more days per month in a person with a pre-existing primary headache disorder due to regular overuse of analgesia. Overuse is defined as the use of triptans or opioids on 10 or more days per month or the use of simple analgesia (including aspirin) on 15 or more days per month.

        "question": "A 24-year-old woman seeks advice from her GP due to migraine headaches that were diagnosed 5 years ago. These cause severe unilateral throbbing pain associated with vomiting. The only thing that helps these headaches is to take aspirin and lie in a darkened room for several hours. <br /><br />The patient previously had 1 headache a month. However, since starting a stressful job 6 months ago, she has had 1-2 migraines each week, requiring aspirin use and time off work.<br /><br />The patient has no other past medical history and no allergies. Her only other medication is the progestogen pill.<br /><br />What is the appropriate management?",
        "correct_answer": "2",
        "question_notes": "<b>Propranolol</b> is an appropriate management option. The criteria NICE recommend for considering preventative treatment for migraines include frequent migraines (e.g. more than one per week) and migraines that are affecting quality of life and daily functioning. Both apply to this woman. Of the options listed, both propranolol and topiramate are first-line for migraine prevention. As topiramate is teratogenic and can reduce the efficacy of hormonal contraception, propranolol is recommended as the first-line preventative treatment for women of childbearing age. Although not listed, amitriptyline is another agent used for migraine prophylaxis, although its use may be limited by its side effects. <br /><br /><b>Stopping all analgesia</b> would be appropriate if medication-overuse headaches were suspected. Medication-overuse headaches occur 15 or more days per month in a person with a pre-existing primary headache disorder due to regular overuse of analgesia. Overuse is defined as the use of triptans or opioids on 10 or more days per month or the use of simple analgesia (including aspirin) on 15 or more days per month. Neither the frequency of headache nor the frequency of aspirin use fits the criteria for medication-overuse headache.

            "<b>Chorioamnionitis</b> is the most likely diagnosis. This condition refers to an infection of the chorion, amnion, and amniotic fluid, which is an obstetric emergency due to the high risk of maternal and neonatal sepsis. The patient's history of preterm premature rupture of membranes (PPROM) is the single most important risk factor. The rupture of the membranes compromises the sterile environment of the uterus, allowing vaginal flora to ascend and cause infection. The clinical presentation in the stem is classic for chorioamnionitis, including the triad of fever (39\u00b0C), maternal signs of systemic illness ('flu-like symptoms'), and uterine-specific signs such as abdominal pain and contractions. The finding of a foul-smelling discharge from the cervix is highly suggestive of an intra-amniotic infection. According to UK guidelines (e.g., RCOG), a clinical diagnosis is made based on these features, and management should be initiated urgently with broad-spectrum intravenous antibiotics (such as a penicillin or cephalosporin plus metronidazole) and expediting delivery of the baby, regardless of gestational age, to remove the source of infection.<br /><br /><b>Bacterial vaginosis</b> (BV) is an incorrect diagnosis in this context. While BV is characterised by a change in the vaginal flora and can produce a foul-smelling, thin, greyish discharge, it is primarily a localised condition of the vagina. It is a known risk factor for PPROM and subsequent chorioamnionitis, so it may have been a preceding condition in this patient. However, BV itself does not cause systemic signs of infection such as a high fever of 39\u00b0C, uterine contractions, or the profound malaise described as 'flu-like symptoms'. The patient's clinical picture has clearly progressed beyond a simple vaginal infection to a severe, systemic, intra-uterine process. Therefore, while BV might be present, it is not the primary diagnosis explaining her acute deterioration.<br /><br /><b>Placental abruption</b> is a less likely diagnosis. This condition involves the premature separation of the placenta from the uterine wall. While it can cause significant abdominal pain and uterine contractions, its classic presentation involves painful vaginal bleeding, which is not mentioned in this scenario. Furthermore, placental abruption is a mechanical and haemorrhagic event, not an infectious one. It would not explain the high fever, 'flu-like symptoms', or the purulent, foul-smelling cervical discharge, which are all hallmark signs of infection. The patient's symptoms are far more consistent with sepsis originating from the uterus than with a placental bleed.<br /><br /><b>Urinary tract infection</b> (UTI), specifically pyelonephritis, is an important differential for a pregnant woman with a high fever and abdominal pain. Pyelonephritis can cause systemic upset, fever, and can even trigger uterine irritability and contractions. However, the diagnosis is made less likely by the absence of specific urinary symptoms (such as dysuria or frequency) and the presence of a key localising sign: the foul-smelling discharge originating from the cervix. This finding points directly to an intra-uterine source of infection. While a urine dipstick and culture should be performed as part of a sepsis screen, the clinical evidence in the stem makes an intra-amniotic infection the most probable cause of her presentation.<br /><br /><b>Appendicitis</b> is a plausible but incorrect diagnosis. It is one of the most common non-obstetric surgical emergencies in pregnancy and can present with fever, abdominal pain, and systemic illness. The diagnosis can be challenging as the gravid uterus displaces the appendix, altering the location of the pain. However, the patient's recent history of PPROM provides a very clear and direct risk factor for an ascending uterine infection. The combination of uterine contractions and a foul-smelling discharge specifically from the cervix strongly localises the pathology to the uterus. While appendicitis must be considered in a pregnant patient with an acute abdomen, the constellation of signs in this case points overwhelmingly towards chorioamnionitis.",

His diagnosis would be classified as a secondary pneumothorax.<br /><br />Patients with COPD are more at risk of pneumothorax in high-pressure ventilation due to weakness in their interstitial tissue. As their airway disease progresses, alveolar walls break down and alveoli join to form larger pockets of trapped air called bullae.
