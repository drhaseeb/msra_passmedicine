            "The correct answer in this case is to <b>order a HIV test</b>. The patient presents with weight loss, chronic diarrhoea, skin lesions, and oral lesions, which are all suggestive of an immunocompromised state.

In this scenario, it is crucial to identify the underlying cause of the patient's immunocompromised state in order to initiate appropriate management.<br /><br /><b>Give IM benzylpenicillin + phone 999</b> is not the most appropriate action in this case.

            "The correct answer to this question is <b>Hordeolum externum</b>. A hordeolum externum, also known as a stye, is an acute purulent inflammation of the glands of Zeis or Moll located in the eyelid margin. The image shows a localized red, swollen, and tender area on the right eye's upper lid margin which is characteristic of a hordeolum externum.<br /><br />The first option, <b>Conjunctivitis</b>, is incorrect. Conjunctivitis refers to inflammation of the conjunctiva - the thin transparent tissue that covers the white part of the eye (sclera) and lines the inside of the eyelids. It typically presents with bilateral red eyes, discharge that can be purulent or clear, and mild discomfort rather than pain. The absence of these symptoms in combination with a localized swelling at the lid margin makes conjunctivitis unlikely.<br /><br />The second option, <b>Chalazion</b>, is another common eyelid condition but it doesn't match our patient's presentation either. A chalazion results from blockage and subsequent inflammation of meibomian glands in the tarsal plate. It usually presents as a painless lump within the eyelid itself and not at its margin. Over time it may become inflamed leading to erythema and swelling but it lacks tenderness seen in hordeolum externum.<br /><br />Option three, <b>Ectropion</b>, refers to outward turning (eversion) of the lower eyelid margin away from the eyeball which causes exposure keratopathy (dryness), tearing due to poor tear drainage and redness due to conjunctival exposure. This condition typically affects elderly people secondary to age-related laxity of lower eyelid structures or following facial nerve palsy where the orbicularis oculi muscle becomes weak leading to ectropion.<br /><br />Finally, <b>Blepharitis</b> was also incorrectly selected by some students. Blepharitis is inflammation affecting both upper and lower lid margins causing irritation, burning sensation and crusting around lashes especially upon waking up. It's often associated with skin conditions like seborrheic dermatitis or infestation with *Demodex* mites but not seen here.",
