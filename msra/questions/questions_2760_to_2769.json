        "body": "Patients are at risk of a number of immediate, early and late complications following a myocardial infarction (MI).<br /><br /><h5 class='notes-heading'>Cardiac arrest</h5><br />This most commonly occurs due to patients developing ventricular fibrillation and is the most common cause of death following a MI. Patients are managed as per the ALS protocol with defibrillation.<br /><br /><h5 class='notes-heading'>Cardiogenic shock</h5><br />If a large part of the ventricular myocardium is damaged in the infarction the ejection fraction of the heart may decrease to the point that the patient develops cardiogenic shock. This is difficult to treat. Other causes of cardiogenic shock include the 'mechanical' complications such as left ventricular free wall rupture as listed below. Patients may require inotropic support and/or an intra-aortic balloon pump.<br /><br /><h5 class='notes-heading'>Chronic heart failure</h5><br />As described above, if the patient survives the acute phase their ventricular myocardium may be dysfunctional resulting in chronic heart failure. Loop diuretics such as furosemide will decrease fluid overload. Both ACE-inhibitors and beta-blockers have been shown to improve the long-term prognosis of patients with chronic heart failure.<br /><br /><h5 class='notes-heading'>Tachyarrhythmias</h5><br /><span class=\"concept\" data-cid=\"6891\">Ventricular fibrillation</span>, as mentioned above, is the most common cause of death following a MI. Other common arrhythmias including ventricular tachycardia.<br /><br /><h5 class='notes-heading'>Bradyarrhythmias</h5><br />Atrioventricular block is more common following <span class=\"concept\" data-cid=\"7726\">inferior myocardial infarctions</span>.<br /><br /><h5 class='notes-heading'>Pericarditis</h5><br /><span class=\"concept\" data-cid=\"4052\">Pericarditis in the first 48 hours following a transmural MI is common</span> (c. 10% of patients). The pain is typical for pericarditis (worse on lying flat etc), a pericardial rub may be heard and a pericardial effusion may be demonstrated with an echocardiogram.<br /><br /><span class=\"concept\" data-cid=\"6892\">Dressler's syndrome</span> tends to occur around <span class=\"concept\" data-cid=\"1868\">2-6 weeks</span> following a MI. The underlying pathophysiology is thought to be an autoimmune reaction against antigenic proteins formed as the myocardium recovers. It is characterised by a combination of <span class=\"concept\" data-cid=\"6897\">fever</span>, <span class=\"concept\" data-cid=\"6898\">pleuritic pain</span>, pericardial effusion and a raised ESR. It is treated with NSAIDs.<br /><br /><span class=\"concept\" data-cid=\"6893\"><h5 class='notes-heading'>Left ventricular aneurysm</h5></span><br /><br />The ischaemic damage sustained may weaken the myocardium resulting in aneurysm formation. This is typically associated with <span class=\"concept\" data-cid=\"6900\">persistent ST elevation</span> and left ventricular failure. Thrombus may form within the aneurysm increasing the risk of stroke. Patients are therefore anticoagulated.<br /><br /><div class=\"container\"><div class=\"row\"><div class=\"col-md-3\"><a href=\"https://d32xxyeh8kfs8k.cloudfront.net/images_Passmedicine/ecg095b.png\" data-fancybox=\"gallery\" data-caption=\"Left ventricular aneurysm.

Patients present with acute heart failure secondary to cardiac tamponade (<span class=\"concept\" data-cid=\"6899\">raised JVP, pulsus paradoxus</span>, diminished heart sounds). Urgent pericardiocentesis and thoracotomy are required.<br /><br /><span class=\"concept\" data-cid=\"6895\"><h5 class='notes-heading'>Ventricular septal defect</h5></span><br /><br />Rupture of the interventricular septum usually occurs in the first week and is seen in around 1-2% of patients. Features: acute heart failure associated with a pan-systolic murmur. An echocardiogram is diagnostic and will exclude acute mitral regurgitation which presents in a similar fashion. Urgent surgical correction is needed.<br /><br /><h5 class='notes-heading'>Acute mitral regurgitation</h5><br />More common with infero-posterior infarction and may be due to <span class=\"concept\" data-cid=\"5382\">ischaemia or rupture of the papillary muscle</span>. Acute hypotension and <span class=\"concept\" data-cid=\"9166\">pulmonary oedema</span> may occur. An early-to-mid systolic murmur is typically heard.

        "body": "NICE updated their guidelines on the management of atrial fibrillation (AF) in 2021. <br /><br /><h5 class='notes-heading'>Does the patient need anticoagulation?</h5><br />The need for anticoagulation should be considered in patients with any history of AF, not just if they are in AF currently, i.e. the following groups should be assessed:<br /><ul><li>symptomatic or asymptomatic <span class=\"concept\" data-cid=\"5358\">paroxysmal</span>, persistent or permanent atrial fibrillation</li><li>atrial flutter</li><li>a continuing risk of arrhythmia recurrence after cardioversion back to sinus rhythm or catheter ablation</li></ul><br />NICE suggest using the <span class=\"concept\" data-cid=\"4020\"><b>CHA<sub>2</sub>DS<sub>2</sub>-VASc</b></span> score to determine the most appropriate anticoagulation strategy. This scoring system superceded the CHADS<sub>2</sub> score.<br /><br /><div class=\"table-responsive\"><table class = \"tlarge table table-striped table-bordered\"  data-role=\"table\" id=\"tableid1\" ><thead><tr><th></th><th>Risk factor</th><th>Points</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td> <b>C</b></td><td>Congestive heart failure</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td> <b>H</b></td><td>Hypertension (or treated hypertension)</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td> <b>A<sub>2</sub></b></td><td>Age >= 75 years</td><td>2</td></tr><tr><td></td><td>Age 65-74 years</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td> <b>D</b></td><td>Diabetes</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td> <b>S<sub>2</sub></b></td><td>Prior Stroke, TIA or thromboembolism</td><td>2</td></tr><tr><td> <b>V</b></td><td>Vascular disease (including ischaemic heart disease and peripheral arterial disease)</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td><b>S</b></td><td>Sex (female)</td><td>1</td></tr></tbody></table></div><br />The table below shows a suggested <span class=\"concept\" data-cid=\"1686\">anticoagulation strategy based on the score</span>:<br /><br /><div class=\"table-responsive\"><table class = \"tlarge table table-striped table-bordered\"  data-role=\"table\" id=\"tableid2\" ><thead><tr><th>Score</th><th>Anticoagulation</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>0</td><td>No treatment</td></tr><tr><td>1</td><td>Males: Consider anticoagulation<br />Females: No treatment (this is because their score of 1 is only reached due to their gender)</td></tr><tr><td>2 or more</td><td>Offer anticoagulation</td></tr></tbody></table></div><br />Remember that if a CHA<sub>2</sub>DS<sub>2</sub>-VASc score suggests no need for anticoagulation it is important to ensure a <span class=\"concept\" data-cid=\"10904\">transthoracic echocardiogram has been done to exclude valvular heart disease</span>, which in combination with AF is an absolute indication for anticoagulation.<br /><br /><br /><h5 class='notes-heading'>Assessing bleeding risk</h5><br />Doctors have always thought carefully about the risk/benefit profile of starting someone on warfarin. A history of falls, old age, alcohol excess and a history of previous bleeding are common things that make us consider whether anticoagulation is in the best interests of the patient., but NICE warn us <span class=\"concept\" data-cid=\"5359\">not to withhold anticoagulation solely on the grounds of age or risk falls</span>. NICE now recommend we formalise this risk assessment using the <span class=\"concept\" data-cid=\"11422\">ORBIT scoring system</span>. Previously the HAS-BLED scoring system was recommended.<br /><br /><div class=\"table-responsive\"><table class = \"tlarge table table-striped table-bordered\"  data-role=\"table\" id=\"tableid3\" ><thead><tr><th>Variable</th><th>Points</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td><span class=\"concept\" data-cid=\"11423\">Haemoglobin</span> <130 g/L  for males and < 120 g/L for females, or haemtocrit < 40% for males and < 36% for females</td><td>2</td></tr><tr><td>Age > 74 years</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>Bleeding history (GI bleeding, intracranial bleeding or haemorrhagic stroke)</td><td>2</td></tr><tr><td><span class=\"concept\" data-cid=\"11423\">Renal impairment</span> (GFR < 60 mL/min/1.73m<sup>2</sup>)</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>Treatment with antiplatelet agents</td><td>1</td></tr></tbody></table></div><br />There are no formal rules on how we act on the ORBIT score and individual patient factors should be taken into account. However, the following table acts as a guide: <br /><br /><div class=\"table-responsive\"><table class = \"tlarge table table-striped table-bordered\"  data-role=\"table\" id=\"tableid4\" ><thead><tr><th>ORBIT score</th><th>Risk group</th><th>Bleeds per 100 patient-years</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>0-2</td><td>Low</td><td>2.4</td></tr><tr><td>3</td><td>Medium</td><td>4.7</td></tr><tr><td>4-7</td><td>High</td><td>8.1</td></tr></tbody></table></div><br /><br /><h5 class='notes-heading'>If treatment is indicated, which anticoagulant?</h5><br />For many years warfarin was the anticoagulant of choice in atrial fibrillation. This changed following the development of <span class=\"concept\" data-cid=\"3635\"><b>direct oral anticoagulants (DOACs)</b></span>. These have the advantage of not requiring regular blood tests to check the INR and now recommended as the first-line anticoagulant for patients with AF. If a patient was previously started on warfarin, NICE recommend discussing switching to a DOAC during a routine follow-up appointment.<br /><br />The following DOACs are recommended by NICE for reducing stroke risk in AF:<br /><ul><li>apixaban</li><li>dabigatran</li><li>edoxaban</li><li>rivaroxaban</li></ul><br />Warfarin is now used second-line, in patients where a DOAC is contraindicated or not tolerated.<br /><br />Aspirin is not recommended for reducing stroke risk in patients with AF.",
