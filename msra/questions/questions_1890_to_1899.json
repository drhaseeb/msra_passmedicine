            "<b>Plan for ERCP within 24-48 hours</b> is the correct answer. This patient has a clinical and radiological diagnosis of ascending cholangitis secondary to an obstructing common bile duct stone. According to the Tokyo Guidelines (2018), which are widely adopted in the UK, ascending cholangitis is graded by severity. This patient, being haemodynamically stable without signs of organ dysfunction, likely has moderate (Grade II) cholangitis. The cornerstone of management is initial resuscitation with intravenous fluids and broad-spectrum antibiotics, which has already been commenced. The definitive treatment is biliary decompression to relieve the obstruction. For moderate cholangitis, early biliary drainage via ERCP is recommended, which is defined as being performed within 24-48 hours. This allows time for the antibiotics to take effect and for the patient to be stabilised, reducing the procedural risks associated with ERCP in an acutely septic patient.<br /><br /><b>Immediate endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP)</b> is incorrect. Emergent or immediate ERCP (typically within 12 hours) is reserved for patients with severe (Grade III) cholangitis. This is defined by the presence of organ dysfunction, such as cardiovascular collapse requiring vasopressors, acute kidney injury, or altered mental status. As this patient's observations are described as stable, immediate intervention is not warranted and carries a higher risk than a planned procedure after a period of stabilisation.<br /><br /><b>Urgent laparoscopic cholecystectomy</b> is not the most appropriate next step. While the source of the common bile duct stone is almost certainly the gallbladder, the immediate life-threatening issue is the biliary obstruction and associated sepsis (cholangitis). The priority is to decompress the biliary tree. A cholecystectomy does not address the distal common bile duct stone. Furthermore, performing major surgery on an acutely septic patient carries a significantly increased morbidity and mortality risk. The standard approach is to manage the cholangitis with ERCP and then consider an elective cholecystectomy at a later date to prevent recurrence.<br /><br /><b>Percutaneous transhepatic cholangiography (PTC)</b> is an alternative method for biliary drainage. It involves passing a needle through the liver into the biliary tree under radiological guidance. However, ERCP is the first-line modality for biliary decompression as it is less invasive and has a lower complication rate in most cases. PTC is typically reserved for situations where ERCP is unsuccessful, contraindicated, or anatomically not feasible (e.g., in patients with previous gastric bypass surgery).<br /><br /><b>Magnetic resonance cholangiopancreatography (MRCP)</b> is a non-invasive diagnostic investigation used to visualise the biliary tree. In this scenario, the diagnosis of an obstructing common bile duct stone has already been confidently made based on the clinical presentation and ultrasound findings. Proceeding to an MRCP would be redundant and would only serve to delay the necessary therapeutic intervention, which is biliary drainage. The next step should be therapeutic, not further diagnostic imaging.",

            "Both Marfan syndrome and Ehlers\u2013Danlos syndrome (EDS) are connective-tissue disorders that can present with overlapping features such as joint hypermobility and spontaneous pneumothorax. However, several key points make Marfan\u2019s the more likely diagnosis in this case.<br /><br />The patient\u2019s tall, thin build with long limbs is typical of a Marfanoid habitus. Individuals with Marfan syndrome often have increased arm span, long fingers, and a narrow face, whereas patients with Ehlers\u2013Danlos syndrome usually have normal or short stature and do not display such elongated skeletal proportions. The presence of pectus excavatum also supports Marfan\u2019s, as this chest wall deformity is a recognised feature of the condition due to overgrowth of costal cartilage; it is not typical in EDS.<br /><br />Recurrent spontaneous pneumothorax occurs in Marfan\u2019s because of apical blebs and lung tissue fragility resulting from fibrillin-1 defects. While EDS can occasionally cause pneumothorax, this is much rarer and is usually confined to the vascular subtype, which would also present with fragile, bruisable skin and a tendency to arterial rupture - features that are absent here.<br /><br />Joint hypermobility is present in both disorders, but in Marfan\u2019s it tends to be mild to moderate and part of the overall skeletal phenotype. In contrast, hypermobility in EDS is more severe and is accompanied by skin hyperextensibility, atrophic scarring, and delayed wound healing. The absence of these cutaneous findings makes EDS unlikely.<br /><br />In summary, the combination of tall stature, pectus excavatum, and recurrent pneumothorax in the absence of skin or vascular abnormalities strongly points towards Marfan syndrome rather than Ehlers\u2013Danlos syndrome.",

            "This patient is presenting with a near-fatal asthma attack, which is a life-threatening medical emergency. The clinical features of drowsiness and feeble respiratory effort, combined with the arterial blood gas results showing a severe respiratory acidosis (low pH, high pCO\u2082) and hypoxia, indicate impending respiratory arrest. The patient has failed to respond to maximal initial medical therapy. According to the British Thoracic Society (BTS) guidelines, patients with these features require immediate senior anaesthetic and intensive care support. The definitive management is to secure the airway and provide mechanical ventilation to rest the respiratory muscles, correct the acidosis and hypoxia, and allow time for bronchodilator and steroid therapy to work. Any delay in this step significantly increases mortality.<br /><br /><b>Administer IV aminophylline</b> is incorrect. While aminophylline is a second-line bronchodilator that can be considered in severe asthma unresponsive to initial treatment, it is not the priority in a patient with impending respiratory arrest. The primary problem here is ventilatory failure due to exhaustion, not just bronchospasm.

The clinical features of drowsiness and feeble respiratory effort, combined with the arterial blood gas results showing a severe respiratory acidosis (low pH, high pCO\u2082) and hypoxia, indicate impending respiratory arrest. The patient has failed to respond to maximal initial medical therapy. According to the British Thoracic Society (BTS) guidelines, patients with these features require immediate senior anaesthetic and intensive care support. The definitive management is to secure the airway and provide mechanical ventilation to rest the respiratory muscles, correct the acidosis and hypoxia, and allow time for bronchodilator and steroid therapy to work.
