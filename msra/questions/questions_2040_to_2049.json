NICE recommend that all decisions about thrombectomy take into account a patient's overall clinical status:<br /><ul><li>NICE recommend a pre-stroke functional status of less than 3 on the modified Rankin scale and a score of more than 5 on the National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale (NIHSS)</li></ul><br />Offer thrombectomy as soon as possible and within <span class=\"concept\" data-cid=\"9594\">6 hours of symptom onset</span>, together <span class=\"concept\" data-cid=\"9596\">with intravenous thrombolysis (if within 4.5 hours)</span>, to people who have:<br />acute ischaemic stroke and<br /><ul><li>confirmed occlusion of the <b>proximal anterior circulation</b> demonstrated by computed tomographic angiography (CTA) or magnetic resonance angiography (MRA) </li></ul><br />Offer thrombectomy as soon as possible to people who were last known to be well between <span class=\"concept\" data-cid=\"9595\">6 hours and 24 hours previously (including wake-up strokes)</span>:<br /><ul><li>confirmed occlusion of the <b>proximal anterior circulation</b> demonstrated by CTA or MRA and</li><li>if there is the <span class=\"concept\" data-cid=\"9595\">potential to salvage brain tissue, as shown by imaging such as CT perfusion or diffusion-weighted MRI sequences showing limited infarct core volume</span></li></ul><br /><i>Consider</i> thrombectomy together with intravenous thrombolysis (if within 4.5 hours) as soon as possible for people last known to be well up to 24 hours previously (including wake-up strokes):<br /><ul><li>who have acute ischaemic stroke and confirmed occlusion of the <b>proximal posterior circulation (that is, basilar or posterior cerebral artery)</b> demonstrated by CTA or MRA and</li><li>if there is the potential to salvage brain tissue, as shown by imaging such as CT perfusion or diffusion-weighted MRI sequences showing limited infarct core volume</li></ul><br /><br /><h5 class='notes-heading'>Secondary prevention</h5><br />Recommendations from NICE include:<br /><ul><li><span class=\"concept\" data-cid=\"10231\">clopidogrel is now recommended</span> by NICE ahead of combination use of aspirin plus modified-release (MR) dipyridamole in people who have had an ischaemic stroke</li><li><span class=\"concept\" data-cid=\"10232\">aspirin is recommended after an ischaemic stroke only if clopidogrel is contraindicated or not tolerated</span></li></ul><br /><span class=\"concept\" data-cid=\"4059\">Carotid endarterectomy</span> is recommend if the patient has suffered a stroke or TIA in the carotid territory and is not severely disabled<br /><ul><li>should only be considered if the stenosis > 50% according to North American Symptomatic Carotid Endarterectomy Trial (NASCET) criteria</li></ul>  - it should be noted that previous guidelines have used other reporting methods, that have resulted in different cut-offs, e.g. European Carotid Surgery Trial (ECST) with a cut-off of 70%<br /><ul><li>it should be performed as soon as possible within 7 days</li></ul>",

        "body": "Parkinsons disease should only be diagnosed, and management initiated, by a <span class=\"concept\" data-cid=\"5645\">specialist</span> with expertise in movement disorders. However, it is important for all doctors to be aware of the medications used in Parkinson's given the prevalence of this condition. NICE published guidelines in 2017 regarding the management of Parkinson's disease.<br /><br />For first-line treatment:<br /><ul><li>if the motor symptoms are affecting the patient's quality of life: <span class=\"concept\" data-cid=\"1213\">levodopa</span></li><li>if the motor symptoms are not affecting the patient's quality of life: dopamine agonist (non-ergot derived), levodopa or monoamine oxidase B (MAO-B) inhibitor</li></ul><br />Whilst all drugs used to treat Parkinson's can cause a wide variety of side-effects NICE produced tables to help with decision making:<br /><br /><div class=\"table-responsive\"><table class = \"tlarge table table-striped table-bordered\"  data-role=\"table\" id=\"tableid1\" ><thead><tr><th></th><th>Levodopa</th><th>Dopamine agonists</th><th>MAO-B inhibitors</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td><b>Motor symptoms</b></td><td><span class=\"concept\" data-cid=\"1214\">More improvement in motor symptoms</span></td><td>Less improvement in motor symptoms</td><td>Less improvement in motor symptoms</td></tr><tr><td><b>Activities of daily living</b></td><td><span class=\"concept\" data-cid=\"1214\">More improvement in activities of daily living</span></td><td>Less improvement in activities of daily living</td><td>Less improvement in activities of daily living</td></tr><tr><td><b>Motor complications</b></td><td>More motor complications</td><td>Fewer motor complications</td><td>Fewer motor complications</td></tr><tr><td><b>Adverse events</b></td><td>Fewer specified adverse events*</td><td>More specified adverse events*</td><td>Fewer specified adverse events*</td></tr></tbody></table></div>* excessive sleepiness, <span class=\"concept\" data-cid=\"4334\">hallucinations</span> and impulse control disorders<br /><br />If a patient continues to have symptoms despite optimal levodopa treatment or has developed dyskinesia then NICE recommend the addition of a dopamine agonist, MAO-B inhibitor or catechol-O-methyl transferase (COMT) inhibitor as an adjunct. Again, NICE summarise the main points in terms of decision making:<br /><br /><div class=\"table-responsive\"><table class = \"tlarge table table-striped table-bordered\"  data-role=\"table\" id=\"tableid2\" ><thead><tr><th></th><th>Dopamine agonists</th><th>MAO-B inhibitors</th><th>COMT inhibitors</th><th>Amantadine</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td><b>Motor symptoms</b></td><td>Improvement in motor symptoms</td><td>Improvement in motor symptoms</td><td>Improvement in motor symptoms</td><td>No evidence of improvement in motor symptoms</td></tr><tr><td><b>Activities of daily living</b></td><td>Improvement in activities of daily living</td><td>Improvement in activities of daily living</td><td>Improvement in activities of daily living</td><td>No evidence of improvement in activities of daily living</td></tr><tr><td><b>Off time</b></td><td>More off-time reduction</td><td>Off-time reduction</td><td>Off-time reduction</td><td>No studies reporting this outcome</td></tr><tr><td><b>Adverse events</b></td><td>Intermediate risk of adverse events</td><td>Fewer adverse events</td><td>More adverse events</td><td>No studies reporting this outcome</td></tr><tr><td><b>Hallucinations</b></td><td><span class=\"concept\" data-cid=\"4334\">More risk of hallucinations</span></td><td>Lower risk of hallucinations</td><td>Lower risk of hallucinations</td><td>No studies reporting this outcome</td></tr></tbody></table></div><br /><br /><h5 class='notes-heading'>Specific points regarding Parkinson's medication</h5><br />NICE reminds us of the risk of acute akinesia or neuroleptic malignant syndrome if medication is not taken/absorbed (for example due to gastroenteritis) and advise against giving patients a 'drug holiday' for the same reason.<br /><br />Impulse control disorders have become a significant issue in recent years. These can occur with any dopaminergic therapy but are more common with:<br /><ul><li><span class=\"concept\" data-cid=\"5640\">dopamine agonist therapy</span></li><li>a history of previous impulsive behaviours</li><li>a history of alcohol consumption and/or smoking</li></ul><br />If excessive daytime sleepiness develops then patients should not drive. Medication should be adjusted to control symptoms. Modafinil can be considered if alternative strategies fail.<br /><br />If orthostatic hypotension develops then a medication review looking at potential causes should be done. If symptoms persist then midodrine (acts on peripheral alpha-adrenergic receptors to increase arterial resistance) can be considered.<br /><br /><span class=\"concept\" data-cid=\"9533\">Consider glycopyrronium bromide to manage drooling of saliva in people with Parkinson's disease.</span><br /><br /><h5 class='notes-heading'>Further information regarding specific anti-Parkinson's medication</h5><br /><br />Levodopa<br /><ul><li>nearly always combined with a decarboxylase inhibitor (e.g. carbidopa or benserazide)<ul><li>this prevents the peripheral metabolism of levodopa to dopamine outside of the brain and hence can reduce side effects</li></ul></li><li>common adverse effects: <ul><li><span class=\"concept\" data-cid=\"6272\">dry mouth</span></li><li><span class=\"concept\" data-cid=\"6273\">anorexia</span></li><li><span class=\"concept\" data-cid=\"6274\">palpitations</span></li><li><span class=\"concept\" data-cid=\"6275\">postural hypotension</span></li><li><span class=\"concept\" data-cid=\"6276\">psychosis</span></li></ul></li><li>some adverse effects are due to the difficulty in achieving a steady dose of levodopa<ul><li><span class=\"concept\" data-cid=\"11755\">end-of-dose wearing off</span>: symptoms often worsen towards the end of dosage interval.

            "<b>Cubital tunnel syndrome</b> is correct. This is a classical description of ulnar nerve neuropathy. The ulnar nerve supplies sensory innervation to the palmar and dorsal aspects of 1.5 fingers medially. It has a motor component which can result in wasting and paralysis of intrinsic hand muscles (except lateral two lumbricals) and the hypothenar muscles. Froment's test can be used to test the function of the adductor pollicis muscle which is often weak in ulnar neuropathy.<br /><br /><b>Axillary nerve neuropathy</b> is incorrect. The axillary nerve has both a motor and a sensory distribution of innervation. It has motor fibres that innervate the deltoid muscle, acting as an abductor, flexor and extensor at the shoulder joint, as well as the teres minor muscle, allowing lateral rotation of the glenohumeral joint.  Its sensory function is from the superior lateral cutaneous nerve of arm, which sweeps around the posterior border of the deltoid and supplies the skin over the lower two-thirds of the posterior part of this muscle, as well as that covering the long head of the triceps brachii.<br /><br /><b>C8/T1 radiculopathy</b> is incorrect. C8/T1 radiculopathy can mimic ulnar nerve neuropathy. In this case, the preserved sensation of the forearm favours a diagnosis of cubital tunnel syndrome. The ulnar nerve does not provide sensation to the medial forearm, which is innervated by the medial antebrachial cutaneous nerve (C8 and T1).<br /><br /><b>Carpal tunnel syndrome</b> is incorrect. Median nerve dysfunction results in carpal tunnel syndrome characterised by sensory loss over the lateral 3.5 digits, and loss of motor function to the flexor muscles of the forearm and hand as well as those muscles responsible for flexion, abduction, opposition, and extension of the thumb.<br /><br /><b>Radial nerve neuropathy</b>  is incorrect. The radial nerve innervates the muscles located in the posterior arm and posterior forearm. Dysfunction, therefore, results in loss of elbow and wrist extension. It also supplies sensation to the postero-lateral aspect of the hand.",
