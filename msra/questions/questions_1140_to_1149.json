            "The correct answer is <b>Topical glyceryl trinitrate</b>. This is a first-line pharmacological treatment for anal fissures according to UK guidelines. It works by relaxing the internal anal sphincter, which reduces pressure and increases blood flow to promote healing of the fissure. Its side effects can include headaches or dizziness due to systemic absorption.<br /><br /><b>Oral bisacodyl</b> would not be the best next step as it is a stimulant laxative and while it may help with constipation, it doesn't directly treat the anal fissure itself. Moreover, overuse of stimulant laxatives can lead to electrolyte imbalance and dehydration.<br /><br /><b>Oral calcium channel blocker</b>, such as diltiazem, could potentially be used in the management of chronic anal fissures as they also relax the internal anal sphincter. However, they are typically considered second-line treatments when topical treatments have failed or are not tolerated due to side effects.<br /><br /><b>Topical steroid</b> is not recommended for use in treating anal fissures. While steroids can reduce inflammation, they do not have an effect on sphincter tone which is important in managing this condition. Additionally, long-term use of topical steroids especially in sensitive areas like anus can result in skin thinning.<br /><br />Finally, <b>Buccal glyceryl trinitrate prior to defecation</b> would not be appropriate here. Glyceryl trinitrate should be applied topically rather than taken buccally (via mouth) for this indication.

The Resuscitation Council guidelines on anaphylaxis have recently been updated. <b>Intramuscular adrenaline</b> is by far the most important drug in anaphylaxis and should be given as soon as possible. Previously IV hydrocortisone was also recommended but the evidence base for this was poor and it was removed in the 2021 update.<br /><br />The recommended doses for <span class=\"concept\" data-cid=\"2374\">adrenaline</span> are as follows: <a href='https://bnf.nice.org.uk/treatment-summaries/medical-emergencies-in-the-community/#:~:text=Anaphylaxis-,Anaphylaxis,-Adrenaline/epinephrine%20injection' title='BNF - Medical emergencies in the community' target='_blank' class='badge rounded-pill text-bg-light deeplink'>BNF</a> <br /><br /><div class=\"table-responsive\"><table class = \"tlarge table table-striped table-bordered\"  data-role=\"table\" id=\"tableid1\" ><thead><tr><th>Age</th><th>Adrenaline dose</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td><span class=\"concept\" data-cid=\"8666\">< 6 months</span></td><td>100 - 150 micrograms (0.1 - 0.15 ml 1 in 1,000)</td></tr><tr><td><span class=\"concept\" data-cid=\"8667\">6 months - 6 years</span></td><td>150 micrograms (0.15 ml 1 in 1,000)</td></tr><tr><td>6-12 years</td><td><span class=\"concept\" data-cid=\"1696\">300 micrograms (0.3ml 1 in 1,000)</span></td></tr><tr><td>Adult and child > 12 years</td><td><span class=\"concept\" data-cid=\"424\">500 micrograms (0.5ml 1 in 1,000)</span></td></tr></tbody></table></div><br />Adrenaline can be repeated every <span class=\"concept\" data-cid=\"4666\">5 minutes</span> if necessary.

            "The correct answer is <b>Amiodarone</b>. Amiodarone is a potent antiarrhythmic drug with a long half-life. It is highly lipid-soluble and therefore, extensively stored in body tissues, including breast milk. This can result in significant exposure to the breastfeeding infant, potentially causing neonatal hypothyroidism or hyperthyroidism. Hence, it is contra-indicated during breastfeeding.<br /><br /><b>Aminophylline</b> is used as a bronchodilator for managing asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). Although it appears in breast milk, the amount ingested by the infant is small and usually without adverse effects on the infant.<br /><br /><b>Carbamazepine</b>, an anticonvulsant and mood stabiliser, does pass into breast milk but at levels that are generally considered safe for most infants. However, monitoring the nursing infant for potential side effects such as excessive sleepiness or skin reactions may be advisable.<br /><br /><b>Sodium valproate</b>, another anticonvulsant and mood stabiliser, also passes into breast milk but again at levels that are generally considered safe for most infants.
