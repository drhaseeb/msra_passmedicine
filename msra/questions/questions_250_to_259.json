            "<b>Chronic open-angle glaucoma</b> is the correct answer. The symptoms this patient is having are indicative of chronic glaucoma, which often presents with peripheral vision loss that comes on slowly so patients don't notice it. Glaucoma can occur in patients with normal intraocular pressure. Furthermore, the investigations conducted point toward a diagnosis of glaucoma, especially the increased cup-to-disc ratio. Gonioscopy reveals a normal drainage angle and therefore this is open-angle glaucoma. <br /><br /><b>Dry age-related macular degeneration</b> is incorrect in this case. Typically macular degeneration presents with blurred central vision and metamorphopsia. Patients often complain that straight lines become curved. Furthermore, drusen are common on ophthalmoscopy in age-related macular degeneration. Changes in the cup-to-disc ratio are not associated with age-related macular degeneration. <br /><br /><b>Hypertensive retinopathy</b> is incorrect in this case. Hypertensive retinopathy is often asymptomatic but can present with reduced acuity. The fact that this patient has no past medical history makes hypertensive retinopathy unlikely. Hypertensive retinopathy has a characteristic appearance on ophthalmoscopy, and there will be signs of arteriovenous nipping and copper wiring signs. Furthermore, hypertensive retinopathy is not associated with cup-to-disc ratio changes. <br /><br /><b>Optic neuritis</b> is incorrect. Optic neuritis is commonly found as a symptom of multiple sclerosis. Typically it presents as a painful loss of vision, often with the first signs being a loss of colour vision or acuity. This typically occurs over hours to days. The lack of any loss of acuity or colour vision rules out optic neuritis. Furthermore, you would expect to see other signs of multiple sclerosis such as sensory or motor symptoms, or other cranial nerve palsies. <br /><br /><b>Peripheral cataract</b> is incorrect. Cataracts are often asymptomatic if they aren't in the visual axis. If they do present with symptoms it is generally a loss of vision with problems such as haloes due to light scattering. A peripheral cataract can easily be visualised on slit lamp examination, and there would be no optic disc involvement.",

        "body": "Glaucomas are optic neuropathies associated with raised intraocular pressure (IOP). They can be classified based on whether the peripheral iris is covering the trabecular meshwork, which is important in the drainage of aqueous humour from the anterior chamber of the eye. In primary open-angle glaucoma (POAG), the iris is clear of the meshwork. The trabecular network functionally offers an increased resistance to aqueous outflow, causing increased IOP. It is now recognised that a minority of patients with raised IOP do not have glaucoma and vice versa.<br /><br />Risk factors:<br /><ul><li>increasing age<ul><li>affects < 1'5 in individuals under 55 years of age</li><li>but up to 10% over the age of 80 years</li></ul></li><li>genetics<ul><li>first degree relatives of an open-angle glaucoma patient have a 16% chance of developing the disease</li></ul></li><li>Afro Caribbean ethnicity</li><li>myopia</li><li>hypertension</li><li>diabetes mellitus</li><li><span class=\"concept\" data-cid=\"6025\">corticosteroids</span></li></ul><br />POAG may present insidiously and for this reason is often detected during routine optometry appointments.

NICE recommends adding a calcium channel blocker if blood pressure remains uncontrolled despite taking an ACE inhibitor and a thiazide diuretic.<br /><br />Loop diuretics may be indicated in resistant hypertension where blood pressure remains uncontrolled with the optimal or maximum tolerated doses of four drugs. Hence, the answer furosemide is incorrect.<br /><br />Aldosterone antagonist such as spironolactone and alpha-blocker such as doxazosin are indicated for the management of hypertension if blood pressure remains uncontrolled whilst taking a combination of an ACE inhibitor or angiotensin II receptor blocker, a calcium-channel blocker, and a thiazide-like diuretic.

        "question_notes": "The correct answer is amlodipine. NICE recommends adding a calcium channel blocker if blood pressure remains uncontrolled despite taking an ACE inhibitor and a thiazide diuretic.<br /><br />Loop diuretics may be indicated in resistant hypertension where blood pressure remains uncontrolled with the optimal or maximum tolerated doses of four drugs. Hence, the answer furosemide is incorrect.<br /><br />Aldosterone antagonist such as spironolactone and alpha-blocker such as doxazosin are indicated for the management of hypertension if blood pressure remains uncontrolled whilst taking a combination of an ACE inhibitor or angiotensin II receptor blocker, a calcium-channel blocker, and a thiazide-like diuretic. Hence, the answers spironolactone and doxazosin are incorrect.<br /><br />ACE inhibitor should not be used in combination with angiotensin receptor blocker in the management of hypertension. Hence, this answer is incorrect.",

            "The correct answer to this question is <b>Erythema nodosum</b>. Erythema nodosum is a type of panniculitis, or inflammation of the subcutaneous fat, and it is one of the extra-intestinal manifestations of Crohn's disease that correlates with disease activity. This means that when the Crohn's disease flares up, erythema nodosum may also appear or worsen, and when the Crohn's disease is controlled, erythema nodosum often improves. It presents as painful red or purple nodules on the shins.<br /><br /><b>Uveitis</b> is an incorrect answer. Uveitis refers to inflammation of the uvea in the eye and can be a complication of many systemic diseases including Crohn's disease. However, uveitis does not correlate with Crohn's disease activity; it can occur even when the intestinal disease is well-controlled.<br /><br /><b>Primary sclerosing cholangitis (PSC)</b> is also an incorrect answer. PSC is a chronic liver disease characterised by inflammation and fibrosis of bile ducts leading to cirrhosis and liver failure. While PSC is associated with inflammatory bowel diseases like ulcerative colitis more commonly than Crohn's disease, its onset or worsening does not correlate with intestinal disease activity.<br /><br /><b>Clubbing</b>, an enlargement or bulging of fingertips often associated with lung diseases but can also be seen in gastrointestinal disorders such as Crohn's Disease, too does not correlate directly with the activity of Crohn's Disease.<br /><br />Lastly, <b>Pyoderma gangrenosum</b>, a rare skin condition causing large ulcers usually on legs but can occur anywhere on your skin or mucous membranes, although it can occur in people with Crohn's Disease, its presence does not necessarily reflect active intestinal inflammation.<br /><br />In summary, among these options given for extraintestinal manifestations of Crohn's Disease only erythema nodosum correlates with active intestinal inflammation.",
