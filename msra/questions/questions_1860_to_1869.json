The precise aetiology is unknown, however it is associated with the hormonal changes that occur following ovulation.  The absence of PMS before puberty, in pregnancy and after the menopause further support this theory.<br /><br />The type of treatment is determined by the severity of symptoms, patient preference and desire for pregnancy.<br /><br />Management of PMS includes lifestyle advice - healthy diet, exercise, reduction in stress levels and regular sleep.<br />The combined oral contraceptive pill and selective serotonin re-uptake inhibitors are recommended for moderate to severe symptoms.<br /><br />Progesterone alone is not recommended for women with PMS, due to insufficient evidence on efficacy.<br /><br />Most complementary treatments, for example pyridoxine (vitamin B6) are not recommended due to little evidence on their benefits and weak or inconclusive evidence regarding safety.<br />",

Black hairy tongue is a benign condition characterized by the elongation and discolouration of the filiform papillae on the dorsal surface of the tongue. The brown or black coating seen in this case is due to the accumulation of keratin and dead cells, as well as staining from food, drinks, or tobacco products. Although it may cause some discomfort or tickling sensation, it is generally asymptomatic and can be managed with good oral hygiene practices.<br /><br /><b>Lichen Planus</b> is an incorrect option because it typically presents as white lacy streaks (Wickham's striae) on the buccal mucosa or other areas within the oral cavity. It may also present with erythematous patches or ulcerations but does not cause a brown coating on the tongue.<br /><br /><b>Oral <i>Candida</i></b>, also known as oral thrush, is caused by an overgrowth of <i>Candida</i> species in the mouth. It presents as white curd-like plaques that can be wiped off, revealing an erythematous base underneath. It does not cause a brown coating on the tongue.<br /><br /><b>Iron-deficiency anaemia</b> can present with glossitis (inflammation of the tongue), which may make the tongue appear smooth and shiny due to atrophy of the papillae. However, it does not cause a brown coating on the tongue as seen in this case.<br /><br />Finally, <b>Hairy leukoplakia</b> is an incorrect option because it usually appears as white, corrugated lesions most commonly found on the lateral borders of the tongue. It is often associated with immunosuppression, particularly in patients with HIV/AIDS. Hairy leukoplakia does not present as a brown coating on the dorsal surface of the tongue.",

Although it may cause some discomfort or tickling sensation, it is generally asymptomatic and can be managed with good oral hygiene practices.<br /><br /><b>Lichen Planus</b> is an incorrect option because it typically presents as white lacy streaks (Wickham's striae) on the buccal mucosa or other areas within the oral cavity. It may also present with erythematous patches or ulcerations but does not cause a brown coating on the tongue.<br /><br /><b>Oral <i>Candida</i></b>, also known as oral thrush, is caused by an overgrowth of <i>Candida</i> species in the mouth. It presents as white curd-like plaques that can be wiped off, revealing an erythematous base underneath. It does not cause a brown coating on the tongue.<br /><br /><b>Iron-deficiency anaemia</b> can present with glossitis (inflammation of the tongue), which may make the tongue appear smooth and shiny due to atrophy of the papillae. However, it does not cause a brown coating on the tongue as seen in this case.<br /><br />Finally, <b>Hairy leukoplakia</b> is an incorrect option because it usually appears as white, corrugated lesions most commonly found on the lateral borders of the tongue. It is often associated with immunosuppression, particularly in patients with HIV/AIDS. Hairy leukoplakia does not present as a brown coating on the dorsal surface of the tongue.",

Therefore, <b>anti-streptolysin O titre</b> is correct. This measures antibodies against streptolysin O, a substance produced by group A streptococcus bacteria. <br /><br /><b>Heterophil antibody test (Monospot test)</b> is incorrect. Monospot is used in the diagnosis of glandular fever which may cause a sore throat and malaise but would not typically cause haematuria, hypertension, or proteinuria which are mentioned in this patient.<br /><br /><b>Mid-stream urine culture and sensitivity</b> is incorrect. This would be indicated if there were symptoms of a urinary tract infection, as part of a septic screen, or if the urine dip was positive for nitrites. However, there is no mention of any of these factors in this patient.<br /><br /><b>Throat swab for bacterial culture</b> is incorrect. This can be used to confirm the diagnosis of active group A streptococcal infection. However, this is likely to be negative in this scenario because she no longer has symptoms of streptococcal throat infection. It would also cause unnecessary delay in the diagnosis because a positive culture can take several days. <br /><br /><b>Throat swab for viral PCR</b> is incorrect. This is a test to identify viral pathogens that cause upper and lower respiratory tract infections. For example, influenza and coronavirus. These organisms do not cause glomerulonephritis.",
