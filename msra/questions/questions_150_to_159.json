Younger patients should be assessed in the presence of risk factors, such as:<br /><ul><li>previous fragility fracture</li><li>current use or frequent recent use of oral or systemic glucocorticoid</li><li>history of falls</li><li>family history of hip fracture</li><li>other causes of secondary osteoporosis, for example:<ul><li>hypogonadism in either sex including low testosterone in men and premature menopause in women</li><li>endocrine conditions, including diabetes mellitus, Cushing's disease, hyperthyroidism</li><li>conditions associated with malabsorption, including inflammatory bowel disease, coeliac disease, and chronic pancreatitis.</li><li>rheumatoid arthritis and other inflammatory arthropathies.</li></ul></li><li>low body mass index (BMI) (less than 18.5 kg/m\u00b2)</li><li>smoking</li><li>alcohol intake of more than 14 units per week for women and more than 14 units per week for men.</li></ul><br /><br /><h5 class='notes-heading'>Methods of risk assessment</h5><br />The first step is to <span class=\"concept\" data-cid=\"12223\">exclude secondary causes</span> of osteoporosis as underlying conditions may also require treatment. Examples of secondary causes are listed above.<br /><br />If a patient has had a recent fragility fracture, non-osteoporotic causes should be looked for, for example, bone metastases, myeloma and Paget's disease.<br /><br />A DEXA scan should be offered without calculating the fragilty risk score in the following situations:<br /><ul><li><span class=\"concept\" data-cid=\"12225\">> 50 years of age with a history of fragility fracture</span></li><li>< 40 years of age who have a major risk factor for fragility fracture - these patients should be referred to a specialist depending on the T-score</li><li>before starting treatments that may have a rapid adverse effect on bone density (for example, sex hormone deprivation for treatment for breast or prostate cancer)</li></ul><br /><h6 class='notes-subheading'>Fragility fracture risk score</h6><br />NICE recommends using a clinical prediction tool such as <span class=\"concept\" data-cid=\"12224\">FRAX or QFracture</span> to assess a patient's 10-year risk of developing a fracture. These take into account a number of factors, including the risk factors listed above. This is analogous to the cardiovascular risk tools such as QRISK.<br /><br /><h5 class='notes-heading'>Interpreting the results of FRAX</h5><br />It is important to note though that there is a lot of room for pragmatism and clinical judgement in these guidelines. This reflects the approximate nature of risk scoring and multiple factors that determine fracture risk. <br /><br />QFracture<br /><ul><li><span class=\"concept\" data-cid=\"12226\">if the 10-year fracture risk is \u2265 10% then a DEXA scan should be arranged</span></li></ul><br />FRAX<br /><ul><li>a colour 'risk' is given by the calculator - green, orange or red</li><li>patients in the orange zone should have a DEXA scan if not already done to further refine their 10-year risk</li><li>patients in the red zone should also have a DEXA scan if not already done to act as a baseline and guide drug treatment</li></ul><br /><h5 class='notes-heading'>When should we reassess a patient's risk?</h5><br />NICE recommend that we recalculate a patient's risk (i.e. repeat the FRAX/QFracture):<br /><div class='bs-callout bs-callout-default'><i><i><br /><ul><li>if the original calculated risk was in the region of the intervention threshold for a proposed treatment and only after a minimum of 2 years, or</li><li>when there has been a change in the person's risk factors</li></ul></i></i></div>",

        "body": "A transient ischaemic attack (TIA), as the name suggests, is a brief period of neurological deficit due to a vascular cause, typically lasting less than an hour. The National Clinical Guideline for Stroke was published in 2023 and made a number of updated recommendations, including the use of dual antiplatelet therapy (DAPT). It should be noted that DAPT is not currently recommended for 'major' ischaemic stroke as the risk of haemorrhagic transformation is too high.<br /><br />The original definition of a TIA was time-based: a sudden onset of a focal neurologic symptom and/or sign lasting less than 24 hours, brought on by a transient decrease in blood flow. However, this has now changed as it is recognised that even short periods of ischaemia can result in pathological changes to the brain.

            "The correct answer is <b>Horner's syndrome</b>. Horner's syndrome, also known as oculosympathetic paresis, is a rare condition characterised by a triad of ptosis (drooping eyelid), miosis (constricted pupil), and anhidrosis (lack of sweating) on the affected side of the face. <br /><br />In the photo, a right-sided ptosis and miosis can be seen pointing to a diagnosis of Horner's syndrome. This condition results from a disruption in the sympathetic nerve supply to the eye. The clinical presentation described fits perfectly with Horner's syndrome.<br /><br /><b>Argyll-Robertson pupil</b> is incorrect because this condition typically presents with bilateral small pupils that constrict when the patient focuses on a near object but do not react to direct or consensual light stimulation. They are often referred to as 'prostitute's pupils' because they 'accommodate but do not react'. It is seen primarily in patients with neurosyphilis, which does not fit with the presented case.<br /><br /><b>Sixth nerve palsy</b> is also incorrect. A sixth cranial nerve palsy would present with horizontal double vision that increases when looking towards the affected side due to paralysis of the lateral rectus muscle, which abducts the eye. There would be no associated ptosis or miosis.<br /><br />Similarly, <b>third nerve palsy</b> is incorrect as it typically presents with drooping of the eyelid (ptosis), dilation of the pupil (mydriasis), upward and outward deviation of the eye ('down & out' appearance) and inability to move eye inward and downward due to paralysis of the medial rectus and inferior rectus muscles respectively. In contrast, Horner's syndrome causes constriction of the pupil rather than dilation.<br /><br />Finally, <b>Holmes-Adie pupil</b>, also known as tonic pupil, is incorrect. This condition presents with a unilateral dilated pupil that reacts poorly to light but shows slow constriction on accommodation. It may be associated with absent reflexes elsewhere in the body such as the ankle-jerk reflex. Holmes-Adie syndrome doesn't cause ptosis which was observed in our patient.<br />",

        "body": "Subconjunctival haemorrhages result from the bleeding of blood vessels into the subconjunctival space. The vessels that bleed are usually the ones responsible for supplying the conjunctiva or episclera.  The cause is most commonly traumatic followed by spontaneous idiopathic cases, Valsalva manoeuvres and several systemic diseases. Subconjunctival haemorrhages can look dramatic and cause worry to patients, however they are rarely an indicator of anything sinister.<br /><br /><h5 class='notes-heading'>Epidemiology:</h5><br /><ul><li>Subconjunctival haemorrhages are more common in women than in men when there has been no history of trauma</li><li>The annual incidence of non-traumatic subconjunctival haemorrhages is 0.6%, the risk increases with age as the risk factors are more common in elderly patients. Newborns are also more susceptible </li><li>The incidence of both traumatic and non-traumatic subconjunctival haemorrhages is 2.6% </li></ul><br /><h5 class='notes-heading'>Risk factors:</h5><br /><ul><li>Trauma and contact lens usage (68%): these are the most common causes generally, as well as being often the sole risk factor in younger patients</li><li>Idiopathic</li><li>Valsalva manoeuvre e.g. coughing, straining  </li><li>Hypertension</li><li>Bleeding disorders</li><li>Drugs such as aspirin, NSAIDs and anticoagulants</li><li>Diabetes</li><li>Arterial disease and hyperlipidaemia</li></ul><br /><h5 class='notes-heading'>Symptoms:</h5><br /><ul><li>Red-eye, usually unilateral</li><li>Subconjunctival haemorrhages are mostly asymptomatic, however mild irritation may be present</li></ul>  <br /><h5 class='notes-heading'>Signs:</h5><br /><ul><li>Flat, red patch on the conjunctiva. It will have well-defined edges and normal conjunctiva surrounding it. Patches can vary in size depending on the size of the bleed, and can involve the whole conjunctiva </li><li>Traumatic haemorrhages are most common in the temporal region (40.5%), with the inferior conjunctiva as the next most commonly affected area</li><li>Vision should be normal, including acuity, visual fields and range of eye movements</li><li>On examination, the fundus should be normal</li></ul><br /><b>Investigations:</b><br /><ul><li>The diagnosis of a subconjunctival haemorrhage is a clinical one</li><li>If there is no obvious traumatic cause, check the patient's blood pressure. If raised, refer the patient appropriately</li><li>If the patient is taking warfarin, check the INR. If raised, refer for appropriate adjustments to the dose to bring the INR back into the target range</li><li>If you cannot see the whole border of the haemorrhage i.e. the full extent of the haemorrhage is unclear, it may be associated with an intracranial bleed or an orbital roof fracture. This is often corroborated with a history of trauma and a black eye. Further appropriate investigations should then be done, including a full cranial nerve exam looking for neurological signs as well as a CT head, after discussion with a senior</li><li>Recurrent or spontaneous, bilateral subconjunctival haemorrhages warrant investigations for bleeding disorders or other pathology  </li></ul><br /><b>Management:</b><br /><ul><li>Reassure the patient that whilst a subconjunctival haemorrhage may look alarming, it is a benign condition that will resolve on its own in 2 to 3 weeks. If the patient presents to services immediately after the haemorrhage occurs, it can spread over a couple of days until it begins to resolve. The colour of the patch may change to yellow/ green, like a bruise, but preparing the patient for this will prevent any alarm if this happens. </li><li>If the cause is traumatic consider a referral to the ophthalmologist to ensure no other damage has been caused to the eye</li><li>Advise the patient to consult their GP if this happens again because, as previously mentioned, recurrent subconjunctival haemorrhages warrant investigations for bleeding disorders or other potential pathology</li><li>Artificial tears can be used for a couple of weeks if there is any mild irritation</li></ul><br /><h5 class='notes-heading'>Prognosis:</h5><br /><ul><li>This is a mild, self-limiting illness and should resolve on it's own in 2-3 weeks</li></ul>",
