            "The correct answer is <b>prescribe a 7-day course of nitrofurantoin</b>. Although this woman is asymptomatic, bacteriuria in pregnancy should always be treated to avoid progression to symptomatic urinary tract infection or pyelonephritis. Nitrofurantoin can safely be prescribed in the first and second trimester, though is contraindicated in the third trimester due to increased risk of neonatal haemolysis. This woman's blood pressure is <140/90 and does not require treatment. The trace of protein in her urine is likely related to her asymptomatic bacteriuria, but this should be monitored with subsequent urine dips. The trace of protein alone does not necessitate antihypertensive treatment.<br /><br /><b>Prescribe a 7-day course of trimethoprim</b> is incorrect, as trimethoprim is a folate-antagonist and therefore contraindicated in the first trimester of pregnancy due to the increased risk of neural-tube defects.<br /><br /><b>Prescribe aspirin, labetalol, and a 7-day course of nitrofurantoin</b> is incorrect, as this woman does not meet the diagnostic criteria for pre-eclampsia or pregnancy-induced hypertension, and as such aspirin and labetalol are not indicated. To diagnose pre-eclampsia women must be at least 20 weeks gestation and have a blood pressure higher than 140/90. Nitrofurantoin is the correct antibiotic to treat the patient's asymptomatic bacteriuria, though aspirin and labetalol are not indicated here.<br /><br /><b>Prescribe aspirin, labetalol, and a 7-day course of trimethoprim</b> is incorrect, as this woman does not meet the diagnostic criteria for pre-eclampsia or pregnancy-induced hypertension.

The clinical finding of distorted line perception on Amsler grid testing further supports this diagnosis. Drusen are associated with dry macular degeneration (the most common type of macular degeneration); these are small yellowish deposits of lipids that accumulate under the retina.<br /><br />AV nicking is seen on fundoscopy in hypertensive patients. It occurs when an arteriole crosses over the path of a venule, causing compression of the small veins with a slight bulge on either side of the crossing. This occurs as the arteriole's thicker walls push against those of the venule - causing the small veins to collapse slightly. A patient would be unlikely to present with changes in vision (such as reduced darkness tolerance) with hypertensive retinopathy.<br /><br />Cotton wool spots are associated with hypertensive and diabetic retinopathy. They are believed to occur secondary to retinal arteriole obstruction causing ischaemia. This patient has no past medical history of hypertension or diabetes - it is, therefore, unlikely to be this answer. Furthermore, cotton wool spots do not typically cause changes in vision.<br /><br />Cupping of the optic disc is seen in glaucoma and is due to damage to the optic nerve. Glaucoma presents with blurred vision (often in the peripheries), haloes around lights, and poor vision in the dark. This patient does have difficulty in the dark, however, her vision loss is more central - given these differences the diagnosis is unlikely.<br /><br />Flame haemorrhages are retinal haemorrhages that can be seen in hypertensive retinopathy.

        "body": "Age-related macular degeneration is the most common cause of blindness in the UK. Degeneration of the central retina (macula) is the key feature with changes usually bilateral. ARMD is characterised by degeneration of retinal photoreceptors that results in the formation of drusen which can be seen on fundoscopy and retinal photography. It is more common with advancing age and is more common in females.<br /><br />Risk factors<br /><ul><li>advancing age itself is the greatest risk factor for ARMD<ul><li>the risk of ARMD increases 3 fold for patients aged older than 75 years, versus those aged 65-74.</li></ul></li><li><span class=\"concept\" data-cid=\"640\">smoking</span><ul><li>current smokers are twice as likely as non-smokers to have ARMD related visual loss, and ex-smokers have a slightly increased risk of developing the condition, (OR 1.13). </li></ul></li><li>family history is also a strong risk factor for developing ARMD<ul><li>first degree relatives of a sufferer of ARMD are thought to be four times more likely to inherit the condition.</li></ul></li><li>other risk factors for developing the condition include those associated with an increased risk of ischaemic cardiovascular disease, such as hypertension, dyslipidaemia and diabetes mellitus. </li></ul><br /><br /><h5 class='notes-heading'>Classification</h5><br />Traditionally two forms of macular degeneration are seen:<br /><ul><li>dry macular degeneration<ul><li>90% of cases</li><li>also known as atrophic</li><li>characterised by <span class=\"concept\" data-cid=\"639\">drusen</span>  - yellow round spots in Bruch's membrane</li></ul></li><li>wet macular degeneration<ul><li>10% of cases</li><li>also known as exudative or neovascular macular degeneration</li><li>characterised by <span class=\"concept\" data-cid=\"11900\">choroidal neovascularisation</span></li><li>leakage of serous fluid and blood can subsequently result in a rapid loss of vision</li><li>carries the worst prognosis</li></ul></li></ul><br />Recently there has been a move to a more updated classification:<br /><ul><li>early age-related macular degeneration (non-exudative, age-related maculopathy): drusen and alterations to the retinal pigment epithelium (RPE)</li><li>late age-related macular degeneration (neovascularisation, exudative)</li></ul><br /><h5 class='notes-heading'>Clinical features</h5><br />Patients typically present with a subacute onset of visual loss with:<br /><ul><li>a reduction in visual acuity, particularly for near field objects<ul><li>gradual in dry ARMD </li><li>subacute in wet ARMD</li></ul></li><li><span class=\"concept\" data-cid=\"12500\">worse in the centre of vision</span> (e.g. difficulty reading, recognising faces, driving)</li><li>difficulties in dark adaptation with an overall deterioration in vision at night</li><li>fluctuations in visual disturbance which may vary significantly from day to day</li><li>they may also suffer from photopsia, (a perception of flickering or flashing lights), and glare around objects</li><li>visual hallucinations may also occur resulting in Charles-Bonnet syndrome</li></ul><br />Signs:<br /><ul><li>distortion of line perception may be noted on <span class=\"concept\" data-cid=\"11392\">Amsler grid testing</span></li><li>fundoscopy reveals the presence of drusen, yellow areas of pigment deposition in the macular area, which may become confluent in late disease to form a macular scar.</li><li>in wet ARMD well demarcated red patches may be seen which represent intra-retinal or sub-retinal fluid leakage or haemorrhage. </li></ul>   <br />Investigations:<br /><ul><li>slit-lamp microscopy is the initial investigation of choice, to identify any pigmentary, exudative or haemorrhagic changes affecting the retina which may identify the presence of ARMD. This is usually accompanied by colour fundus photography to provide a baseline against which changes can be identified over time.</li><li>fluorescein angiography is utilised if neovascular ARMD is suspected, as this can guide intervention with anti-VEGF therapy. This may be complemented with indocyanine green angiography to visualise any changes in the choroidal circulation. </li><li>optical coherence tomography is used to visualise the retina in three dimensions because it can reveal areas of disease which aren't visible using microscopy alone. </li></ul><br /><h5 class='notes-heading'>Management</h5><br />Treatment<br /><ul><li>the AREDS trial examined the treatment of dry ARMD in 3640 subjects. It showed that a combination of zinc with anti-oxidant vitamins A,C and E reduced progression of the disease by around one third. Patients with more extensive drusen seemed to benefit most from the intervention. Treatment is therefore recommended in patients with at least moderate category dry ARMD. </li><li><span class=\"concept\" data-cid=\"4069\">vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF)</span> <ul><li>VEGR is a potent mitogen and drives increased vascular permeability in patients with wet ARMD</li><li>a number of trials have shown that use of anti-VEGF agents can limit progression of wet ARMD and stabilise or reverse visual loss</li><li>evidence suggests that they should be instituted within the first two months of diagnosis of wet ARMD if possible</li><li>examples of anti-VEGF agents include ranibizumab, <span class=\"concept\" data-cid=\"11448\">bevacizumab</span> and pegaptanib,. The agents are usually administered by 4 weekly injection. </li></ul></li><li>laser photocoagulation does slow progression of ARMD where there is new vessel formation, although there is a risk of acute visual loss after treatment, which may be increased in patients with sub-foveal ARMD. For this reason anti-VEGF therapies are usually preferred.</li></ul>",
