            "<b>Cerebral palsy</b> is the correct answer. Hand preference before 12 months of age is abnormal and should raise concern for cerebral palsy. In typical development, children do not establish a clear hand preference until after 12-18 months of age. This 9-month-old demonstrating consistent right-hand use suggests weakness or dysfunction of the left side. The examination findings of increased tone in the left arm with fisting further support this diagnosis, indicating a spastic hemiplegia pattern. Cerebral palsy is a group of permanent movement disorders caused by non-progressive disturbances in the developing fetal or infant brain. Early recognition is crucial as it allows for timely referral to paediatric neurology and initiation of multidisciplinary interventions including physiotherapy, occupational therapy, and developmental support to optimise the child's functional outcomes.<br /><br /><b>Erb's palsy</b> typically results from birth trauma affecting the upper brachial plexus (C5-C6 nerve roots). While it can cause unilateral arm weakness, it presents with a characteristic \"waiter's tip\" posture with the arm adducted and internally rotated, wrist flexed, and loss of the Moro reflex on the affected side. The pattern would be flaccid rather than spastic, and increased tone would not be expected. Additionally, Erb's palsy is usually identified at or shortly after birth, and this child had no reported birth complications.<br /><br /><b>Normal development</b> is incorrect because hand preference before 12 months is definitively abnormal. Children typically show hand preference emerging between 12-18 months, with clear dominance established by 2-3 years. The presence of early hand preference, particularly when accompanied by increased tone and fisting, indicates underlying pathology rather than normal developmental variation.<br /><br /><b>Developmental coordination disorder</b> (DCD) is a motor skills disorder affecting coordination and movement planning. However, DCD is typically diagnosed in older children (usually after age 5) when motor coordination difficulties become more apparent in activities like writing, sports, or self-care tasks. It would not present with increased tone or early hand preference in infancy, and neurological examination would be normal.<br /><br /><b>Brachial plexus injury</b> encompasses various nerve injuries affecting the arm, including Erb's palsy. Like Erb's palsy, these injuries typically occur during difficult deliveries and present with flaccid weakness rather than spasticity. The history of uncomplicated term delivery makes this diagnosis unlikely.

It is crucial for clinicians to identify and address these delays promptly to improve long-term outcomes.<br /><br /><br /><h5 class='notes-heading'>Background</h5><br />The process of normal child development is complex and multifaceted, encompassing the maturation of various systems such as motor skills (gross and fine), language (expressive and receptive), cognitive abilities, and adaptive behaviours. Any disruption in this intricate process can lead to abnormal development. The root cause may be genetic disorders, prenatal exposure to toxins/drugs/alcohol, premature birth, nutritional deficiencies or environmental factors.<br /><br /><br /><h5 class='notes-heading'>Example issues</h5><br />Referral points<br /><ul><li>doesn't smile at 10 weeks</li><li>cannot sit unsupported at 12 months</li><li>cannot walk at 18 months</li></ul><br />Fine motor skill problems<br /><ul><li>hand preference before 12 months is abnormal and may indicate cerebral palsy</li></ul><br />Gross motor problems<br /><ul><li>most common causes of problems: variant of normal, cerebral palsy and neuromuscular disorders (e.g. Duchenne muscular dystrophy)</li></ul><br />Speech and language problems<br /><ul><li>always check hearing</li><li>other causes include environmental deprivation and general development delay</li></ul><br /><h5 class='notes-heading'>Differential Diagnosis</h5><br />The differential diagnosis for developmental delay is broad; however, some common causes include:<br /><br /><ul><li><b>Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD)</b>: Characterised by impairments in social interaction and communication alongside restricted interests and repetitive behaviours.</li><li><b>Cerebral Palsy:</b> A group of permanent movement disorders appearing in early childhood due to abnormal brain development or damage.</li><li><b>Fragile X Syndrome:</b> A genetic condition causing intellectual disability, behavioural challenges and various physical characteristics.</li><li><b>Down Syndrome:</b> A chromosomal disorder leading to intellectual disability and characteristic facial features.</li><li><b>Fetal Alcohol Spectrum Disorders (FASDs):</b> A range of effects that can occur in an individual exposed to alcohol before birth.</li></ul><br /><h5 class='notes-heading'>Initial Management</h5><br />The initial management of a child with suspected developmental delay involves the following steps:<br /><br /><ul><li><b>Clinical Examination:</b> A thorough physical and neurological examination to assess the child's developmental milestones.</li><li><b>Investigations:</b> These may include genetic testing, metabolic screening, neuroimaging studies (MRI or CT scan), and hearing/vision assessments.</li><li><b>Referral for Specialist Assessment:</b> If a specific cause is suspected, referral to a paediatric neurologist, geneticist or developmental paediatrician may be necessary.</li><li><b>Early Intervention Services:</b> Regardless of the underlying cause, all children with developmental delays can benefit from early intervention services such as occupational therapy, speech and language therapy, physiotherapy and educational support.</li></ul>",

According to the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) guidelines, an adult with type 1 diabetes mellitus should aim for a target HbA1c level of below 48 mmol/mol.

While these values are within the non-diabetic range, aiming for such low targets might increase the risk of hypoglycaemia, particularly in those with type 1 diabetes who are dependent on insulin injections. Hypoglycaemia can have serious consequences including confusion, loss of consciousness and seizures. Therefore, it's important that patients do not aim for overly aggressive targets which could put them at risk of hypoglycaemic episodes.<br /><br /><b>50 mmol/mol</b> and <b>52 mmol/mol</b>, while not dangerously high, are above the recommended target according to NICE guidelines.
