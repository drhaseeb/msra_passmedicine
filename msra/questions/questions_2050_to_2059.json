It presents with tense blisters on the skin, which can be pruritic. The blisters are usually found on the extremities and trunk, and mucosal involvement is less common compared to pemphigus vulgaris. The patient's age, presence of tense blisters on her legs, and lack of significant mucosal involvement make bullous pemphigoid the most likely diagnosis.<br /><br /><b>Pemphigus</b> is another autoimmune blistering disorder; however, it typically presents with flaccid blisters and erosions involving both the skin and mucous membranes. In this case, the patient has tense blisters without mucosal involvement, making pemphigus a less likely diagnosis.<br /><br />A <b>drug reaction to aspirin</b> could potentially cause a cutaneous eruption; however, drug reactions would more commonly present as a diffuse maculopapular rash or urticaria rather than localized tense blistering lesions. Furthermore, there is no mention of recent initiation or changes in aspirin therapy for this patient.<br /><br /><b>Epidermolysis bullosa</b> is a group of inherited disorders characterized by skin fragility and blister formation in response to minor trauma. This condition usually manifests at birth or during early childhood, making it an unlikely diagnosis for an 84-year-old woman presenting with new-onset blistering lesions.<br /><br /><b>Scabies</b> is a parasitic infestation caused by the mite <i>Sarcoptes scabiei</i>.

            "The correct answer is the <b>Intrauterine system</b>. The intrauterine system (IUS), such as Mirena, is a long-acting reversible contraceptive method that releases a progestogen hormone into the womb. This not only provides effective contraception but also has the additional benefit of reducing menstrual bleeding by thinning the lining of the womb. According to UK guidelines, IUS is recommended as first-line management for women with heavy menstrual bleeding who do not have pelvic pathology and would like to use long-term contraception.<br /><br /><b>Copper coil</b> or Intrauterine device (IUD) is incorrect because it can actually increase menstrual bleeding and cramping in some women, which would not be suitable for this patient who already experiences heavy periods. It is an effective method of contraception but without hormonal effects.<br /><br />The <b>Combined oral contraceptive pill</b> can help regulate periods and may reduce menstrual flow, however, this option might not be ideal for someone seeking a long-term solution as it requires daily administration. Moreover, it doesn't always result in lighter periods for all women.<br /><br />The <b>Progesterone-only pill</b>, also known as 'mini-pill', can sometimes cause irregular bleeding patterns including spotting between periods or heavier/longer periods in some women. Therefore, it may not be the most suitable option for this woman who already has heavy periods and wishes to lighten them.<br /><br />The <b>Subdermal implant</b>, such as Nexplanon, is a long-acting reversible contraceptive method that releases progestogen. However, its impact on menstruation varies widely among users: some women report amenorrhoea while others experience frequent or prolonged bleeding. Given this unpredictability and her desire for lighter periods, the intrauterine system would likely be more suitable.<br />",

            "The correct answer is <b>Graves' disease</b>, which is the most common cause of hyperthyroidism in young adults, particularly women. The patient's biochemistry shows a suppressed TSH and elevated T4, consistent with primary hyperthyroidism. Graves' disease is an autoimmune condition where thyroid-stimulating antibodies (TSAb) bind to TSH receptors, causing excessive thyroid hormone production. The typical presentation includes symptoms of thyroid hormone excess such as tremor and sweating, as seen in this case.
