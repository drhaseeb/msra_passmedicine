            "The correct answer is <b>Acute angle closure glaucoma</b>. This condition presents with a red eye, dilated pupil, and a hazy cornea due to increased intraocular pressure. The patient may also experience severe ocular pain, nausea and vomiting, blurred vision, and seeing halos around lights. It is an ophthalmic emergency that requires immediate treatment to prevent permanent vision loss.<br /><br /><b>Scleritis</b> is incorrect because it typically presents with severe ocular pain that can radiate to the forehead or jaw. The eye appears red, particularly in the area of the sclera. While this inflammation can cause some changes in vision, it does not typically cause a hazy cornea or a dilated pupil.<br /><br /><b>Conjunctivitis</b> is also incorrect as it usually presents with a red eye and discharge but not with pain, hazy cornea or dilated pupil. Conjunctivitis often affects both eyes whereas acute angle closure glaucoma generally starts in one eye.<br /><br /><b>Anterior uveitis</b>, or inflammation of the iris and ciliary body within the uvea of the eye, is another incorrect choice. While anterior uveitis can cause redness of the eye and pain, it typically causes photophobia rather than a hazy cornea. The pupil in anterior uveitis would be small (miotic) rather than dilated.<br /><br />Finally, <b>Subconjunctival haemorrhage</b> is incorrect as this condition presents with a bright red patch on the white part of the eye (sclera). It's often asymptomatic but may cause a sensation of fullness under the lid or mild irritation. It does not present with pain or visual changes such as hazy cornea or dilated pupils.<br />",

            "<b>Subcutaneous morphine 5mg stat</b> is the most appropriate immediate management for acute dyspnoea in this palliative care setting. When patients are experiencing severe, distressing breathlessness that has not responded to treatment of reversible causes, subcutaneous opioids provide rapid relief. The subcutaneous route is preferred over oral in acute situations as it has a faster onset of action (within 15-30 minutes compared to 60-90 minutes for oral). Morphine works by reducing the sensation of breathlessness through central mechanisms, decreasing respiratory drive and anxiety associated with dyspnoea. In palliative care, the benefits of symptom relief outweigh concerns about respiratory depression, particularly in patients already established on opioids. The dose should be calculated as approximately one-sixth of the total daily oral morphine dose for breakthrough relief.<br /><br /><b>Increase oral morphine to 40mg twice daily</b> would be inappropriate for acute management as oral medications take longer to achieve therapeutic effect. While increasing the background opioid dose may be considered for ongoing breathlessness management, it does not address the immediate need for rapid symptom relief. The oral route is also less reliable in acutely unwell patients who may have altered gastrointestinal absorption.<br /><br /><b>Oral lorazepam 0.5mg</b> may have a role if there is significant anxiety or panic associated with breathlessness, but it is not the first-line treatment for dyspnoea itself. Benzodiazepines can be useful adjuncts, particularly when combined with opioids, but alone they do not address the primary sensation of breathlessness as effectively as opioids.<br /><br /><b>Nebulised saline</b> has limited evidence for benefit in cancer-related dyspnoea and would not provide adequate relief for severe symptoms. While nebulised treatments may help with some respiratory conditions, they are not indicated as primary therapy for breathlessness in advanced cancer when reversible causes have been addressed.<br /><br /><b>High-flow oxygen therapy</b> is not routinely beneficial for cancer-related dyspnoea unless there is documented hypoxaemia. Many patients with advanced cancer experience breathlessness without significant oxygen desaturation, and oxygen therapy may provide false reassurance while delaying more effective symptomatic treatments.",

            "The correct answer is <b>Henoch-Schonlein purpura</b>. Henoch-Schonlein purpura (HSP), also known as IgA vasculitis, is a small vessel vasculitis characterised by palpable purpura, arthritis or arthralgia, abdominal pain and renal involvement. It often follows an upper respiratory tract infection and is most common in children. The palpable purpuric rash typically affects the lower limbs and buttocks.<br /><br /><b>Rubella</b>, the first incorrect option, presents with a pinkish-red maculopapular rash that starts on the face and spreads downwards. Other symptoms include fever, lymphadenopathy, and joint pains particularly in adult women. However, it does not present with a palpable purpuric rash.<br /><br />The second incorrect option is <b>Measles</b>. Measles is characterised by a prodromal phase of high fever, malaise, conjunctivitis, coryza and Koplik's spots followed by a generalised maculopapular rash which spreads from head to toe over 3 days. The rash isn't typically described as palpable or purpuric.<br /><br /><b>Erythema multiforme</b> was another incorrect option. This condition usually presents with target lesions (a red centre surrounded by a pale ring and then a red outer ring) following herpes simplex virus (HSV) infection or drug exposure. It does not typically present with polyarthralgia or follow an upper respiratory tract infection.<br /><br />Finally, <b>Idiopathic thrombocytopenic purpura</b> (ITP) was also incorrect. ITP can cause petechiae and bruising but it doesn't cause polyarthralgia or follow an upper respiratory tract infection like HSP does. Furthermore, while both conditions can cause a non-blanching rash due to blood leaking out of capillaries into the skin (causing purpura), the palpable nature of the rash seen in HSP helps distinguish between these two conditions.<br />",

        "body": "In 2014 NICE updated their guidelines on lipid modification. This proved highly controversial as it meant that we should be recommending statins to a significant proportion of the population over the age of 60 years. Anyway, the key points of the new guidelines are summarised below.<br /><br /><CENTER><table><tr><td align = 'left' colspan='2'><a data-fancybox class='fancybox' rel='group' href='https://d32xxyeh8kfs8k.cloudfront.net/images_Passmedicine/pdd915b.png'><img class='ajaximage' src='https://d32xxyeh8kfs8k.cloudfront.net/images_Passmedicine/pdd915.png'/></a></td></tr><tr><td valign='top' align='left'></td><td align='right'><a data-fancybox class='fancybox lbmagglasslink' rel='group' href='https://d32xxyeh8kfs8k.cloudfront.net/images_Passmedicine/pdd915b.png'><img src='https://d32xxyeh8kfs8k.cloudfront.net/css/images/mag_glass.png'/></a></td></tr></table></CENTER><div class='imagetext'>Graphic showing choice of statin.</div><br /><h5 class='notes-heading'>Primary prevention - who and how to assess risk</h5><br />A systematic strategy should be used to identify people aged over 40 years who are likely to be at high risk of cardiovascular disease (CVD), defined as a 10-year risk of <b>10%</b> or greater. <br /><br />NICE recommend we use the <b>QRISK2</b> CVD risk assessment tool for patients aged <= 84 years. Patients >= 85 years are at high risk of CVD due to their age. QRISK2 should not be used in the following situations as there are more specific guidelines for these patient groups:<br /><ul><li>type 1 diabetics</li><li>patients with an estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) less than 60 ml/min and/or albuminuria</li><li>patients with a history of familial hyperlipidaemia</li></ul><br />NICE suggest QRISK2 may underestimate CVD risk in the following population groups:<br /><ul><li>people treated for HIV</li><li>people with serious mental health problems</li><li>people taking medicines that can cause dyslipidaemia such as antipsychotics, corticosteroids or immunosuppressant drugs</li><li>people with autoimmune disorders/systemic inflammatory disorders such as systemic lupus erythematosus</li></ul><br /><br /><h5 class='notes-heading'>Measuring lipid levels</h5><br />When measuring lipids both the total cholesterol and HDL should be checked to provide the most accurate risk of CVD. A full lipid profile should also be checked (i.e. including triglycerides) before starting a statin. The samples do not need to be fasting.<br /><br />In the vast majority of patients the cholesterol measurements will be fed into the QRISK2 tool. If however, the patient's cholesterol is very high we should consider familial hyperlipidaemia. NICE recommend the following that we should consider the possibility of familial hypercholesterolaemia and investigate further if:<br /><ul><li>the total cholesterol level greater than 7.5 mmol/L and/or</li><li>there is a personal or family history of premature coronary heart disease (an event before 60 years in an index person or first-degree relative [parents, siblings, children])</li></ul><br /><br /><h5 class='notes-heading'>Interpreting the QRISK2 result</h5><br />Probably the headline change in the 2014 guidelines was the new, lower cut-off of 10-year CVD risk cut-off of 10%. <br /><br /><h5 class='notes-heading'>NICE now recommend we offer a statin to people with a QRISK2 10-year risk of >= 10%</h5><br />Lifestyle factors are of course important and NICE recommend that we give patients the option of having their CVD risk reassessed after a period of time before starting a statin.<br /><br />Atorvastatin 20mg should be offered first-line.<br /><br /><br /><h5 class='notes-heading'>Special situations</h5><br />Type 1 diabetes mellitus<br /><ul><li>NICE recommend that we 'consider statin treatment for the primary prevention of CVD in all adults with type 1 diabetes'</li><li>atorvastatin 20 mg should be offered if type 1 diabetics who are:<ul><li>older than 40 years, or</li><li>have had diabetes for more than 10 years or</li><li>have established nephropathy or</li><li>have other CVD risk factors</li></ul></li></ul><br />Chronic kidney disease (CKD)<br /><ul><li>atorvastatin 20mg should be offered to patients with CKD</li><li>increase the dose if a greater than 40% reduction in non-HDL cholesterol is not achieved and the eGFR > 30 ml/min. If the eGFR is < 30 ml/min a renal specialist should be consulted before increasing the dose</li></ul><br /><h5 class='notes-heading'>Secondary prevention</h5><br /><span class=\"concept\" data-cid=\"401\">All patients with CVD should be taking a statin in the absence of any contraindication.</span><br /><br />Atorvastatin 80mg should be offered first-line.<br /><br /><br /><h5 class='notes-heading'>Follow-up of people started on statins</h5><br />NICE recommend we follow up patients at 3 months<br /><ul><li>repeat a full lipid profile</li><li>if the non-HDL cholesterol has not fallen by at least 40% concordance and lifestyle changes should be discussed with the patient</li><li>NICE recommend we consider increasing the dose of atorvastatin up to 80mg</li></ul><br /><h5 class='notes-heading'>Lifestyle modifications</h5><br />These are in many ways predictable but NICE make a number of specific points:<br /><br />Cardioprotective diet<br /><ul><li>total fat intake should be <= 30% of total energy intake</li><li>saturated fats should be <= 7% of total energy intake</li><li>intake of dietary cholesterol should be < 300 mg/day</li><li>saturated fats should be replaced by monounsaturated and polyunsaturated fats where possible</li><li>replace saturated and monounsaturated fat intake with olive oil, rapeseed oil or spreads based on these oils</li><li>choose wholegrain varieties of starchy food</li><li>reduce their intake of sugar and food products containing refined sugars including fructose</li><li>eat at least 5 portions of fruit and vegetables per day</li><li>eat at least 2 portions of fish per week, including a portion of oily fish</li><li>eat at least 4 to 5 portions of unsalted nuts, seeds and legumes per week</li></ul><br />Physical activity<br /><ul><li>each week aim for at least 150 minutes of moderate-intensity aerobic activity or 75 minutes of vigorous-intensity aerobic activity or a mix of moderate and vigorous aerobic activity</li><li> do muscle-strengthening activities on 2 or more days a week that work all major muscle groups (legs, hips, back, abdomen, chest, shoulders and arms) in line with national guidance for the general population</li></ul><br />Weight management<br /><ul><li>no specific advice is given, overweight patients should be managed in keeping with relevant NICE guidance</li></ul><br />Alcohol intake<br /><ul><li>again no specific advice, other than the general recommendation: men and women are advised not to drink more than 14 units a week on a regular basis</li></ul><br />Smoking cessation<br /><ul><li>smokers should be encouraged to quit</li></ul>",

            "<b>Nebulised salbutamol in oxygen</b> is the correct answer. This patient has life-threatening asthma, evidenced by oxygen saturations <92%, PEFR <33% predicted, inability to complete sentences, tachycardia >110 bpm, tachypnoea >25/min, and a silent chest. According to BTS guidelines, patients with life-threatening features require high-dose nebulised beta-agonist therapy delivered via oxygen-driven nebuliser. The oxygen delivery serves two purposes: it provides supplemental oxygen to correct hypoxaemia (targeting SpO\u2082 94-98%) whilst simultaneously delivering the bronchodilator. This dual approach addresses both the immediate hypoxia and bronchospasm. Nebulised delivery ensures rapid onset of action and high drug deposition in the airways. This should be given alongside oral corticosteroids (prednisolone 40-50mg) and consideration of nebulised ipratropium bromide as an adjunct.<br /><br /><b>Salbutamol via pressurised metered-dose inhaler with spacer</b> is inappropriate in life-threatening asthma. Whilst pMDI with spacer is effective for moderate exacerbations and may be equivalent to nebulisers in acute severe asthma without life-threatening features, it is insufficient when life-threatening features are present. This patient's severe respiratory distress, silent chest, and hypoxaemia indicate the need for more aggressive bronchodilator delivery alongside oxygen therapy. The BTS specifically recommends nebulised therapy for life-threatening presentations.<br /><br /><b>Nebulised salbutamol in air</b> would be suboptimal management. Whilst the nebulised route is appropriate for life-threatening asthma, delivering it in air rather than oxygen fails to address this patient's significant hypoxaemia (SpO\u2082 88%). In life-threatening asthma with hypoxaemia, oxygen should be used as the driving gas for nebulisation, allowing simultaneous correction of hypoxia whilst delivering bronchodilator therapy. Air-driven nebulisers are reserved for patients at risk of hypercapnic respiratory failure, which is not the primary concern here.<br /><br /><b>Nebulised ipratropium bromide in oxygen</b> is an important adjunct in severe and life-threatening asthma but should not be used as first-line monotherapy. Short-acting beta-agonists like salbutamol provide more rapid and potent bronchodilation than anticholinergics. Ipratropium should be added to nebulised salbutamol in severe or life-threatening cases, or when initial beta-agonist therapy proves insufficient. Using ipratropium alone would delay the most effective bronchodilator treatment.<br /><br /><b>Intravenous salbutamol</b> is reserved for patients with life-threatening or near-fatal asthma who are deteriorating despite optimal inhaled therapy, or in situations where inhaled drug delivery is inadequate. It is not first-line management and requires senior critical care involvement due to potential adverse effects including tachycardia, arrhythmias, and hypokalaemia. This patient should first receive nebulised therapy, which is safer and usually effective when properly administered.",

The oxygen delivery serves two purposes: it provides supplemental oxygen to correct hypoxaemia (targeting SpO\u2082 94-98%) whilst simultaneously delivering the bronchodilator. This dual approach addresses both the immediate hypoxia and bronchospasm. Nebulised delivery ensures rapid onset of action and high drug deposition in the airways. This should be given alongside oral corticosteroids (prednisolone 40-50mg) and consideration of nebulised ipratropium bromide as an adjunct.<br /><br /><b>Salbutamol via pressurised metered-dose inhaler with spacer</b> is inappropriate in life-threatening asthma. Whilst pMDI with spacer is effective for moderate exacerbations and may be equivalent to nebulisers in acute severe asthma without life-threatening features, it is insufficient when life-threatening features are present. This patient's severe respiratory distress, silent chest, and hypoxaemia indicate the need for more aggressive bronchodilator delivery alongside oxygen therapy. The BTS specifically recommends nebulised therapy for life-threatening presentations.<br /><br /><b>Nebulised salbutamol in air</b> would be suboptimal management. Whilst the nebulised route is appropriate for life-threatening asthma, delivering it in air rather than oxygen fails to address this patient's significant hypoxaemia (SpO\u2082 88%). In life-threatening asthma with hypoxaemia, oxygen should be used as the driving gas for nebulisation, allowing simultaneous correction of hypoxia whilst delivering bronchodilator therapy. Air-driven nebulisers are reserved for patients at risk of hypercapnic respiratory failure, which is not the primary concern here.<br /><br /><b>Nebulised ipratropium bromide in oxygen</b> is an important adjunct in severe and life-threatening asthma but should not be used as first-line monotherapy. Short-acting beta-agonists like salbutamol provide more rapid and potent bronchodilation than anticholinergics. Ipratropium should be added to nebulised salbutamol in severe or life-threatening cases, or when initial beta-agonist therapy proves insufficient. Using ipratropium alone would delay the most effective bronchodilator treatment.<br /><br /><b>Intravenous salbutamol</b> is reserved for patients with life-threatening or near-fatal asthma who are deteriorating despite optimal inhaled therapy, or in situations where inhaled drug delivery is inadequate. It is not first-line management and requires senior critical care involvement due to potential adverse effects including tachycardia, arrhythmias, and hypokalaemia. This patient should first receive nebulised therapy, which is safer and usually effective when properly administered.",
