        "body": "Under normal conditions, clotting and clot breakdown are balanced. Thrombin converts fibrinogen into fibrin to form a stable clot, while the fibrinolytic system generates plasmin to break down fibrin and fibrinogen into fibrin degradation products. Plasmin is central to maintaining this balance.<br /><br />In disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC), this balance is lost, leading to widespread clotting and bleeding. The key trigger is tissue factor (TF), a membrane protein normally hidden from circulation but exposed after vascular injury or in response to cytokines (e.g. IL-1, TNF) and endotoxin, particularly in sepsis. TF is abundant in lung, brain, and placenta, explaining the risk in trauma and obstetric cases.

            "The <b>copper IUD</b> is the most appropriate option here, due to the likelihood that ovulation has already occurred (estimated as day 14, whereas now on day 17). It can be inserted as effective emergency contraception up to 5 days past the most likely ovulation date (typically day 14).

            "The correct answer is <b>Increased risk of ovarian cancer</b>. In fact, the use of combined oral contraceptive pill (COCP) has been associated with a reduced risk of ovarian cancer. The protective effect seems to increase with the duration of use and persists for many years after discontinuation. <br /><br />The option <b>Increased risk of deep vein thrombosis</b> is incorrect as COCP indeed increases the risk of venous thromboembolism including deep vein thrombosis. This is due to increased liver synthesis of procoagulant factors and decreased anticoagulant factors induced by oestrogen component.<br /><br />The option <b>Increased risk of breast cancer</b> is also incorrect. Studies have shown a small increase in relative risk of breast cancer among current and recent users of COCP. However, this appears to return to baseline approximately 10 years after discontinuation.<br /><br /><b>Increased risk of ischaemic heart disease</b> is an incorrect answer as well. The COCP can lead to an increased risk of ischaemic heart disease, especially in women who smoke or are over 35 years old. It's thought that this may be due to the effects on lipid metabolism and coagulation.<br /><br />Lastly, <b>Increased risk of cervical cancer</b> is also not the correct answer because there's evidence suggesting a slightly increased risk of cervical cancer in long-term users (>5years) of COCP, although it remains controversial whether this association is causal or related to sexual behaviour patterns.<br />",

The patient's symptoms of poor eyesight and blurred vision, combined with the findings on fundoscopy of drusen formation in both eyes, are characteristic of dry age-related macular degeneration (AMD).

Pre-proliferative diabetic retinopathy is characterized by multiple cotton wool spots, venous beading, and intraretinal microvascular abnormalities on fundoscopy.

It is more common with advancing age and is more common in females.<br /><br />Risk factors<br /><ul><li>advancing age itself is the greatest risk factor for ARMD<ul><li>the risk of ARMD increases 3 fold for patients aged older than 75 years, versus those aged 65-74.</li></ul></li><li><span class=\"concept\" data-cid=\"640\">smoking</span><ul><li>current smokers are twice as likely as non-smokers to have ARMD related visual loss, and ex-smokers have a slightly increased risk of developing the condition, (OR 1.13). </li></ul></li><li>family history is also a strong risk factor for developing ARMD<ul><li>first degree relatives of a sufferer of ARMD are thought to be four times more likely to inherit the condition.</li></ul></li><li>other risk factors for developing the condition include those associated with an increased risk of ischaemic cardiovascular disease, such as hypertension, dyslipidaemia and diabetes mellitus. </li></ul><br /><br /><h5 class='notes-heading'>Classification</h5><br />Traditionally two forms of macular degeneration are seen:<br /><ul><li>dry macular degeneration<ul><li>90% of cases</li><li>also known as atrophic</li><li>characterised by <span class=\"concept\" data-cid=\"639\">drusen</span>  - yellow round spots in Bruch's membrane</li></ul></li><li>wet macular degeneration<ul><li>10% of cases</li><li>also known as exudative or neovascular macular degeneration</li><li>characterised by <span class=\"concept\" data-cid=\"11900\">choroidal neovascularisation</span></li><li>leakage of serous fluid and blood can subsequently result in a rapid loss of vision</li><li>carries the worst prognosis</li></ul></li></ul><br />Recently there has been a move to a more updated classification:<br /><ul><li>early age-related macular degeneration (non-exudative, age-related maculopathy): drusen and alterations to the retinal pigment epithelium (RPE)</li><li>late age-related macular degeneration (neovascularisation, exudative)</li></ul><br /><h5 class='notes-heading'>Clinical features</h5><br />Patients typically present with a subacute onset of visual loss with:<br /><ul><li>a reduction in visual acuity, particularly for near field objects<ul><li>gradual in dry ARMD </li><li>subacute in wet ARMD</li></ul></li><li><span class=\"concept\" data-cid=\"12500\">worse in the centre of vision</span> (e.g. difficulty reading, recognising faces, driving)</li><li>difficulties in dark adaptation with an overall deterioration in vision at night</li><li>fluctuations in visual disturbance which may vary significantly from day to day</li><li>they may also suffer from photopsia, (a perception of flickering or flashing lights), and glare around objects</li><li>visual hallucinations may also occur resulting in Charles-Bonnet syndrome</li></ul><br />Signs:<br /><ul><li>distortion of line perception may be noted on <span class=\"concept\" data-cid=\"11392\">Amsler grid testing</span></li><li>fundoscopy reveals the presence of drusen, yellow areas of pigment deposition in the macular area, which may become confluent in late disease to form a macular scar.</li><li>in wet ARMD well demarcated red patches may be seen which represent intra-retinal or sub-retinal fluid leakage or haemorrhage. </li></ul>   <br />Investigations:<br /><ul><li>slit-lamp microscopy is the initial investigation of choice, to identify any pigmentary, exudative or haemorrhagic changes affecting the retina which may identify the presence of ARMD. This is usually accompanied by colour fundus photography to provide a baseline against which changes can be identified over time.</li><li>fluorescein angiography is utilised if neovascular ARMD is suspected, as this can guide intervention with anti-VEGF therapy. This may be complemented with indocyanine green angiography to visualise any changes in the choroidal circulation. </li><li>optical coherence tomography is used to visualise the retina in three dimensions because it can reveal areas of disease which aren't visible using microscopy alone. </li></ul><br /><h5 class='notes-heading'>Management</h5><br />Treatment<br /><ul><li>the AREDS trial examined the treatment of dry ARMD in 3640 subjects. It showed that a combination of zinc with anti-oxidant vitamins A,C and E reduced progression of the disease by around one third. Patients with more extensive drusen seemed to benefit most from the intervention. Treatment is therefore recommended in patients with at least moderate category dry ARMD. </li><li><span class=\"concept\" data-cid=\"4069\">vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF)</span> <ul><li>VEGR is a potent mitogen and drives increased vascular permeability in patients with wet ARMD</li><li>a number of trials have shown that use of anti-VEGF agents can limit progression of wet ARMD and stabilise or reverse visual loss</li><li>evidence suggests that they should be instituted within the first two months of diagnosis of wet ARMD if possible</li><li>examples of anti-VEGF agents include ranibizumab, <span class=\"concept\" data-cid=\"11448\">bevacizumab</span> and pegaptanib,. The agents are usually administered by 4 weekly injection. </li></ul></li><li>laser photocoagulation does slow progression of ARMD where there is new vessel formation, although there is a risk of acute visual loss after treatment, which may be increased in patients with sub-foveal ARMD. For this reason anti-VEGF therapies are usually preferred.</li></ul>",

            "The correct answer is <b>Gynaecomastia</b>. Finasteride, a 5-alpha reductase inhibitor, works by reducing the conversion of testosterone to dihydrotestosterone (DHT), which is more potent. This leads to a reduction in prostate size and can help alleviate symptoms of bladder outflow obstruction. However, this also results in an increase in oestrogen levels relative to androgens. The imbalance between testosterone and oestrogen can lead to gynaecomastia, or enlargement of male breast tissue.<br /><br /><b>Alopecia</b> is not typically an adverse effect of finasteride. In fact, it's quite the opposite - finasteride is often used as a treatment for male pattern baldness due to its ability to reduce DHT levels, which contributes to hair loss.<br /><br /><b>Prostate cancer</b> is also not associated with finasteride use as an adverse effect. Some studies have suggested that while finasteride may lower the overall risk of prostate cancer, it could potentially increase the risk of high-grade disease; however, this remains controversial and further research is needed.<br /><br /><b>Increased levels of serum prostate-specific antigen (PSA)</b> would be expected with prostate cancer or prostatitis but not with finasteride use. Actually, finasteride can cause a decrease in PSA levels by about 50%. Therefore, when using PSA to screen for prostate cancer in men taking finasteride, the PSA level should be doubled to avoid missing any potential cancers.<br /><br />Lastly, <b>Postural hypotension</b>, or a drop in blood pressure upon standing up from sitting or lying down position isn't typically associated with finasteride use either. This side effect is more commonly seen with alpha-blockers like tamsulosin or doxazosin which are also used in managing symptoms of bladder outflow obstruction due to benign prostatic hyperplasia but work via a different mechanism.<br />",
