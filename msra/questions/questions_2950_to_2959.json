            "<b>Azithromycin</b> is the correct answer. This patient presents with features highly suggestive of pertussis: paroxysmal cough with post-tussive vomiting, lasting 10 days, with transmission to her vulnerable newborn infant. The conjunctival injection may represent subconjunctival haemorrhage from severe coughing. Macrolide antibiotics (azithromycin, clarithromycin, or erythromycin) are indicated when the onset of cough is within the previous 21 days. Although antibiotics do not alter the clinical course for the patient, they are crucial for eradicating the organism and reducing transmission\u2014particularly important given her infant's infection. The infant should be urgently admitted as all infants under 6 months with suspected pertussis require hospital assessment due to risks of apnoea and severe complications. The mother should also be advised about school exclusion rules (48 hours after starting antibiotics) and the need for household contact prophylaxis.<br /><br /><b>Amoxicillin</b> is not appropriate for pertussis. Bordetella pertussis requires macrolide antibiotics for eradication. Amoxicillin, a beta-lactam antibiotic, lacks the necessary activity against this organism and would not reduce transmission or provide the recommended treatment for pertussis. This would be an inappropriate choice despite the patient being within the 21-day window for antibiotic therapy.<br /><br /><b>Doxycycline</b> is not first-line treatment for pertussis. Whilst tetracyclines have some activity against Bordetella pertussis, they are not recommended in UK guidelines. Macrolides remain the antibiotic class of choice. Additionally, doxycycline would be contraindicated if the mother were breastfeeding her infant, as tetracyclines can affect bone and tooth development in young children. The evidence base and safety profile support macrolide use over tetracyclines in this scenario.<br /><br /><b>Co-amoxiclav</b> is not indicated for pertussis treatment. Like amoxicillin alone, this beta-lactam combination does not provide adequate coverage against Bordetella pertussis. The addition of clavulanic acid does not improve activity against this organism. Co-amoxiclav would be more appropriate for bacterial respiratory tract infections caused by typical respiratory pathogens, but macrolides are specifically required for pertussis management and transmission control.<br /><br /><b>Supportive management only</b> would be inappropriate in this case. Although the patient is beyond the point where antibiotics would significantly alter her clinical course, treatment is still indicated within 21 days of cough onset to reduce transmission. This is particularly crucial given the vulnerable newborn infant who has developed symptoms. Failing to treat would perpetuate household transmission and potentially expose other vulnerable contacts. Notification to public health authorities and contact tracing are also important aspects of management that would be triggered by diagnosis and treatment.",

Following presentation, a ten-week 'watch and wait' period should follow to observe whether symptoms change or resolve. If they persist then referral to secondary care is required. This is normally to a paediatrician with a special interest in behavioural disorders, or to the local Child and Adolescent Mental Health Service (CAMHS). Here, the needs and wants of the patient, as well as how their condition affects their lives should be taken into account, to offer a tailored plan of action. <br /><br /><b>Drug therapy should be seen as a last resort</b> and is only available to those aged <b>5 years or more</b>.

Secondly, the character of the pain is highly suggestive. It is described as deep, boring, and severe enough to wake her from sleep. This is the classic description of scleritic pain, which helps to differentiate it from other causes of a red eye. The associated photophobia and reduction in vision are also consistent findings. Scleritis is a full-thickness inflammation of the sclera and is considered a sight-threatening condition that requires urgent, same-day referral to an ophthalmologist for assessment and management. Treatment typically involves systemic therapy, such as oral NSAIDs or corticosteroids, to control the inflammation.<br /><br /><b>Episcleritis</b> is an important differential diagnosis, as it is also associated with rheumatoid arthritis. However, it involves inflammation of the superficial episcleral tissues only. Consequently, the symptoms are much milder. Patients typically complain of mild discomfort, grittiness, or a dull ache rather than the severe, deep pain described in this scenario. The pain from episcleritis would be highly unlikely to wake a patient from sleep. Vision is characteristically unaffected in episcleritis. While both conditions cause a red eye, the severity of the pain is the key distinguishing feature in this history.<br /><br /><b>Anterior uveitis</b> is inflammation of the iris and ciliary body. It presents with a painful red eye, photophobia, and blurred vision. While it can be associated with systemic inflammatory diseases, the association with rheumatoid arthritis is less common than with seronegative spondyloarthropathies (e.g., ankylosing spondylitis). Although the symptoms overlap, the deep, boring nature of the pain is more characteristic of scleritis. Examination in anterior uveitis would typically reveal a ciliary flush (a ring of redness concentrated around the cornea) and signs such as keratic precipitates or an irregular pupil, which are not described here.<br /><br /><b>Acute angle-closure glaucoma</b> is an ophthalmological emergency characterised by a sudden, severe rise in intraocular pressure. It presents with a very painful red eye, but the pain is often accompanied by systemic symptoms such as headache, nausea, and vomiting. Patients may also report seeing haloes around lights. The history of a systemic inflammatory condition like rheumatoid arthritis makes an inflammatory cause more likely. Furthermore, the pain in glaucoma is not typically described as 'boring'. Examination would reveal a hazy cornea and a fixed, mid-dilated pupil.<br /><br /><b>Keratitis</b> refers to inflammation of the cornea. It can be associated with rheumatoid arthritis, particularly a form called peripheral ulcerative keratitis. It causes a painful red eye, photophobia, and reduced vision. However, the pain is often described as a sharp, foreign body sensation rather than a deep, boring ache. The diagnosis is made on slit-lamp examination, which would reveal a corneal opacity or ulcer, typically staining with fluorescein dye. The pain character in the stem makes scleritis a more probable diagnosis.",

            "<b>Intravenous glyceryl trinitrate</b> is the correct answer. This patient presents with acute decompensated heart failure, evidenced by acute breathlessness and bilateral basal crackles. The scenario is complicated by two key features: severe hypertension (190/110 mmHg) and concomitant myocardial ischaemia (central chest pain and widespread ST depression on ECG). According to UK guidelines (NICE), while vasodilators like nitrates are not routinely recommended for all patients with acute heart failure, they have a specific role in patients with a systolic blood pressure >100 mmHg who have concomitant myocardial ischaemia or severe hypertension. This patient meets both criteria. Intravenous glyceryl trinitrate (GTN) acts as a potent venodilator, reducing preload, and at higher doses, an arterial vasodilator, reducing afterload. This reduces myocardial oxygen demand, alleviates pulmonary congestion, and helps to control the severe hypertension, thereby treating both the heart failure and the ischaemia simultaneously. The initial management with furosemide and oxygen is appropriate, but adding GTN is the most critical next step to address the underlying pathophysiology in this specific presentation.<br /><br /><b>Intravenous morphine</b> is an incorrect option. Historically, opiates like morphine were commonly used in acute pulmonary oedema for their anxiolytic and potential vasodilatory effects. However, current NICE guidelines advise against their routine use. Observational studies have suggested a potential association between opiate administration in acute heart failure and adverse outcomes, including increased mortality and need for mechanical ventilation. While it may be considered for severe distress, it is not a primary therapeutic intervention, and in this case, GTN is clearly indicated to manage the haemodynamics and ischaemia, which will likely also relieve the patient's distress.<br /><br /><b>Intravenous dobutamine</b> is an incorrect and potentially harmful choice. Dobutamine is a positive inotrope used to increase cardiac contractility and cardiac output. Its use is reserved for patients with cardiogenic shock, which is characterised by hypotension (e.g., systolic BP <90 mmHg) and evidence of end-organ hypoperfusion. This patient is severely hypertensive, not hypotensive. Administering an inotrope like dobutamine would further increase myocardial oxygen demand, potentially worsening the ischaemia, and would be inappropriate given the high blood pressure. The primary problem here is excessive afterload and preload, not poor contractility in the context of hypotension.<br /><br /><b>Oral bisoprolol</b> is an incorrect option in this acute setting. Bisoprolol is a beta-blocker, which is a cornerstone of long-term management for chronic heart failure with reduced ejection fraction. While patients already established on beta-blockers should generally continue them during an acute admission (unless haemodynamically unstable), initiating a beta-blocker during an episode of acute decompensation is contraindicated. Beta-blockers have negative inotropic and chronotropic effects, which can worsen the acute heart failure and lead to cardiovascular collapse. They are typically started once the patient is euvolaemic and stable.<br /><br /><b>Continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP)</b> is a plausible but not the most appropriate next step. CPAP is an effective treatment for patients with acute cardiogenic pulmonary oedema who have severe respiratory distress or respiratory acidosis. It works by increasing intrathoracic pressure, which reduces preload and afterload, and by recruiting collapsed alveoli to improve oxygenation. While this patient is hypoxic (implied by the need for oxygen), the most pressing issues are the severe hypertension and myocardial ischaemia driving the pulmonary oedema. The most direct and appropriate intervention is to administer GTN to control blood pressure and relieve ischaemia. This will, in turn, improve the pulmonary oedema and respiratory status. CPAP would be considered if the patient's respiratory status fails to improve or deteriorates despite initial medical therapy.",

        "body": "NICE updated their guidelines on the management of atrial fibrillation (AF) in 2021. <br /><br /><h5 class='notes-heading'>Does the patient need anticoagulation?</h5><br />The need for anticoagulation should be considered in patients with any history of AF, not just if they are in AF currently, i.e. the following groups should be assessed:<br /><ul><li>symptomatic or asymptomatic <span class=\"concept\" data-cid=\"5358\">paroxysmal</span>, persistent or permanent atrial fibrillation</li><li>atrial flutter</li><li>a continuing risk of arrhythmia recurrence after cardioversion back to sinus rhythm or catheter ablation</li></ul><br />NICE suggest using the <span class=\"concept\" data-cid=\"4020\"><b>CHA<sub>2</sub>DS<sub>2</sub>-VASc</b></span> score to determine the most appropriate anticoagulation strategy. This scoring system superceded the CHADS<sub>2</sub> score.<br /><br /><div class=\"table-responsive\"><table class = \"tlarge table table-striped table-bordered\"  data-role=\"table\" id=\"tableid1\" ><thead><tr><th></th><th>Risk factor</th><th>Points</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td> <b>C</b></td><td>Congestive heart failure</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td> <b>H</b></td><td>Hypertension (or treated hypertension)</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td> <b>A<sub>2</sub></b></td><td>Age >= 75 years</td><td>2</td></tr><tr><td></td><td>Age 65-74 years</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td> <b>D</b></td><td>Diabetes</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td> <b>S<sub>2</sub></b></td><td>Prior Stroke, TIA or thromboembolism</td><td>2</td></tr><tr><td> <b>V</b></td><td>Vascular disease (including ischaemic heart disease and peripheral arterial disease)</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td><b>S</b></td><td>Sex (female)</td><td>1</td></tr></tbody></table></div><br />The table below shows a suggested <span class=\"concept\" data-cid=\"1686\">anticoagulation strategy based on the score</span>:<br /><br /><div class=\"table-responsive\"><table class = \"tlarge table table-striped table-bordered\"  data-role=\"table\" id=\"tableid2\" ><thead><tr><th>Score</th><th>Anticoagulation</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>0</td><td>No treatment</td></tr><tr><td>1</td><td>Males: Consider anticoagulation<br />Females: No treatment (this is because their score of 1 is only reached due to their gender)</td></tr><tr><td>2 or more</td><td>Offer anticoagulation</td></tr></tbody></table></div><br />Remember that if a CHA<sub>2</sub>DS<sub>2</sub>-VASc score suggests no need for anticoagulation it is important to ensure a <span class=\"concept\" data-cid=\"10904\">transthoracic echocardiogram has been done to exclude valvular heart disease</span>, which in combination with AF is an absolute indication for anticoagulation.<br /><br /><br /><h5 class='notes-heading'>Assessing bleeding risk</h5><br />Doctors have always thought carefully about the risk/benefit profile of starting someone on warfarin. A history of falls, old age, alcohol excess and a history of previous bleeding are common things that make us consider whether anticoagulation is in the best interests of the patient., but NICE warn us <span class=\"concept\" data-cid=\"5359\">not to withhold anticoagulation solely on the grounds of age or risk falls</span>. NICE now recommend we formalise this risk assessment using the <span class=\"concept\" data-cid=\"11422\">ORBIT scoring system</span>. Previously the HAS-BLED scoring system was recommended.<br /><br /><div class=\"table-responsive\"><table class = \"tlarge table table-striped table-bordered\"  data-role=\"table\" id=\"tableid3\" ><thead><tr><th>Variable</th><th>Points</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td><span class=\"concept\" data-cid=\"11423\">Haemoglobin</span> <130 g/L  for males and < 120 g/L for females, or haemtocrit < 40% for males and < 36% for females</td><td>2</td></tr><tr><td>Age > 74 years</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>Bleeding history (GI bleeding, intracranial bleeding or haemorrhagic stroke)</td><td>2</td></tr><tr><td><span class=\"concept\" data-cid=\"11423\">Renal impairment</span> (GFR < 60 mL/min/1.73m<sup>2</sup>)</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>Treatment with antiplatelet agents</td><td>1</td></tr></tbody></table></div><br />There are no formal rules on how we act on the ORBIT score and individual patient factors should be taken into account. However, the following table acts as a guide: <br /><br /><div class=\"table-responsive\"><table class = \"tlarge table table-striped table-bordered\"  data-role=\"table\" id=\"tableid4\" ><thead><tr><th>ORBIT score</th><th>Risk group</th><th>Bleeds per 100 patient-years</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>0-2</td><td>Low</td><td>2.4</td></tr><tr><td>3</td><td>Medium</td><td>4.7</td></tr><tr><td>4-7</td><td>High</td><td>8.1</td></tr></tbody></table></div><br /><br /><h5 class='notes-heading'>If treatment is indicated, which anticoagulant?</h5><br />For many years warfarin was the anticoagulant of choice in atrial fibrillation. This changed following the development of <span class=\"concept\" data-cid=\"3635\"><b>direct oral anticoagulants (DOACs)</b></span>. These have the advantage of not requiring regular blood tests to check the INR and now recommended as the first-line anticoagulant for patients with AF. If a patient was previously started on warfarin, NICE recommend discussing switching to a DOAC during a routine follow-up appointment.<br /><br />The following DOACs are recommended by NICE for reducing stroke risk in AF:<br /><ul><li>apixaban</li><li>dabigatran</li><li>edoxaban</li><li>rivaroxaban</li></ul><br />Warfarin is now used second-line, in patients where a DOAC is contraindicated or not tolerated.<br /><br />Aspirin is not recommended for reducing stroke risk in patients with AF.",

            "The correct answer is <b>Behcet's syndrome</b>. Behcet's syndrome, also known as Behcet's disease, is a rare and chronic condition that causes inflammation of the blood vessels (vasculitis) throughout the body. It can lead to numerous symptoms, including painful mouth sores, genital sores, and eye inflammation. Importantly for this question, it can increase the risk of venous thromboembolism due to the inflammation of the blood vessels. This inflammation can cause damage to the vessel walls leading to activation of the coagulation cascade and the formation of blood clots.<br /><br />The first incorrect option is <b>Reiter's syndrome</b>, now more commonly referred to as reactive arthritis. Reactive arthritis is a type of inflammatory arthritis that develops in response to an infection in another part of the body (cross-reactivity). While it may cause joint pain and swelling, it does not typically predispose individuals to venous thromboembolism.<br /><br />The second incorrect option is <b>Addison's disease</b>. Addison's disease is a disorder in which the adrenal glands do not produce enough hormones. Although this can cause a variety of symptoms such as fatigue, low blood pressure, weight loss and hyperpigmentation, there is no established association between Addison's disease and an increased risk of venous thromboembolism.<br /><br />The third incorrect option is <b>Hypothyroidism</b>. Hypothyroidism refers to any state in which thyroid hormone production is below normal. Individuals with hypothyroidism often experience fatigue, weight gain and cold intolerance among other symptoms; however, hypothyroidism does not directly increase the risk of venous thromboembolism.<br /><br />Lastly, <b>Penicillin</b> has been included as an incorrect option because it refers to a group of antibiotics widely used in medicine for treating bacterial infections caused by susceptible organisms. Penicillin does not have prothrombotic properties or contribute towards an increased risk of venous thromboembolism.<br />",

This inflammation can cause damage to the vessel walls leading to activation of the coagulation cascade and the formation of blood clots.<br /><br />The first incorrect option is <b>Reiter's syndrome</b>, now more commonly referred to as reactive arthritis. Reactive arthritis is a type of inflammatory arthritis that develops in response to an infection in another part of the body (cross-reactivity). While it may cause joint pain and swelling, it does not typically predispose individuals to venous thromboembolism.<br /><br />The second incorrect option is <b>Addison's disease</b>. Addison's disease is a disorder in which the adrenal glands do not produce enough hormones. Although this can cause a variety of symptoms such as fatigue, low blood pressure, weight loss and hyperpigmentation, there is no established association between Addison's disease and an increased risk of venous thromboembolism.<br /><br />The third incorrect option is <b>Hypothyroidism</b>. Hypothyroidism refers to any state in which thyroid hormone production is below normal. Individuals with hypothyroidism often experience fatigue, weight gain and cold intolerance among other symptoms; however, hypothyroidism does not directly increase the risk of venous thromboembolism.<br /><br />Lastly, <b>Penicillin</b> has been included as an incorrect option because it refers to a group of antibiotics widely used in medicine for treating bacterial infections caused by susceptible organisms. Penicillin does not have prothrombotic properties or contribute towards an increased risk of venous thromboembolism.<br />",
