            "<b>Tissue transglutaminase antibodies (TTG)</b> are the recommended first-line serological test for screening patients with suspected coeliac disease according to NICE guidelines. TTG antibodies have high sensitivity (around 93-97%) and specificity (around 95-99%) for coeliac disease, making them an excellent initial screening tool. These antibodies are produced when the immune system reacts to the tissue transglutaminase enzyme, which modifies gluten peptides in the small intestine, making them more immunogenic in susceptible individuals. TTG testing is widely available, relatively inexpensive, and has good reproducibility between laboratories. It's important to note that patients should be on a gluten-containing diet for at least 6 weeks prior to testing to avoid false negative results. If TTG is positive, further investigation with duodenal biopsy is required to confirm the diagnosis.<br /><br /><b>Anti-endomyseal antibodies</b> are highly specific for coeliac disease (specificity >99%) but are not recommended as the first-line test. They are more technically demanding, requiring indirect immunofluorescence on tissue substrates, making them more expensive and labour-intensive than TTG testing. Additionally, interpretation is subjective and requires experienced laboratory personnel. Anti-endomyseal antibody testing is typically used as a confirmatory test when TTG results are equivocal or to increase diagnostic certainty before proceeding to biopsy. Both TTG and endomyseal antibodies target the same antigen (tissue transglutaminase), but the testing methodologies differ.<br /><br /><b>HLA-DQ2/DQ8 genotyping</b> is not appropriate as a first-line screening test for coeliac disease. While approximately 95% of coeliac patients carry HLA-DQ2 and most of the remainder carry HLA-DQ8, these genetic markers are also present in about 30-40% of the general population, most of whom will never develop coeliac disease. The main value of HLA typing is its negative predictive value \u2013 if a patient is negative for both HLA-DQ2 and DQ8, coeliac disease is highly unlikely. Therefore, HLA typing is more useful for excluding coeliac disease in specific situations, such as in patients already on a gluten-free diet or in first-degree relatives of coeliac patients, rather than as an initial screening tool.<br /><br /><b>Anti-gliadin antibodies</b> are no longer recommended for coeliac disease screening due to their lower sensitivity and specificity compared to TTG and endomyseal antibodies. These were among the first antibodies identified in coeliac disease and target gliadin, a component of gluten. However, they can be elevated in various other gastrointestinal disorders and even in some healthy individuals, leading to false positive results. Newer generation tests for deamidated gliadin peptide antibodies have improved performance but are still not recommended as first-line tests by NICE guidelines. Anti-gliadin antibodies have largely been replaced by TTG and endomyseal antibody testing in clinical practice.<br /><br /><b>Duodenal biopsy</b> is considered the gold standard for diagnosing coeliac disease but is not appropriate as a first-line screening test. Biopsy is an invasive procedure requiring endoscopy, which carries risks and is more resource-intensive than serological testing. The typical histological findings in coeliac disease include villous atrophy, crypt hyperplasia, and increased intraepithelial lymphocytes. While biopsy is essential for confirming the diagnosis in patients with positive serology, it would be inappropriate and impractical to perform biopsies on all patients with suspected coeliac disease without first screening with serological tests. The recommended approach is to start with TTG antibody testing and proceed to biopsy for confirmation in those with positive or equivocal serological results.",

Both are positive for HBsAg (indicating infection) and negative for anti-HBs (as the infection has not been cleared).  <br /><br /><b>Immunity following previous infection</b> would be positive for anti-HBc IgG (as this remains indefinitely) and positive for anti-HBs (showing the body has cleared the virus previously). As the virus has been cleared, HBsAg is negative.  <br /><br /><b>Previous vaccination</b> would show positive anti-HBs (i.e. positive antibodies to the hepatitis B surface antigen) only, as this antibody has been introduced through vaccination. The body has never met the virus itself, so HBsAg would be negative (as there is no acute or chronic infection present) and there would be no anti-HBc (either IgG or IgM) as this is only formed through direct contact with the virus.<br /><br /><b> No previous contact with hepatitis B</b> would result in all of the serology tests being negative, indicating that the patient has never met the virus naturally and has never had anti-HBs introduced through vaccination.",

            "The correct answer in this scenario is a <b>Conversion disorder</b>. Conversion disorder, also known as functional neurological symptom disorder, is a psychiatric condition where psychological distress is expressed through physical symptoms. In this case, the patient's numb sensation below his knee and the sensory loss in a non-dermatomal distribution suggest that there may not be an identifiable organic cause for his symptoms. Instead, these symptoms could be manifestations of underlying psychological stress or anxiety related to his upcoming national athletics meeting.<br /><br />The first incorrect option is <b>Hypochondrial disorder</b>, now referred to as Illness Anxiety Disorder. This condition involves excessive worry about having a serious illness despite having no or only mild symptoms. The person may constantly seek medical reassurance and excessively research their perceived illness. In this case, the patient does not present with excessive worry about having an illness but rather reports an unusual sensation in his legs.<br /><br /><b>Somatisation disorder</b> is another incorrect option. This condition involves multiple unexplained physical symptoms across different body systems, causing significant distress and impairment in daily functioning. These symptoms cannot be explained by any medical condition or substance use. The patient in this scenario presents with isolated sensory loss below the knee, which does not fit the criteria for somatisation disorder.<br /><br />The next incorrect option is <b>Malingering</b>. Malingering refers to intentionally feigning or exaggerating physical or psychological symptoms for external gain (e.g., avoiding work or obtaining financial compensation). While it might be possible that the athlete could have secondary motives for presenting with these symptoms, there is no indication in the given information that he has any external gain from doing so.<br /><br />Finally, <b>Munchausen's syndrome</b>, now known as Factitious Disorder Imposed on Self, is also incorrect.

            "<b>Give oral activated charcoal</b> is the correct answer as the ingestion of aspirin happened less than one hour ago. Aspirin ingestion is considered an overdose when more than 125mg/kg has been consumed. This man has taken 30 tablets, each of which contains 300mg of aspirin. This means he has ingested 9 grams (or 9,000mg) of aspirin. As he weighs 62kg, he has consumed 145mg/kg of aspirin, therefore we can consider this an overdose. Giving activated charcoal should be done alongside an A to E approach. After an hour has passed, other management options would be more appropriate. It is likely too early for symptoms of aspirin overdose to be present. Early symptoms would include tinnitus, nausea, vomiting, and sweating. In severe cases, confusion, drowsiness and seizures may be present. <br /><br /><b>Begin haemodialysis</b> is incorrect. It has been less than an hour since ingestion, therefore activated charcoal is indicated. Haemodialysis would not be the first step before trying other management options. If he fulfilled the criteria for haemodialysis after an hour had passed, then this would be the best management option. The criteria include treatment-resistant metabolic acidosis, pulmonary oedema, seizures and coma in addition to others detailed in the notes section.<br /><br /><b>Do an ECG</b> is incorrect. This is an important initial investigation which should happen in the Emergency Department. It is unlikely to change the initial management and does not address the effects of the aspirin overdose. A blood gas should also be done. In the early stages, a blood gas might show respiratory alkalosis. The first hour is probably too early to show this and so this patient's blood gas might be normal. <br /><br /><b>Give IV sodium bicarbonate</b> is incorrect. This is used for urinary alkalinization, which increases the urinary elimination of the aspirin. This may be used as treatment if the time since ingestion has passed an hour. As it has been less than an hour since ingestion, activated charcoal is the first-line treatment.<br /><br /><b>Give prophylactic antiepileptics</b> is incorrect.

        "body": "Plasma potassium levels are regulated by a number of factors including aldosterone, acid-base balance and insulin levels. Metabolic acidosis is associated with hyperkalaemia as hydrogen and potassium ions compete with each other for exchange with sodium ions across cell membranes and in the distal tubule. ECG changes seen in hyperkalaemia include tall-tented T waves, small P waves, widened QRS leading to a sinusoidal pattern and asystole<br /><br />Causes of hyperkalaemia:<br /><ul><li><span class=\"concept\" data-cid=\"5045\">acute kidney injury</span></li><li>drugs*: potassium sparing diuretics, <span class=\"concept\" data-cid=\"7712\">ACE inhibitors</span>, <span class=\"concept\" data-cid=\"7713\">angiotensin 2 receptor blockers</span>, <span class=\"concept\" data-cid=\"7711\">spironolactone</span>, <span class=\"concept\" data-cid=\"7714\">ciclosporin</span>, <span class=\"concept\" data-cid=\"9809\">heparin</span>**</li><li><span class=\"concept\" data-cid=\"7715\">metabolic acidosis</span></li><li><span class=\"concept\" data-cid=\"7716\">Addison's disease</span></li><li><span class=\"concept\" data-cid=\"7717\">rhabdomyolysis</span></li><li><span class=\"concept\" data-cid=\"7718\">massive blood transfusion</span></li></ul><br />Foods that are high in potassium:<br /><ul><li>salt substitutes (i.e. Contain potassium rather than sodium)</li><li>bananas, oranges, kiwi fruit, avocado, spinach, tomatoes</li></ul><br />*beta-blockers interfere with potassium transport into cells and can potentially cause hyperkalaemia in renal failure patients - remember beta-agonists, e.g. Salbutamol, are sometimes used as emergency treatment<br /><br />**both unfractionated and low-molecular weight heparin can cause hyperkalaemia. This is thought to be caused by inhibition of aldosterone secretion",
