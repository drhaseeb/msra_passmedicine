Anticipation, in the context of genetic disorders such as Huntington's disease, refers to the phenomenon where the severity of the disorder and/or the age at which symptoms first appear tends to become worse or occur earlier with each new generation.

It is crucial that healthcare professionals provide appropriate counselling and support for these individuals.<br /><br /><b>Less severe disease in successive generations</b> is also incorrect.

            "The correct answer is <b>Reduced growth hormone levels</b>. In anorexia nervosa, growth hormone (GH) levels are typically elevated rather than reduced. This elevation occurs as a compensatory mechanism in response to the state of starvation and malnutrition. The body increases GH secretion to mobilise fat stores and maintain blood glucose levels during periods of nutritional deprivation. This represents a physiological adaptation to conserve energy and maintain essential metabolic functions during starvation. Despite elevated GH levels, patients with anorexia nervosa often have low insulin-like growth factor 1 (IGF-1) levels due to GH resistance in the liver, which is another adaptation to the malnourished state.<br /><br /><b>Hypokalaemia</b> is a recognised feature of anorexia nervosa. It can occur due to multiple mechanisms including poor dietary intake, renal potassium wasting (particularly in patients who purge through vomiting or laxative abuse), and shifts in potassium distribution related to refeeding. Hypokalaemia can lead to serious cardiac complications including arrhythmias and is an important parameter to monitor in these patients.<br /><br /><b>Low LH</b> (luteinising hormone) is a common finding in anorexia nervosa. The hypothalamic-pituitary-gonadal axis is suppressed in response to malnutrition and low body weight, resulting in reduced gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) pulsatility and consequently low LH levels. This contributes to the amenorrhoea or oligomenorrhoea frequently observed in female patients with anorexia nervosa.<br /><br /><b>Impaired glucose tolerance</b> is indeed a recognised feature of anorexia nervosa. Patients often display abnormal glucose metabolism, including delayed insulin secretion and impaired glucose tolerance. This occurs as an adaptive response to starvation, with the body attempting to preserve glucose for essential functions, particularly brain metabolism.<br /><br /><b>Low FSH</b> (follicle-stimulating hormone) occurs in anorexia nervosa for the same reason as low LH - suppression of the hypothalamic-pituitary-gonadal axis due to malnutrition. The reduced FSH levels contribute to impaired follicular development in females and reduced spermatogenesis in males with anorexia nervosa, resulting in reproductive dysfunction.<br /><br />In summary, while hypokalaemia, low LH, impaired glucose tolerance, and low FSH are all recognised features of anorexia nervosa, reduced growth hormone levels are not. Instead, growth hormone levels are typically elevated in this condition as part of the body's adaptive response to starvation.",
