            "The correct answer in this case is <b>laxative abuse</b>. Melanosis coli is a condition characterised by the presence of pigment-laden macrophages in the lamina propria of the colon. It is most commonly associated with chronic use or abuse of anthraquinone-containing laxatives, such as senna or cascara. The pigments are lipofuscin-like substances that accumulate within macrophages as a result of apoptosis and necrosis of colonic epithelial cells. Melanosis coli itself is generally considered to be a benign condition, but it can be an important clinical clue to underlying laxative abuse.<br /><br /><b>Intestinal melanoma</b> would not typically present with pigment-laden macrophages on biopsy. Instead, one would expect to see malignant melanocytes infiltrating the intestinal mucosa. Although metastatic melanoma can involve the gastrointestinal tract, primary intestinal melanomas are exceedingly rare.<br /><br /><b>Haemochromatosis</b> is a hereditary disorder characterised by excessive iron absorption and deposition in various organs, including the liver, pancreas, heart and joints. While it can cause various gastrointestinal symptoms (e.g., abdominal pain), it does not typically lead to pigment-laden macrophages in the colon.<br /><br /><b>Ulcerative colitis</b>, an inflammatory bowel disease affecting primarily the colon and rectum, would present with different histopathological findings than those described in this case. Biopsies from patients with ulcerative colitis typically show crypt abscesses, architectural distortion and infiltration of inflammatory cells (mainly neutrophils) into the mucosa and submucosa.<br /><br /><b>Colorectal cancer</b> would also have distinct histopathological features compared to melanosis coli.

            "<b>Turner's syndrome</b> is the correct answer. This woman has absent breast development (thelarche) and absent periods at the age of 16. Puberty is considered delayed when women have not begun thelarche by 13 or menarche by 15. These factors in addition to being of short stature raise suspicion of Turner's syndrome. Many patients with Turner's syndrome develop primary ovarian failure, as in this case where thelarche has not occurred and FSH and LH are at menopausal levels, with low oestradiol levels. FSH levels at menopause are \u226530 IU/L. Primary ovarian failure develops because the absence of a second normal X chromosome leads to the loss of follicles and therefore loss of normal oestrogen and progesterone production. Such females will require oestrogen (and later progesterone) therapy ideally at age 11-12 to maximise growth. Hyperprolactinaemia and hypo/hyperthyroidism can cause primary or secondary amenorrhoea, but levels are normal here. Hypothyroidism is associated with Turner's syndrome, so thyroid function should be checked. <br /><br /><b>Asherman's syndrome</b> is incorrect. This is a cause of secondary, not primary amenorrhoea. It occurs when intra-uterine adhesions form as a result of trauma due to dilatation and curettage for miscarriage or abortion or by endometrial ablation as a treatment for menorrhagia. <br /><br /><b>Constitutional delay</b> is incorrect. Though teenagers with constitutional delay can be short, due to delays in their growth spurt, this female has very high FSH and LH levels in the menopausal range, which would not be seen in constitutional delay. In addition, the constitutional delay is very rare in females compared to males. Constitutional delay tends to run in families, which is not the case here, though this is not always present. <br /><br /><b>Hypothalamic hypogonadism</b> is incorrect. Though also a cause of primary amenorrhoea, patients will have low FSH, LH and oestradiol levels due to low GnRH production by the hypothalamus. It is usually due to low weight, excess exercise and psychological factors. <br /><br /><b>Polycystic ovarian syndrome</b> is incorrect. Females with this condition will have normal thelarche but may have primary or secondary amenorrhoea or oligomenorrhoea.

            "Apixaban is the correct answer. The patient has a background of cancer and now VTE. NICE guideline suggests 6 months of DOAC. Evidence suggested that treatment with a direct-acting oral anticoagulant (DOAC) is less likely to result in bleeding complications than treatment with low molecular weight heparin (LMWH) and a vitamin K antagonist (VKA). Additionally, people taking a DOAC benefit by being able to have an oral treatment and avoid the frequent monitoring that is necessary with other types of anticoagulation treatment. Within the DOACs, there was evidence showing that apixaban is the most cost-effective option, because it results in the fewest bleeds. <br /><br />Warfarin is incorrect. Warfarin decreases blood clotting by blocking an enzyme called vitamin K epoxide reductase that reactivates vitamin K1. Without sufficient active vitamin K1, clotting factors II, VII, IX, and X have decreased clotting ability. To optimize the therapeutic effect without risking dangerous side effects such as bleeding, close monitoring of the degree of anticoagulation is required by a blood test measuring an INR which is not a convenient and cost-effective option. <br /><br />Heparin is incorrect. Heparin binds to the enzyme inhibitor antithrombin III (AT), causing a conformational change that results in its activation through an increase in the flexibility of its reactive site loop. Common side effects include bleeding, pain at the injection site, and low blood platelets. Serious side effects include heparin-induced thrombocytopenia. It is given subcutaneously which carries needle stick injury and is not nice to the patient! <br /><br />Low molecular weight patient is incorrect. LMWHs inhibit the coagulation process through binding to AT via a pentasaccharide sequence. This binding leads to a conformational change of AT which accelerates its inhibition of activated factor X (factor Xa). It is given subcutaneously and used as prophylaxis in hospital patients. Patients with reduced renal function should use heparin instead of LMWH.<br /><br />Aspirin is incorrect. It is an antiplatelet rather than an anticoagulant which will have no effect in resolving the clot. Aspirin given shortly after a myocardial infarction decreases the risk of death. Aspirin is also used long-term to help prevent further heart attacks, ischaemic strokes, and blood clots in people at high risk.",

The foetus has a small risk of these complications before 26 weeks.  The greatest risk is after 36 weeks gestation.

This includes anyone who has chickenpox, disseminated varicella-zoster, or immunocompromised patients with any form of zoster. <br /><br />If a pregnant woman displays any stigmata of chickenpox, you should promptly discuss with obstetrics and gynaecology for advice on further management. <br /><br />If a pregnant patient has had a chickenpox vaccine or has had chickenpox previously, they can be reassured as they are assumed to have immunity. <br /><br />If the patient is unsure of chickenpox exposure previously, they should be sent for varicella-zoster IgG levels.

This includes anyone who has chickenpox, disseminated varicella-zoster, or immunocompromised patients with any form of zoster. <br /><br />If a pregnant woman displays any stigmata of chickenpox, you should promptly discuss with obstetrics and gynaecology for advice on further management. <br /><br />If a pregnant patient has had a chickenpox vaccine or has had chickenpox previously, they can be reassured as they are assumed to have immunity. <br /><br />If the patient is unsure of chickenpox exposure previously, they should be sent for varicella-zoster IgG levels. If they are positive, you can reassure the patient that they are immune. If they are negative, discuss with obstetrics and gynaecology. If these results cannot be back within 48 hours of first exposure, you should discuss them with obstetrics for further advice.",

            "The correct answer is <b>Pain at night</b>. Ankylosing spondylitis (AS) is a type of inflammatory arthritis that primarily affects the spine. One of its hallmark features is nocturnal pain or pain that worsens during periods of rest, such as at night. This occurs due to increased inflammation when the body is at rest and can often improve with movement or exercise.<br /><br /><b>Rapid onset</b> is not typically associated with ankylosing spondylitis. AS usually has a slow and insidious onset, with symptoms gradually worsening over months to years. A rapid onset of back pain might suggest other conditions such as acute disc herniation or vertebral fracture.<br /><br /><b>Gets worse following exercise</b> is also not characteristic of AS. In fact, physical activity generally helps alleviate symptoms in patients with AS by reducing stiffness and maintaining flexibility. Pain that worsens following exercise may be indicative of mechanical back pain or injury.<br /><br /><b>Bone tenderness</b> would be unusual in ankylosing spondylitis. While there can be tenderness over entheses (where ligaments and tendons attach to bones), axial skeleton bone tenderness might suggest other diagnoses like malignancy, infection, or fracture.<br /><br />Lastly, <b>Improves with rest</b>, again, does not support a diagnosis of AS. Rest tends to exacerbate symptoms in individuals with this condition due to the inflammatory nature of the disease process which becomes more active during periods of inactivity. Conditions where back pain improves with rest could include mechanical causes such as muscle strain or degenerative disc disease.<br />",
