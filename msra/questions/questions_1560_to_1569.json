            "<b>Endotracheal tube with rapid sequence induction</b> is the most appropriate airway management for this patient. The scenario describes a non-fasted patient who has eaten within the last 2 hours and has a foreign body (chicken bone) lodged in her oesophagus. This creates a high risk of regurgitation and aspiration during anaesthesia. Rapid sequence induction (RSI) with endotracheal intubation provides the most secure airway protection against aspiration of gastric contents. The procedure involves pre-oxygenation, rapid administration of induction agent followed immediately by a neuromuscular blocking agent, application of cricoid pressure, and placement of an endotracheal tube with a cuffed balloon that creates a seal in the trachea. This technique minimises the time between loss of consciousness and securing the airway, reducing aspiration risk. The patient's BMI of 28 kg/m\u00b2 and stable vital signs make her a suitable candidate for RSI without anticipated difficult airway management.<br /><br /><b>Laryngeal mask airway with standard induction</b> would be inappropriate in this case. While LMAs are widely used in anaesthesia, they provide poor protection against regurgitation of gastric contents as they do not create a sealed barrier between the trachea and oesophagus. The Association of Anaesthetists guidelines advise against using LMAs in non-fasted patients precisely because of this aspiration risk. The patient has eaten within 90 minutes of presentation, well within the 6-hour fasting window recommended for solids, making an LMA unsuitable.<br /><br /><b>Facemask ventilation with propofol sedation</b> offers no protection against aspiration and would be dangerous in this scenario. Propofol sedation would depress the patient's protective airway reflexes without providing any barrier against regurgitation. Additionally, facemask ventilation might be challenging during an oesophageal procedure due to shared airway access with the endoscopist.<br /><br /><b>Awake fibreoptic intubation</b>, while providing excellent airway protection, would be unnecessarily invasive and uncomfortable for this patient. This technique is typically reserved for anticipated difficult airways where conventional laryngoscopy is likely to fail. There are no indications in the scenario (such as limited mouth opening, short neck, or previous difficult intubation) that would necessitate this approach over standard RSI.<br /><br /><b>Oropharyngeal airway with ketamine sedation</b> would be inadequate for this procedure. While ketamine preserves respiratory drive and airway reflexes better than other sedatives, it does not guarantee protection against aspiration. An oropharyngeal airway merely prevents the tongue from obstructing the airway but provides no barrier against regurgitation. Furthermore, this approach would likely provide insufficient depth of anaesthesia for a potentially stimulating oesophageal procedure.",

        "body": "Myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS) encompass a heterogeneous group of clonal hematopoietic stem cell disorders characterized by ineffective hematopoiesis, peripheral blood cytopenias, and a <span class=\"concept\" data-cid=\"2975\">risk of progression to acute myeloid leukaemia (AML)</span>. These disorders predominantly affect older adults, with a median age at diagnosis of 70-75 years.<br /><br /><b>Aetiology and Pathophysiology</b><br /><br />MDS arises from genetic mutations in hematopoietic stem cells. <br /><br />Around 90% of cases are primary with the remaining 10% secondary to causes such as chemotherapy and radiotherapy. <span class=\"concept\" data-cid=\"12069\">Secondary MDS typically develops around 5 years post-treatment</span>.<br /><br />The key pathophysiological feature of MDS is ineffective hematopoiesis leading to peripheral cytopenias despite a typically hypercellular bone marrow. The exact mechanisms are still not entirely understood, but they likely involve a combination of increased apoptosis, abnormal differentiation, and immune dysregulation.<br /><br /><b>Clinical Features</b><br /><br />MDS can present with various symptoms related to the underlying cytopenias. Common presentations include fatigue, weakness, and pallor due to anaemia; recurrent infections due to neutropenia; and easy bruising or bleeding due to thrombocytopenia. Some patients may be asymptomatic and are diagnosed incidentally on routine blood counts.<br /><br /><b>Diagnosis</b><br /><br />The diagnosis of MDS is based on peripheral blood counts, bone marrow examination, and cytogenetic analysis. Bone marrow biopsy typically shows dysplastic changes in hematopoietic cells and a varying degree of blasts. Cytogenetic analysis can identify specific chromosomal abnormalities that may have prognostic implications.<br /><br /><b>Treatment</b><br /><br />Treatment of MDS depends on the subtype of MDS, the patient's age and overall health, and the severity of symptoms. Options include supportive care (e.g., blood transfusions, growth factors), disease-modifying therapy (e.g., hypomethylating agents, lenalidomide), immunosuppressive therapy, and hematopoietic stem cell transplantation. The latter is the only potentially curative option but is limited by the patient's age and comorbidities.",

        "body": "NICE published updated guidelines for the management of hypertension in 2019. This builds on the significant guidelines released in 2011 that recommended:<br /><ul><li>classifying hypertension into stages</li><li>recommending the use of <span class=\"concept\" data-cid=\"547\">ambulatory blood pressure monitoring (ABPM)</span> and home blood pressure monitoring (HBPM)</li></ul><br /><br /><CENTER><table><tr><td align = 'left' colspan='2'><a data-fancybox class='fancybox' rel='group' href='https://d32xxyeh8kfs8k.cloudfront.net/images_Passmedicine/pdd927b.png'><img class='ajaximage' src='https://d32xxyeh8kfs8k.cloudfront.net/images_Passmedicine/pdd927.png'/></a></td></tr><tr><td valign='top' align='left'></td><td align='right'><a data-fancybox class='fancybox lbmagglasslink' rel='group' href='https://d32xxyeh8kfs8k.cloudfront.net/images_Passmedicine/pdd927b.png'><img src='https://d32xxyeh8kfs8k.cloudfront.net/css/images/mag_glass.png'/></a></td></tr></table></CENTER><div class='imagetext'>Flow chart showing simplified schematic for diagnosis hypertension following NICE guidelines</div><br /><br /><h5 class='notes-heading'>Why were these guidelines needed?</h5><br />It has long been recognised by doctors that there is a subgroup of patients whose blood pressure climbs 20 mmHg whenever they enter a clinical setting, so called 'white coat hypertension'. If we just rely on clinic readings then such patients may be diagnosed as having hypertension when, the vast majority of the time, their blood pressure is normal.<br /><br />This has led to the use of both ambulatory blood pressure monitoring (ABPM) and home blood pressure monitoring (HBPM) to confirm the diagnosis of hypertension. These techniques allow a more accurate assessment of a patients' overall blood pressure. Not only does this help prevent overdiagnosis of hypertension - ABPM has been shown to be a more accurate predictor of cardiovascular events than clinic readings.<br /><br /><h5 class='notes-heading'>Blood pressure classification</h5><br />This becomes relevant later in some of the management decisions that NICE advocate.<br /><br /><div class=\"table-responsive\"><table class = \"tlarge table table-striped table-bordered\"  data-role=\"table\" id=\"tableid1\" ><thead><tr><th><b>Stage</b></th><th><b>Criteria</b></th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td><b>Stage 1 hypertension</b></td><td>Clinic BP >= 140/90 mmHg and subsequent ABPM daytime average or HBPM average BP >= 135/85 mmHg</td></tr><tr><td><b>Stage 2 hypertension</b></td><td>Clinic BP >= 160/100 mmHg and subsequent ABPM daytime average or HBPM average BP >= 150/95 mmHg</td></tr><tr><td><b>Severe hypertension</b></td><td>Clinic systolic BP >= 180 mmHg, or clinic diastolic BP >= 120 mmHg</td></tr></tbody></table></div><br /><h5 class='notes-heading'>Diagnosing hypertension</h5><br />Firstly, NICE recommend measuring blood pressure in both arms when considering a diagnosis of hypertension. <br /><br />If the difference in readings between arms is more than 20 mmHg then the measurements should be repeated. If the difference remains > 20 mmHg then subsequent blood pressures should be recorded from the arm with the higher reading.<br /><br />It should of course be remember that there are pathological causes of unequal blood pressure readings from the arms, such as supravalvular aortic stenosis. It is therefore prudent to listen to the heart sounds if a difference exists and further investigation if a very large difference is noted.<br /><br />NICE also recommend taking a second reading during the consultation, if the first reading is > 140/90 mmHg. The lower reading of the two should determine further management.<br /><br />NICE suggest offering ABPM or HBPM to any patient with a blood pressure >= 140/90 mmHg.<br /><br />If the blood pressure is >= 180/120 mmHg:<br /><ul><li>admit for specialist assessment if:<ul><li><span class=\"concept\" data-cid=\"10965\">signs of retinal haemorrhage or papilloedema (accelerated hypertension)</span> or</li><li>life-threatening symptoms such as <span class=\"concept\" data-cid=\"10966\">new-onset confusion, chest pain, signs of heart failure, or acute kidney injury</span></li></ul></li><li>NICE also recommend referral if a phaeochromocytoma is suspected (labile or postural hypotension, headache, palpitations, pallor and diaphoresis)</li><li>if none of the above then arrange <span class=\"concept\" data-cid=\"10967\">urgent investigations for end-organ damage</span> (e.g. bloods, urine ACR, ECG)<ul><li>if target organ damage is identified, consider starting antihypertensive drug treatment immediately, without waiting for the results of ABPM or HBPM.</li><li>if no target organ damage is identified, repeat clinic blood pressure measurement within 7 days</li></ul></li></ul><br />Ambulatory blood pressure monitoring (ABPM)<br /><ul><li>at least 2 measurements per hour during the person's usual waking hours (for example, between 08:00 and 22:00)</li><li>use the average value of at least 14 measurements</li></ul><br />If ABPM is not tolerated or declined HBPM should be offered.<br /><br />Home blood pressure monitoring (HBPM)<br /><ul><li>for each BP recording, two consecutive measurements need to be taken, at least 1 minute apart and with the person seated</li><li>BP should be recorded twice daily, ideally in the morning and evening</li><li>BP should be recorded for at least 4 days, ideally for 7 days</li><li>discard the measurements taken on the first day and use the average value of all the remaining measurements</li></ul><br /><h5 class='notes-heading'>Interpreting the results</h5><br />ABPM/HBPM >= 135/85 mmHg (i.e. stage 1 hypertension)<br /><ul><li>treat if < 80 years of age AND any of the following apply; target organ damage, established cardiovascular disease, renal disease, diabetes or a 10-year cardiovascular risk equivalent to 10% or greater</li><li>in 2019, NICE made a further recommendation, suggesting that we should <i>'consider antihypertensive drug treatment in addition to lifestyle advice for adults aged under 60 with stage 1 hypertension and an estimated 10-year risk below 10%.

This seems to be due to evidence that QRISK may underestimate the lifetime probability of developing cardiovascular disease</li></ul><br />ABPM/HBPM >= 150/95 mmHg (i.e. stage 2 hypertension)<br /><ul><li>offer drug treatment regardless of age</li></ul><br /><div class=\"container\"><div class=\"row\"><div class=\"col-md-3\"><a href=\"https://d32xxyeh8kfs8k.cloudfront.net/images_Passmedicine/pdd973b.png\" data-fancybox=\"gallery\" data-caption=\"\"><img  class=\"img-thumbnail mx-auto d-block\" style=\"max-height:150px;margin-bottom:10px;\" src=\"https://d32xxyeh8kfs8k.cloudfront.net/images_Passmedicine/pdd973.png\" alt=\"\" /></a></div></div></div>",

            "The correct answer is <b>Lichen planus</b>. Lichen planus is a non-infectious, inflammatory condition that affects the skin and mucous membranes. The characteristic features include pruritic, polygonal, purple papules with reticulated white lines on their surface known as Wickham's striae. It can affect any part of the body but commonly involves the wrists, lower back, ankles and genitals. It can also occur at sites of previous skin injury - a phenomenon known as Koebner's response which explains the rash around the recent scar.<br /><br /><b>Scabies</b> is caused by infestation with the mite <i>Sarcoptes scabiei</i>. It typically presents with intense itching that is worse at night along with erythematous papules and burrows in web spaces of hands, wrists and genitals. However, it does not produce Wickham's striae or have a predilection for areas of previous skin trauma.<br /><br /><b>Lichen sclerosus</b> predominantly affects post-menopausal women although it can occur in men and children. In men, it presents as porcelain-white atrophic patches on the glans penis and foreskin which may cause phimosis. It doesn't involve palms or form Wickham's striae.<br /><br /><b>Morphea</b>, or localized scleroderma, usually presents as single or multiple hardened plaques on the skin that are initially erythematous or violaceous and then turn yellowish or ivory coloured. It doesn't typically cause itching nor present with Wickham's striae.<br /><br />Lastly, <b>Pityriasis rosea</b> is a self-limiting rash thought to be viral in origin. The initial presentation is often a single pink or red oval 'herald patch', followed by the development of smaller similar lesions arranged along skin cleavage lines creating a 'Christmas tree' pattern on the trunk. This condition does not typically involve palms or genitals nor present with Wickham's striae.<br />",

        "body": "Degenerative cervical myelopathy (DCM) has a number of risk factors, which include smoking due to its effects on the intervertebral discs, genetics and occupation - those exposing patients to high axial loading [1]. <br /><br />The presentation of DCM is very variable. Early symptoms are often subtle and can vary in severity day to day, making the disease difficult to detect initially. However as a progressive condition, worsening, deteriorating or new symptoms should be a warning sign.<br /><br />DCM symptoms can include any combination of [1]: <br /><ul><li>Pain (affecting the neck, upper or lower limbs)</li><li>Loss of motor function (loss of digital dexterity, preventing simple tasks such as holding a fork or doing up their shirt buttons, arm or leg weakness/stiffness leading to impaired gait and imbalance</li><li>Loss of sensory function causing numbness</li><li>Loss of autonomic function (urinary or faecal incontinence and/or impotence) - these can occur and do not necessarily suggest cauda equina syndrome in the absence of other hallmarks of that condition</li><li>Hoffman's sign: is a reflex test to assess for cervical myelopathy. It is performed by gently flicking one finger on a patient's hand. A positive test results in reflex twitching of the other fingers on the same hand in response to the flick. </li></ul><br />The most common symptoms at presentation of DCM are unknown, but in one series 50% of patients were initially incorrectly diagnosed and sometimes treated for carpal tunnel syndrome [2].<br /><br />An MRI of the cervical spine is the gold standard test where cervical myelopathy is suspected. It may reveal disc degeneration and ligament hypertrophy, with accompanying cord signal change.<br /><br />All patients with degenerative cervical myelopathy should be urgently referred for assessment by specialist spinal services (neurosurgery or orthopaedic spinal surgery). This is due to the importance of early treatment. The timing of surgery is important, as any existing spinal cord damage can be permanent. Early treatment (within 6 months of diagnosis) offers the best chance of a full recovery but at present, most patients are presenting too late. In one study, patients averaged over 5 appointments before diagnosis, representing >2 years. <br /><br />Currently, decompressive surgery is the only effective treatment. It has been shown to prevent disease progression. Close observation is an option for mild stable disease, but anything progressive or more severe requires surgery to prevent further deterioration. Physiotherapy should only be initiated by specialist services, as manipulation can cause more spinal cord damage. <br /><br />References<br />1. Baron EM, Young WF.

On fluorescein examination, it shows uptake on the cornea.<br /><br />What is the first-line treatment for this patient's condition?",
        "correct_answer": "1",
        "question_notes": "The most likely diagnosis in this patient is corneal abrasion. It is essential that you use fluorescein to determine if the corneal epithelium is intact. Topical antibiotic such as chloramphenicol ointment is recommended for these patients in order to prevent bacterial superinfection. <br /><br />Topical lubricant can be used but it isn't the first-line treatment.<br /><br />Topical anaesthesia can temporarily relieve the pain but it risks further corneal abrasion since the cornea loses sensation. It is not given as a treatment.<br /><br />Topical steroid is not used to treat corneal abrasion. <br /><br />You will not just watch and wait for a corneal abrasion.",
