            "The correct answer is <b>Metoclopramide</b>. This is because metoclopramide is a dopamine antagonist which can worsen Parkinson's disease by blocking dopamine receptors in the basal ganglia. The patient is already taking co-careldopa, which works by increasing dopamine levels to treat Parkinson's disease. Using metoclopramide would directly oppose this therapeutic effect and could lead to deterioration in the patient's parkinsonian symptoms. Additionally, metoclopramide can cause extrapyramidal side effects even in patients without Parkinson's disease, making it particularly hazardous in this case.<br /><br /><b>Ranitidine</b> would have been a suitable option for treating GORD, though it is currently withdrawn from the market due to NDMA contamination concerns. As an H2-receptor antagonist, it does not interact with the patient's existing medications and would not affect his Parkinson's disease.<br /><br /><b>Cyclizine</b>, while primarily an antiemetic, would not be the first-line choice for GORD but would be safe to use in this patient. As an antihistamine, it does not significantly affect dopaminergic pathways and can be used safely alongside the patient's current medications.<br /><br /><b>Lansoprazole</b> is a proton pump inhibitor (PPI) and would be an appropriate first-line treatment for GORD according to NICE guidelines.

The patient was started on amitriptyline 4 months ago, and his urinary symptoms began 1 month later. Amitriptyline is a tricyclic antidepressant (TCA) commonly used at low doses for neuropathic pain, as in this case for diabetic neuropathy. TCAs have significant anticholinergic (antimuscarinic) effects, which can cause urinary retention by inhibiting detrusor muscle contraction. This leads to symptoms of hesitancy, incomplete emptying, and overflow incontinence (manifesting as post-void dribbling).

            "The correct answer is <b>Inhibits ovulation</b>. Cerazette (desogestrel) primarily works by inhibiting ovulation. It does this by suppressing the mid-cycle surge of luteinising hormone (LH) and follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH), which are essential for the maturation and release of the egg from the ovary. This is its main mechanism of action, and it is highly effective at preventing pregnancy when taken correctly.<br /><br />The option <b>Thickens cervical mucous</b> is partially correct. While desogestrel does increase the viscosity of cervical mucus, making it more difficult for sperm to penetrate into the uterus, this is a secondary mechanism of action. It contributes to contraceptive efficacy but is not the primary way in which desogestrel prevents pregnancy.<br /><br /><b>Causes endometrial thinning</b> is another option that reflects a secondary effect of desogestrel. By altering the hormonal environment, desogestrel can lead to a thinner, less hospitable endometrium, which may theoretically impair implantation. However, this effect alone would not be sufficient to reliably prevent pregnancy.<br /><br /><b>Inhibits implantation</b> is incorrect because it suggests that desogestrel primarily acts as an abortifacient (a substance that induces abortion). While changes in endometrial receptivity may occur due to hormonal alterations caused by desogestrel, there is no evidence that these changes are significant enough to prevent implantation consistently.<br /><br />Lastly, <b>Toxic to sperm</b> is incorrect as well. Desogestrel does not have any direct toxic effects on sperm. Its contraceptive effects are mediated through its actions on ovulation and cervical mucus consistency rather than any direct impact on sperm function or viability.<br />",

            "The correct answer is the <b>Rectum</b>. Ulcerative colitis (UC) is an inflammatory bowel disease that primarily affects the mucosa and submucosa of the colon. It typically presents with bloody diarrhoea, abdominal pain, and systemic symptoms such as fever, fatigue, and weight loss. The rectum is the most commonly affected site in UC, with inflammation usually starting at the rectum and extending proximally in a continuous manner throughout the colon. In some cases, it may involve only the rectum (proctitis) or extend to involve other parts of the colon.<br /><br />The <b>Sigmoid colon</b> is an incorrect answer because although UC can affect this part of the bowel, it would not be considered as the most likely site for initial involvement. Inflammation in UC characteristically starts from the rectum and extends proximally; therefore, isolated sigmoid involvement without rectal inflammation would be atypical.<br /><br />The <b>Ascending colon</b> is also an incorrect answer. While UC can eventually involve this part of the bowel in more extensive disease (pancolitis), it does not typically begin here. The ascending colon is more commonly affected in Crohn's disease, another type of inflammatory bowel disease that can present with similar symptoms but has different pathophysiology and distribution patterns.<br /><br />The <b>Descending colon</b> is an incorrect choice as well. Although UC can extend to involve this region, it still originates from the rectum. Involvement of only descending colon without affecting rectum would be unusual for ulcerative colitis.<br /><br />Lastly, <b>Terminal ileum</b> is an incorrect option because it is not a common site for ulcerative colitis involvement. The terminal ileum is more frequently involved in Crohn's disease rather than UC. However, in rare cases called 'backwash ileitis,' there might be inflammation in the terminal ileum in patients with extensive UC (pancolitis) due to reflux of colonic contents into the ileum.",
