            "<b>Calf ultrasound</b> is the correct answer. This patient's presentation is consistent with Achilles tendon rupture, most commonly occurring in young individuals playing sports. Patients with Achilles tendon rupture are unable to plantarflex the ankle. A positive Thompson's test is pathognomonic for Achilles tendon rupture; the patient lies prone and the calf muscle belly is squeezed. The test is positive if the squeezing of the calf does not cause plantarflexion of the calf.<br /><br />Notably, fluoroquinolone antibiotics such as ciprofloxacin greatly increase the risk of Achilles tendon rupture due to inhibition of matrix metalloproteinase enzymes. This patient's recent course of ciprofloxacin should raise suspicion of tendinopathy. <br /><br />Calf ultrasound is the most appropriate first-line investigation to confirm the diagnosis of Achilles tendon rupture due to its high sensitivity and widespread availability.<br /><br /><b>Ankle x-ray</b> is incorrect. This patient's clinical features are suggestive of Achilles tendon rupture rather than bony injury. Soft tissue structures such as the Achilles tendon are not well visualised on x-ray imaging.<br /><br /><b>Calf CT</b> is incorrect. Soft tissue structures may not be well visualised on CT imaging and this would expose the patient to unnecessary radiation.<br /><br /><b>MRI calf</b> is incorrect. Although this would confirm the diagnosis of Achilles tendon rupture, ultrasound is a more rapid and inexpensive first-line investigation.<br /><br /><b>Venous duplex ultrasound</b> is incorrect. Venous duplex ultrasound may be used to confirm the diagnosis of a venous thrombus, rather than Achilles tendon rupture. Although both conditions may present acutely with a painful swollen calf, the patient's traumatic mechanism of injury is more suggestive of tendinous injury than thrombosis.",

One hundred and seventy patients are enrolled for the study with 120 receiving the new drug in addition to aspirin and the remainder receiving just aspirin.

However, it is not appropriate as an initial investigation for postmenopausal bleeding. MRI would be requested after tissue diagnosis has been obtained and is used to guide surgical planning and determine the extent of disease rather than as a screening or initial diagnostic tool.<br /><br /><b>CA-125 blood test</b> is a tumour marker primarily associated with ovarian cancer rather than endometrial cancer. While CA-125 may be elevated in some cases of endometrial cancer, particularly advanced disease, it has no role in the initial investigation of postmenopausal bleeding. It lacks both sensitivity and specificity for endometrial pathology and would not change management in this clinical scenario where structural imaging and tissue diagnosis are required.",

The primary symptom includes hypopigmented or hyperpigmented macules and patches on the chest and back. These patches may be pink, tan, brown or white, and they often become more noticeable with tanning, as in this case. In addition, these lesions can sometimes be slightly scaly.<br /><br /><b>Tinea corporis</b>, also known as ringworm, is a fungal infection that can cause red or silver ring-shaped rashes. The rash of tinea corporis is typically itchy and inflamed with a clear centre, which distinguishes it from pityriasis versicolor. Furthermore, tinea corporis usually presents as isolated lesions rather than multiple ones.<br /><br /><b>Porphyria cutanea tarda</b> results from deficiency of uroporphyrinogen decarboxylase leading to accumulation of porphyrins in the liver and skin. It manifests with photosensitivity causing blisters on sun-exposed areas like hands and face. Hypopigmentation isn't a typical feature.<br /><br /><b>Lyme disease</b>, caused by the bacterium <i>Borrelia burgdorferi</i>, typically presents with erythema migrans - a circular red rash that spreads outwards from the tick bite site - not hypopigmented lesions. Other systemic symptoms such as fever, fatigue and headache are usually present too.<br /><br />Finally, <b>psoriasis</b> is an autoimmune condition characterised by well-demarcated erythematous plaques covered with silvery scales.
