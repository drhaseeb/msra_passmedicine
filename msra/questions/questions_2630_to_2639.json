            "The correct answer is the <b>Alpha-adrenergic blocker</b>. Alpha-adrenergic blockers like tamsulosin are beneficial in this scenario as they can help facilitate stone passage. They work by relaxing the smooth muscle in the walls of the ureter, thereby allowing the stone to pass more easily. This is particularly relevant for stones that are 5-10mm in size, such as the one described in this case.<br /><br /><b>Nitrate</b> is incorrect because although it can cause smooth muscle relaxation, it's primarily used for angina management rather than facilitating kidney stone passage. Its vasodilatory effects on blood vessels wouldn't significantly impact ureteral stone passage.<br /><br />The use of a <b>Benzodiazepine</b> would not be beneficial in this scenario. Benzodiazepines are primarily used for their anxiolytic, hypnotic and muscle relaxant properties. While they do have muscle relaxant effects, these are not specific to the ureter and thus would not aid in stone passage.<br /><br />A <b>Beta-blocker</b> would also not be helpful here. Beta-blockers inhibit beta-adrenergic receptors which mainly results in decreased heart rate and blood pressure. They do not have any specific role or benefit in managing renal colic or promoting stone passage.<br /><br />Finally, <b>Corticosteroids</b> are also incorrect. These drugs reduce inflammation and modulate immune response but don't directly aid in kidney stone removal or pain relief associated with renal colic. Their side effect profile also makes them unsuitable for routine use in uncomplicated cases of kidney stones.<br />",

The toxins are rendered harmless (detoxified) and used as antigens in the vaccine. When the immune system encounters these non-toxic toxoids, it learns to combat the natural toxins the bacteria produce, providing immunity against the toxic effects of infections</li><li>toxoid vaccines often require booster doses to maintain immunity since, like inactivated vaccines, the immune response they induce can wane over time</li><li>examples:<ul><li><span class=\"concept\" data-cid=\"6352\">tetanus</span></li><li><span class=\"concept\" data-cid=\"6353\">diphtheria</span></li><li><span class=\"concept\" data-cid=\"6354\">pertussis</span></li></ul></li></ul><br />Subunit and conjugate vaccines are often grouped together. Subunit means that only part of the pathogen is used to generate an immunogenic response. A conjugate vaccine is a particular type that links the poorly immunogenic bacterial polysaccharide outer coats to proteins to make them more immunogenic<br /><ul><li><span class=\"concept\" data-cid=\"6357\">pneumococcus</span> (conjugate)</li><li><span class=\"concept\" data-cid=\"6358\">haemophilus</span> (conjugate)</li><li><span class=\"concept\" data-cid=\"6356\">meningococcus</span> (conjugate)</li><li><span class=\"concept\" data-cid=\"6355\">hepatitis B</span></li><li><span class=\"concept\" data-cid=\"6362\">human papillomavirus</span> </li></ul>,<br />Messenger RNA (mRNA)<br /><ul><li>introduce a piece of mRNA into cells which then produce a protein to trigger an immune response.</li><li>examples: some COVID-19 vaccines</li></ul><br />Viral vector vaccines:<br /><ul><li>use a harmless virus (different from the target pathogen) to deliver critical parts of the target pathogen to stimulate an immune response</li><li>can be produced more rapidly in response to emerging threats</li><li>examples: some Ebola and COVID-19 vaccines</li></ul><br />Notes<br /><ul><li>influenza: different types are available, including whole inactivated virus, split virion (virus particles disrupted by detergent treatment) and sub-unit (mainly haemagglutinin and neuraminidase)</li><li>cholera: contains inactivated Inaba and Ogawa strains of Vibrio cholerae together with recombinant B-subunit of the cholera toxin</li><li>hepatitis B: contains HBsAg adsorbed onto aluminium hydroxide adjuvant and is prepared from yeast cells using recombinant DNA technology</li></ul><br /><h5 class='notes-heading'>Valency of vaccines</h5><br />The term 'valency' in vaccinology denotes the <span class=\"concept\" data-cid=\"12099\">number of distinct antigenic components or serotypes a vaccine can protect against</span>.

            "<b>Sertraline</b> is the correct answer. According to NICE guidelines (CG113) for Generalised Anxiety Disorder (GAD), management follows a stepped-care model. This patient has already engaged with step 2 (low-intensity psychological interventions - guided self-help) without success, so he is now at step 3. At this stage, treatment options include either high-intensity psychological interventions (like CBT) or drug treatment. The patient has expressed a preference for medication. NICE specifically recommends sertraline as the first-line Selective Serotonin Reuptake Inhibitor (SSRI) for GAD. It has a favourable balance of efficacy and tolerability. The patient should be counselled about the potential for an initial increase in anxiety and the delayed onset of therapeutic effect, which can take several weeks. Regular follow-up is essential, particularly in the first month.<br /><br /><b>Citalopram</b> is another SSRI that can be used to treat anxiety disorders. However, NICE guidance for GAD specifically names sertraline as the preferred first-line agent. Other SSRIs, such as citalopram or escitalopram, or a Serotonin-Noradrenaline Reuptake Inhibitor (SNRI), would typically be considered second-line if sertraline proves to be ineffective or is not tolerated by the patient. Therefore, while a plausible option, it is not the single most appropriate initial choice.<br /><br /><b>Diazepam</b> is a benzodiazepine. While effective for the rapid relief of anxiety symptoms, its use in GAD is strongly discouraged by NICE for long-term management. Benzodiazepines are associated with a high risk of tolerance, dependence, and significant withdrawal symptoms. Their use should be reserved for short-term management of severe, disabling anxiety during a crisis, and for no longer than 2-4 weeks. Starting it as a first-line, long-term treatment for this patient would be inappropriate.<br /><br /><b>Pregabalin</b> is an anticonvulsant medication that is also licensed for the treatment of GAD. However, it is considered a third-line option by NICE. It should only be offered if the patient has not responded to or cannot tolerate SSRIs and SNRIs. Its side effect profile includes dizziness and somnolence, and there are growing concerns about its potential for misuse and dependence. Therefore, it is not an appropriate initial medication.<br /><br /><b>Venlafaxine</b> is a Serotonin-Noradrenaline Reuptake Inhibitor (SNRI). SNRIs are considered a second-line pharmacological option for GAD according to NICE guidelines. They are typically offered if a patient has not responded to an adequate trial of a first-line SSRI like sertraline. Starting with venlafaxine would deviate from the recommended evidence-based pathway. It also has a different side-effect profile and can be associated with a more significant discontinuation syndrome compared to SSRIs.",

            "The correct answer for this question is necrotising enterocolitis.<br /><br />Necrotising enterocolitis is one of the leading causes of death among premature infants. Initial symptoms can include feeding intolerance, abdominal distension and bloody stools, which can quickly progress to abdominal discolouration, perforation and peritonitis. <br /><br />Abdominal x-rays are useful when diagnosing necrotising enterocolitis, as they can show:<br /><br /><ul><li>dilated bowel loops (often asymmetrical in distribution)</li><li>bowel wall oedema</li><li>pneumatosis intestinalis (intramural gas)</li><li>portal venous gas</li><li>pneumoperitoneum resulting from perforation</li><li>air both inside and outside of the bowel wall (Rigler sign)</li><li>air outlining the falciform ligament (football sign)</li></ul><br />Two of these features are present on the abdominal x-ray of the patient in this scenario.<br /><br />Intussusception does not fit the above scenario due to the x-ray findings. Furthermore, the characteristic hallmarks of intussusception on physical examination of a sausage-shaped mass in the right hypochondrium and emptiness in the right lower quadrant (Dance's sign) where not present in this patient.<br /><br />Inflammatory bowel disease is unlikely to affect an infant as young as the one in this scenario, meaning this would not be on a list of likely differentials. <br /><br />The history of the infant described above does not fit in with a differential of pyloric stenosis. Infants with pyloric stenosis generally present with increasing episodes of vomiting following feeding, with these episodes often being described as projectile due to their forceful nature.<br /><br />Hirschsprung's disease is an important differential for this infant. Given the history a diagnosis of Hirschsprung's disease could be a possibility. However, due to necrotising enterocolitis being more prevalent in premature infants it cannot be the 'likeliest' diagnosis in this case.",
