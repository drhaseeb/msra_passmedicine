It is not uncommon for individuals with eating disorders like anorexia nervosa to be deficient in zinc due to inadequate dietary intake.<br /><br /><b>Tocopherol</b> or vitamin E deficiency typically presents with neurological symptoms due to its role in maintaining the integrity of the nervous system.

It is sometimes unclear whether patients are best managed in primary care, by urologists or by nephrologists.<br /><br />The terminology surrounding haematuria is changing. Microscopic or dipstick positive haematuria is increasingly termed non-visible haematuria whilst macroscopic haematuria is termed visible haematuria. Non-visible haematuria is found in around 2.5% of the population.<br /><br />Causes of transient or spurious non-visible haematuria<br /><ul><li>urinary tract infection</li><li>menstruation</li><li>vigorous exercise (this normally settles after around 3 days)</li><li>sexual intercourse</li></ul><br />Causes of persistent non-visible haematuria<br /><ul><li>cancer (bladder, renal, prostate)</li><li>stones</li><li>benign prostatic hyperplasia</li><li>prostatitis</li><li>urethritis e.g. <i>Chlamydia</i></li><li>renal causes: IgA nephropathy, thin basement membrane disease</li><li><span class=\"concept\" data-cid=\"12466\">thin basement membrane disease</span><ul><li>hereditary nephropathy characterised by diffuse thinning of the glomerular basement membrane (GBM), leading to persistent microscopic haematuria</li><li>autosomal dominant with variable penetrance</li><li>estimated to affect 1\u20135% of the general population worldwide</li><li>excellent prognosis</li></ul></li></ul><br />Spurious causes - red/orange urine, where blood is not present on dipstick<br /><ul><li>foods: beetroot, rhubarb</li><li>drugs: rifampicin, doxorubicin</li></ul><br /><h5 class='notes-heading'>Management</h5><br />Current evidence does not support screening for haematuria. The incidence of non-visible haematuria is similar in patients taking aspirin/warfarin to the general population hence these patients should also be investigated.<br /><br />Testing<br /><ul><li>urine dipstick is the test of choice for detecting haematuria</li><li>persistent non-visible haematuria is often defined as blood being present in 2 out of 3 samples tested 2-3 weeks apart</li><li>renal function, albumin:creatinine (ACR) or protein:creatinine ratio (PCR) and blood pressure should also be checked</li><li>urine microscopy may be used but time to analysis significantly affects the number of red blood cells detected</li></ul><br />NICE urgent cancer referral guidelines were updated in 2015.<br /><br /><h5 class='notes-heading'>Urgent referral (i.e. within 2 weeks)</h5><br />Aged >= 45 years AND:<br /><ul><li>unexplained visible haematuria without urinary tract infection, or</li><li>visible haematuria that persists or recurs after successful treatment of urinary tract infection</li></ul><br />Aged >= 60 years AND have unexplained nonvisible haematuria and either dysuria or a raised white cell count on a blood test<br /><br /><h5 class='notes-heading'>Non-urgent referral</h5><br />Aged 60  >= 60 years with recurrent or persistent unexplained urinary tract infection<br /><br />Since the investigation (or not) of non-visible haematuria is such as a common dilemma a number of guidelines have been published. They generally agree with NICE guidance, of note:<br /><ul><li>patients under the age of 40 years with normal renal function, no proteinuria and who are normotensive do not need to be referred and may be managed in primary care</li></ul>",

            "<b>Silicosis</b> is the correct answer. This patient's occupational history as a quarry worker is the key diagnostic clue, as quarrying involves significant exposure to crystalline silicon dioxide dust. The combination of upper zone fibrosis with 'egg-shell' calcification of hilar lymph nodes is pathognomonic of silicosis. This distinctive pattern of lymph node calcification, where calcium is deposited in the periphery of the nodes creating a rim-like appearance, is rarely seen in other conditions. Silicosis develops after prolonged inhalation of silica particles, which are toxic to macrophages and trigger a chronic inflammatory and fibrotic response. The upper zone predominance reflects the preferential deposition of fine particles in these areas. Patients with silicosis are at increased risk of developing tuberculosis due to impaired macrophage function, so screening for TB should be considered. Other occupations at risk include mining, foundry work, slate work, and pottery manufacturing.<br /><br /><b>Sarcoidosis</b> can cause upper zone fibrosis and bilateral hilar lymphadenopathy, making it a plausible differential. However, the lymph node calcification in sarcoidosis, when present, is typically more diffuse rather than the characteristic egg-shell pattern seen here. Additionally, the occupational history of quarry work strongly points away from sarcoidosis. Sarcoidosis more commonly presents with systemic features and often affects younger patients, particularly women. The absence of other systemic manifestations and the specific occupational exposure make this diagnosis less likely.<br /><br /><b>Tuberculosis</b> classically causes upper zone fibrosis and can be associated with calcified lymph nodes, particularly in primary TB. However, TB-related calcification typically occurs within the lymph node parenchyma rather than in the characteristic egg-shell pattern. Furthermore, TB would be expected to present with constitutional symptoms such as fever, night sweats, and weight loss, which are not mentioned here. While silicosis is a risk factor for TB, and dual pathology can occur, the radiological pattern described is more consistent with silicosis itself.<br /><br /><b>Hypersensitivity pneumonitis</b> in its chronic form can cause upper and mid-zone fibrosis. However, it is typically associated with exposure to organic dusts (such as bird proteins or mouldy hay) rather than inorganic silica dust from quarrying. The egg-shell calcification of hilar nodes is not a feature of hypersensitivity pneumonitis. Additionally, chronic hypersensitivity pneumonitis often shows a more diffuse pattern with ground-glass opacification on imaging rather than the discrete upper zone fibrosis with calcified nodes described here.<br /><br /><b>Ankylosing spondylitis</b> can cause upper zone fibrosis, typically bilateral and apical, which may cavitate and become colonised by Aspergillus. However, this is a rare manifestation occurring in advanced disease. Ankylosing spondylitis would be expected to present with characteristic musculoskeletal features including inflammatory back pain, reduced spinal mobility, and sacroiliitis. The egg-shell calcification of hilar lymph nodes is not a feature of ankylosing spondylitis-related lung disease, and the occupational history strongly suggests an alternative diagnosis.",
