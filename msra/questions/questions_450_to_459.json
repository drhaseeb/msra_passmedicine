            "Lateral epicondylitis, or tennis elbow, is caused by repetitive strain involving wrist extension and gripping activities. It is characterised by pain over the lateral epicondyle, where the common extensor tendon originates. The pain is typically worsened by resisted wrist extension, particularly with the elbow extended. Maximal tenderness is felt at the lateral epicondyle. Management includes physiotherapy, activity modification, and analgesia.<br /><br />Medial epicondylitis, or golfer\u2019s elbow, presents with pain on the medial aspect of the forearm, with maximal tenderness over the medial epicondyle. Pain is aggravated by resisted wrist flexion or forearm pronation.<br /><br />Radial tunnel syndrome may mimic lateral epicondylitis but is caused by radial nerve entrapment within the radial tunnel. Pain is typically located 5\u20136 cm distal to the lateral epicondyle rather than directly over it. Neurological features such as altered sensation over the dorsum of the first web space may also be present.<br /><br />De Quervain\u2019s tenosynovitis presents with radial wrist pain that may radiate proximally along the forearm. It is typically exacerbated by gripping or thumb extension.<br /><br />Cervical radiculopathy results from nerve root compression as spinal nerves exit the cervical spine. It usually presents with neck pain and neurological symptoms such as dermatomal sensory loss, motor weakness not limited by pain, and paraesthesia (e.g. pins and needles).",

            "The correct answer is erythema multiforme. This patient is presenting with some giant non-itchy target lesions on her forearm. The name of target lesions comes from the fact they have three concentric colour zones, a darker centre with a blister, a ring around this that is paler pink and raised due to oedema and a bright red outermost ring. This shape of lesion is characteristic of erythema multiforme, a hypersensitivity reaction that is most commonly triggered by infections or drugs usage. This patient is taking amoxicillin (penicillin) for her recurrent urinary tract infections, which probably triggered the reaction.  <br /><br />Bullous pemphigoid is an autoimmune condition causing sub-epidermal blistering of the skin. It is common in elderly patients and is usually itchy. Given that this patient has no blisters and itchiness the diagnosis is unlikely. <br /><br />Erythema marginatum is a form of reactive inflammatory erythema seen in around 10% of the cases of rheumatic fever and it is rare in adults. It involves pink rings on the torso and inner surfaces of the limbs that are barely raised and are non-itchy. In this case, the lesions are not itchy, but they are clearly raised. This patient does not complain of other symptoms, making this diagnosis unlikely. <br /><br />Erythema nodosum is an inflammation of subcutaneous fat that typically causes tender, erythematous, nodular lesions. It typically occurs on the shins. It can be caused by an infection or a systemic disease such as sarcoidosis. This patient's lesions are targeted lesions, whilst in erythema nodosum, you would expect a more of a 'bulging' lesion. <br /><br />Stevens-Johnson syndrome is a severe systemic reaction affecting the skin and mucosa, almost always caused by a drug reaction. The characteristic rash is typically maculopapular with target lesions. This patient has this type of lesion, however, this patient is systematically well, whilst in Stevens-Johnson syndrome, fever and arthralgia extremely are common. The condition causes epidermolysis (blistering and peeling) which causes severe fluid loss, causing the patient to feel extremely unwell. This is not seen in this patient.",

        "body": "Age-related macular degeneration is the most common cause of blindness in the UK. Degeneration of the central retina (macula) is the key feature with changes usually bilateral. ARMD is characterised by degeneration of retinal photoreceptors that results in the formation of drusen which can be seen on fundoscopy and retinal photography. It is more common with advancing age and is more common in females.<br /><br />Risk factors<br /><ul><li>advancing age itself is the greatest risk factor for ARMD<ul><li>the risk of ARMD increases 3 fold for patients aged older than 75 years, versus those aged 65-74.</li></ul></li><li><span class=\"concept\" data-cid=\"640\">smoking</span><ul><li>current smokers are twice as likely as non-smokers to have ARMD related visual loss, and ex-smokers have a slightly increased risk of developing the condition, (OR 1.13). </li></ul></li><li>family history is also a strong risk factor for developing ARMD<ul><li>first degree relatives of a sufferer of ARMD are thought to be four times more likely to inherit the condition.</li></ul></li><li>other risk factors for developing the condition include those associated with an increased risk of ischaemic cardiovascular disease, such as hypertension, dyslipidaemia and diabetes mellitus. </li></ul><br /><br /><h5 class='notes-heading'>Classification</h5><br />Traditionally two forms of macular degeneration are seen:<br /><ul><li>dry macular degeneration<ul><li>90% of cases</li><li>also known as atrophic</li><li>characterised by <span class=\"concept\" data-cid=\"639\">drusen</span>  - yellow round spots in Bruch's membrane</li></ul></li><li>wet macular degeneration<ul><li>10% of cases</li><li>also known as exudative or neovascular macular degeneration</li><li>characterised by <span class=\"concept\" data-cid=\"11900\">choroidal neovascularisation</span></li><li>leakage of serous fluid and blood can subsequently result in a rapid loss of vision</li><li>carries the worst prognosis</li></ul></li></ul><br />Recently there has been a move to a more updated classification:<br /><ul><li>early age-related macular degeneration (non-exudative, age-related maculopathy): drusen and alterations to the retinal pigment epithelium (RPE)</li><li>late age-related macular degeneration (neovascularisation, exudative)</li></ul><br /><h5 class='notes-heading'>Clinical features</h5><br />Patients typically present with a subacute onset of visual loss with:<br /><ul><li>a reduction in visual acuity, particularly for near field objects<ul><li>gradual in dry ARMD </li><li>subacute in wet ARMD</li></ul></li><li><span class=\"concept\" data-cid=\"12500\">worse in the centre of vision</span> (e.g. difficulty reading, recognising faces, driving)</li><li>difficulties in dark adaptation with an overall deterioration in vision at night</li><li>fluctuations in visual disturbance which may vary significantly from day to day</li><li>they may also suffer from photopsia, (a perception of flickering or flashing lights), and glare around objects</li><li>visual hallucinations may also occur resulting in Charles-Bonnet syndrome</li></ul><br />Signs:<br /><ul><li>distortion of line perception may be noted on <span class=\"concept\" data-cid=\"11392\">Amsler grid testing</span></li><li>fundoscopy reveals the presence of drusen, yellow areas of pigment deposition in the macular area, which may become confluent in late disease to form a macular scar.</li><li>in wet ARMD well demarcated red patches may be seen which represent intra-retinal or sub-retinal fluid leakage or haemorrhage. </li></ul>   <br />Investigations:<br /><ul><li>slit-lamp microscopy is the initial investigation of choice, to identify any pigmentary, exudative or haemorrhagic changes affecting the retina which may identify the presence of ARMD. This is usually accompanied by colour fundus photography to provide a baseline against which changes can be identified over time.</li><li>fluorescein angiography is utilised if neovascular ARMD is suspected, as this can guide intervention with anti-VEGF therapy. This may be complemented with indocyanine green angiography to visualise any changes in the choroidal circulation. </li><li>optical coherence tomography is used to visualise the retina in three dimensions because it can reveal areas of disease which aren't visible using microscopy alone. </li></ul><br /><h5 class='notes-heading'>Management</h5><br />Treatment<br /><ul><li>the AREDS trial examined the treatment of dry ARMD in 3640 subjects. It showed that a combination of zinc with anti-oxidant vitamins A,C and E reduced progression of the disease by around one third. Patients with more extensive drusen seemed to benefit most from the intervention. Treatment is therefore recommended in patients with at least moderate category dry ARMD. </li><li><span class=\"concept\" data-cid=\"4069\">vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF)</span> <ul><li>VEGR is a potent mitogen and drives increased vascular permeability in patients with wet ARMD</li><li>a number of trials have shown that use of anti-VEGF agents can limit progression of wet ARMD and stabilise or reverse visual loss</li><li>evidence suggests that they should be instituted within the first two months of diagnosis of wet ARMD if possible</li><li>examples of anti-VEGF agents include ranibizumab, <span class=\"concept\" data-cid=\"11448\">bevacizumab</span> and pegaptanib,. The agents are usually administered by 4 weekly injection. </li></ul></li><li>laser photocoagulation does slow progression of ARMD where there is new vessel formation, although there is a risk of acute visual loss after treatment, which may be increased in patients with sub-foveal ARMD. For this reason anti-VEGF therapies are usually preferred.</li></ul>",

            "<b>ACE inhibitor-induced angioedema</b> is the most likely diagnosis in this case. This patient presents with the classic features of angioedema affecting the face, lips, and tongue without urticaria, and she is taking ramipril, an ACE inhibitor. ACE inhibitor-induced angioedema is the most common cause of drug-induced angioedema without urticaria. It occurs due to increased bradykinin levels as ACE normally breaks down bradykinin. This type of angioedema can occur at any time during treatment, even months or years after starting the medication. The absence of urticaria is characteristic of ACE inhibitor-induced angioedema, distinguishing it from allergic reactions. The condition can be life-threatening if it involves the larynx and requires immediate discontinuation of the ACE inhibitor.<br /><br /><b>Calcium channel blocker-induced angioedema</b> is much less common than ACE inhibitor-induced angioedema. While amlodipine can rarely cause angioedema, it is not typically associated with this presentation. Calcium channel blockers more commonly cause peripheral oedema rather than angioedema. Given that the patient is taking ramipril, which is a well-known cause of angioedema, this would be a less likely explanation for her symptoms.<br /><br /><b>Hereditary angioedema</b> typically presents earlier in life, often during childhood or adolescence, and has a family history.

        "question": "A 62-year-old woman presents to the emergency department with facial swelling that developed over 6 hours. She has swelling of her lips, tongue, and periorbital areas but no rash or wheals. Her medical history includes hypertension and type 2 diabetes. She takes ramipril, metformin, and amlodipine.<br /><br />What is the most likely cause of her presentation?",
        "correct_answer": "1",
        "question_notes": "<b>ACE inhibitor-induced angioedema</b> is the most likely diagnosis in this case. This patient presents with the classic features of angioedema affecting the face, lips, and tongue without urticaria, and she is taking ramipril, an ACE inhibitor. ACE inhibitor-induced angioedema is the most common cause of drug-induced angioedema without urticaria. It occurs due to increased bradykinin levels as ACE normally breaks down bradykinin. This type of angioedema can occur at any time during treatment, even months or years after starting the medication. The absence of urticaria is characteristic of ACE inhibitor-induced angioedema, distinguishing it from allergic reactions. The condition can be life-threatening if it involves the larynx and requires immediate discontinuation of the ACE inhibitor.<br /><br /><b>Calcium channel blocker-induced angioedema</b> is much less common than ACE inhibitor-induced angioedema. While amlodipine can rarely cause angioedema, it is not typically associated with this presentation. Calcium channel blockers more commonly cause peripheral oedema rather than angioedema. Given that the patient is taking ramipril, which is a well-known cause of angioedema, this would be a less likely explanation for her symptoms.<br /><br /><b>Hereditary angioedema</b> typically presents earlier in life, often during childhood or adolescence, and has a family history. It is caused by C1 esterase inhibitor deficiency and usually affects the face, lips, tongue, and sometimes the larynx and gastrointestinal tract. While it can present later in life, the timing of this presentation in a patient taking ACE inhibitors makes drug-induced angioedema more likely.<br /><br /><b>Allergic angioedema</b> is usually associated with urticaria (wheals/hives) and occurs rapidly after exposure to an allergen such as foods, medications, or environmental triggers.

            "The correct answer is that <b>following a hip replacement patients should avoid crossing their legs</b>. This is a crucial post-operative instruction given to patients following total hip arthroplasty to prevent dislocation of the prosthesis. The hip is most unstable in the first few months after surgery, and certain movements, including adduction past the midline (crossing legs), internal rotation, and flexion beyond 90 degrees, can compromise the stability of the new joint. These movement restrictions are often referred to as 'hip precautions' and are essential for successful recovery.<br /><br /><b>Hip resurfacing is now the most common type of hip replacement operation performed in the UK</b> is incorrect. Total hip arthroplasty remains the gold standard and most common procedure. Hip resurfacing, while still performed, has declined in popularity due to concerns about metal-on-metal articulations and associated complications such as adverse reactions to metal debris (ARMD).<br /><br /><b>Patients should be encouraged to avoid using walking sticks in weeks 2-6 following a hip operation</b> is incorrect. Walking aids are an essential part of rehabilitation following hip surgery. They help protect the operated hip by allowing partial weight-bearing as prescribed and improve balance and confidence. Patients typically progress from a frame to crutches or sticks as their strength and mobility improve.<br /><br /><b>Patients who are under the age of 60 years should be discouraged from having joint replacement surgery</b> is incorrect. Age alone is not a contraindication to joint replacement surgery. The decision should be based on symptoms, functional impairment, and failure of conservative management. Younger patients with severe arthritis can benefit significantly from joint replacement, although they may need revision surgery later in life.<br /><br /><b>Hip replacement surgery should not be offered to patients with a BMI > 28 kg/m^2</b> is incorrect. While obesity can increase surgical risks and complications, a BMI of 28 kg/m^2 is only slightly overweight and would not be a contraindication to surgery. Current UK guidelines suggest optimising BMI where possible but do not specify an absolute cut-off.
