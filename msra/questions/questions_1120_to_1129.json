            "<b>Bisoprolol</b> is the correct answer. According to NICE guidelines (CG126) on the management of stable angina, the first-line treatment for preventing anginal episodes is either a beta-blocker or a rate-limiting calcium channel blocker. The choice depends on patient preference, co-morbidities, and potential contraindications. Beta-blockers, like bisoprolol, reduce myocardial oxygen demand by decreasing heart rate, blood pressure, and myocardial contractility, thereby reducing the frequency and severity of angina attacks. This patient has a classic history of stable angina, and initiating a beta-blocker is the standard, evidence-based approach to manage his symptoms. While all patients should also be started on aspirin and a statin for secondary prevention, the question specifically asks for a medication to prevent the episodes of chest tightness.<br /><br /><b>Amlodipine</b> is a plausible but incorrect option. Amlodipine is a dihydropyridine calcium channel blocker (CCB). While a CCB is a first-line option for stable angina, NICE recommends a rate-limiting CCB (e.g., diltiazem or verapamil) if used as monotherapy. Dihydropyridine CCBs like amlodipine are typically used as second-line agents, added to a beta-blocker if symptoms persist. This is because they primarily act as vasodilators and can cause a reflex tachycardia, which may increase myocardial oxygen demand, potentially worsening angina if used alone. They are therefore best used in combination with a beta-blocker which will control the heart rate.<br /><br /><b>Aspirin</b> is incorrect in the context of this question. While it is essential that this patient is started on aspirin 75mg once daily (along with a statin) for secondary prevention of cardiovascular events like myocardial infarction and stroke, it does not have a role in the symptomatic prevention of angina episodes. Aspirin is an antiplatelet agent that prevents thrombus formation but does not alleviate the supply-demand mismatch in the myocardium that causes anginal pain. The question specifically asks for a treatment to prevent further episodes of chest tightness, not to reduce long-term cardiovascular risk.<br /><br /><b>Isosorbide mononitrate</b> is incorrect as a first-line agent. This is a long-acting nitrate. Nitrates are considered second or third-line therapy for the prevention of angina. They are typically added if a patient remains symptomatic despite optimal doses of a beta-blocker and/or a calcium channel blocker, or if these first-line agents are contraindicated or not tolerated. They are not recommended as initial monotherapy for the prevention of stable angina.<br /><br /><b>Sublingual glyceryl trinitrate</b> (GTN) is incorrect because it is used for the immediate relief of acute angina attacks, not for long-term prevention of episodes. All patients diagnosed with stable angina should be prescribed a fast-acting nitrate like sublingual GTN or a GTN spray to use as required when they experience chest pain. It provides rapid vasodilation, relieving symptoms within minutes. However, its effect is short-lived, and it is not used as a scheduled medication for prophylaxis.",

            "<b>Amlodipine</b> is the archetypal dihydropyridine calcium-channel blocker and peripheral ankle oedema is its hallmark adverse effect, occurring in up to 10\u201315 % of patients. The drug selectively relaxes precapillary arterioles, increasing hydrostatic pressure within capillaries while leaving post-capillary venous tone unchanged. This pressure gradient pushes fluid into the interstitial space, producing painless, pitting oedema that typically appears after a few weeks of therapy and is bilateral. The phenomenon is dose-related, improves on stopping the drug or switching to a different antihypertensive class, and is not due to salt and water retention, so diuretics are usually ineffective. Recognising this mechanism allows the clinician to reassure the patient and alter therapy appropriately.<br /><br /><b>Perindopril</b>, an ACE inhibitor, more commonly causes cough, taste disturbance and, rarely, angio-oedema rather than dependent peripheral oedema. In fact, by reducing afterload and promoting natriuresis, ACE inhibitors can improve congestive ankle swelling secondary to heart failure. Consequently, although perindopril is a very widely used antihypertensive, it is not usually implicated when isolated ankle swelling develops in an otherwise well patient.<br /><br /><b>Indapamide</b> is a thiazide-like diuretic. Its recognised adverse effects include hypokalaemia, hyponatraemia, gout and a mild photosensitive rash. It promotes renal sodium and water loss, so it would be expected to relieve, not precipitate, peripheral oedema. Ankle swelling developing while on indapamide should prompt the clinician to look for another cause, such as concomitant amlodipine therapy or underlying cardiac disease.<br /><br /><b>Losartan</b>, an angiotensin II receptor blocker, shares many side-effects with ACE inhibitors but ankle oedema is not a characteristic problem. By blocking the renin\u2013angiotensin pathway it tends to reduce venous and arterial pressures and is sometimes used as part of combination therapy precisely because it does not exacerbate dihydropyridine-induced swelling.<br /><br /><b>Diltiazem</b> is a non-dihydropyridine calcium-channel blocker with more pronounced effects on the myocardium and cardiac conduction than on peripheral vasculature. Although mild ankle oedema can occur, it is far less common than with dihydropyridines like amlodipine. Bradycardia, constipation and worsening of heart failure in susceptible patients are considerably more typical. Therefore, in a patient presenting primarily with ankle swelling after starting antihypertensive therapy, diltiazem is a less likely culprit than amlodipine.",

            "The correct answer is <b>Molluscum contagiosum</b>. This viral infection, caused by a poxvirus, characteristically presents with multiple dome-shaped papules with central umbilication. The clinical scenario perfectly describes the typical presentation: multiple small (1-2mm) raised lesions with an umbilicated appearance, which spread over time from a single lesion. The condition is common in children and young adults, and can be sexually transmitted in adults. The lesions typically persist for 6-12 months before spontaneously resolving.<br /><br /><b>Genital warts</b> are caused by Human Papillomavirus (HPV) and typically present as flesh-coloured papules with a rough, cauliflower-like appearance. They do not show umbilication and are usually found in the anogenital region. While they can spread, they don't typically present with the smooth, dome-shaped appearance described in this case.<br /><br /><b>Lichen planus</b> presents with purple, polygonal, pruritic papules and plaques, often with a white lacy pattern (Wickham's striae) visible on their surface. The lesions are typically larger than 1-2mm and lack umbilication. They commonly affect the flexor surfaces of wrists, legs, and oral mucosa.<br /><br /><b>Keratosis pilaris</b> presents as multiple small, rough follicular papules, typically on the upper arms, thighs, and cheeks. These lesions are associated with dry skin, appear as 'chicken skin', and do not show umbilication. They are typically symmetrical and present from childhood.<br /><br /><b>Folliculitis</b> is an inflammation of hair follicles, presenting as small, red, tender pustules centred on hair follicles. The lesions are typically inflamed and may be painful or itchy, unlike the painless, flesh-coloured lesions described in this case. They also tend to resolve more quickly and don't show the characteristic umbilication seen in molluscum contagiosum.",

        "body": "Molluscum contagiosum is a common skin infection caused by molluscum contagiosum virus (MCV), a member of the <span class=\"concept\" data-cid=\"11963\">Poxviridae family</span>. Transmission occurs directly by close personal contact, or indirectly via fomites (contaminated surfaces) such as shared towels and flannels. The majority of cases occur in children (often in children with atopic eczema), with the maximum incidence in preschool children aged 1-4 years.<br /><br />Typically, molluscum contagiosum presents with characteristic pinkish or pearly white papules with a central umbilication, which are up to 5 mm in diameter. Lesions appear in clusters in areas anywhere on the body (except the palms of the hands and the soles of the feet). In children, lesions are commonly seen on the trunk and in flexures, but anogenital lesions may also occur. In adults, sexual contact may lead to lesions developing on the genitalia, pubis, thighs, and lower abdomen. Rarely, lesions can occur on the oral mucosa and on the eyelids.<br /><br /><div class=\"container\"><div class=\"row\"><div class=\"col-md-3\"><a href=\"https://d32xxyeh8kfs8k.cloudfront.net/images_Passmedicine/dsd121b.jpg\" data-fancybox=\"gallery\" data-caption=\"Molluscum contagiosum .
