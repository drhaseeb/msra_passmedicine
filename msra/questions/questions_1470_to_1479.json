They therefore are used for a variety of purposes:<br /><ul><li>sedation</li><li>hypnotic</li><li>anxiolytic </li><li>anticonvulsant</li><li>muscle relaxant</li></ul><br />Patients commonly develop a tolerance and dependence to benzodiazepines and care should therefore be exercised on prescribing these drugs. The Committee on Safety of Medicines advises that benzodiazepines are only prescribed for a short period of time (2-4 weeks).<br /><br />The BNF gives advice on how to withdraw a benzodiazepine. The dose should be withdrawn in steps of about <span class=\"concept\" data-cid=\"12518\">1/8 (range 1/10 to 1/4) of the daily dose every fortnight</span>. A suggested protocol for patients experiencing difficulty is given:<br /><ul><li>switch patients to the equivalent dose of diazepam</li><li>reduce dose of diazepam every 2-3 weeks in steps of 2 or 2.5 mg</li><li>time needed for withdrawal can vary from 4 weeks to a year or more</li></ul><br />If patients withdraw too quickly from benzodiazepines they may experience benzodiazepine withdrawal syndrome, a condition very similar to alcohol withdrawal syndrome.

            "<b>Carbon-13 urea breath test</b> is the correct answer. NICE guidelines for managing dyspepsia recommend either a carbon-13 urea breath test or a stool antigen test as the preferred initial diagnostic tests for <i>H. pylori</i> infection in primary care. These tests detect active infection and have high sensitivity and specificity (both >95%). The carbon-13 urea breath test works by detecting the presence of urease enzyme produced by <i>H. pylori</i>, which breaks down ingested labelled urea into carbon dioxide that can be measured in expired breath. This patient presents with uncomplicated dyspepsia without alarm features, making her suitable for a 'test and treat' approach in primary care. The test is non-invasive, accurate, and can be performed in the community setting. Patients must avoid proton pump inhibitors for 2 weeks and antibiotics for 4 weeks before testing to avoid false-negative results.<br /><br /><b>Serology for <i>H. pylori</i> antibodies</b> is not recommended as a first-line test. While NICE guidelines mention laboratory-based serology 'where its performance has been locally validated', serology has significant limitations. It detects antibodies rather than active infection, meaning it cannot distinguish between current and past infection. Antibodies may persist for months to years after successful eradication, making serology unsuitable for diagnosing active infection or confirming eradication. The sensitivity and specificity are also generally lower than breath or stool antigen tests.<br /><br /><b>Oesophagogastroduodenoscopy with biopsy</b> is not indicated as a first-line investigation for this patient. She is under 55 years old and has no alarm features (such as dysphagia, weight loss, upper abdominal mass, or haematemesis) that would warrant urgent endoscopy. Endoscopy is invasive, expensive, and carries risks. It should be reserved for patients meeting referral criteria or those with treatment-resistant symptoms despite appropriate management in primary care.<br /><br /><b>Rapid urease test</b> requires endoscopy to obtain gastric biopsies, making it inappropriate as an initial test in primary care. The rapid urease test (CLO test) is performed on biopsy specimens obtained during endoscopy and detects urease enzyme activity. While accurate, it is only appropriate when endoscopy is already indicated for other reasons. This patient does not meet criteria for endoscopy and should be managed with non-invasive testing first.<br /><br /><b>Faecal occult blood test</b> is not appropriate for diagnosing <i>H. pylori</i> infection. While stool tests are used for <i>H. pylori</i> detection, the faecal occult blood test specifically looks for blood in stool, not bacterial antigens. This test would be used to investigate suspected gastrointestinal bleeding or as part of colorectal cancer screening, neither of which is indicated in this clinical scenario. The appropriate stool test for <i>H. pylori</i> would be a stool antigen test, which directly detects bacterial antigens indicating active infection.",

For example, 15mg modified-release morphine tablets twice a day with 5mg of oral morphine solution as required</li><li>oral modified-release morphine should be used in preference to transdermal patches</li><li>laxatives should be prescribed for all patients initiating strong opioids</li><li>patients should be advised that nausea is often transient. If it persists then an antiemetic should be offered</li><li>drowsiness is usually transient - if it does not settle then adjustment of the dose should be considered</li></ul><br /><h5 class='notes-heading'>SIGN guidelines</h5><br />SIGN issued guidance on the control of pain in adults with cancer in 2008. Selected points<br /><ul><li>the breakthrough dose of morphine is <span class=\"concept\" data-cid=\"232\">one-sixth</span> the daily dose of morphine</li><li>all patients who receive opioids should be prescribed a laxative</li><li>opioids should be used with caution in patients with chronic kidney disease<ul><li><span class=\"concept\" data-cid=\"1456\">oxycodone is preferred to morphine in palliative patients with mild-moderate renal impairment</span> </li><li>if renal impairment is more severe, alfentanil, <span class=\"concept\" data-cid=\"10059\">buprenorphine and fentanyl</span> are preferred</li></ul></li><li><span class=\"concept\" data-cid=\"233\">metastatic bone pain</span> may respond to strong opioids, bisphosphonates or radiotherapy. The assertion that NSAIDs are particularly effective for metastatic bone pain is not supported by studies. Strong opioids have the lowest number needed to treat for relieving the pain and can provide quick relief, in contrast to radiotherapy and bisphosphonates*. All patients, however, should be considered for referral to a clinical oncologist for consideration of further treatments such as radiotherapy</li></ul><br /><h5 class='notes-heading'>Other points</h5><br />When increasing the dose of opioids the next dose should be increased by <span class=\"concept\" data-cid=\"236\">30-50%</span>.<br /><br />In addition to strong opioids, bisphosphonates and radiotherapy, <span class=\"concept\" data-cid=\"4579\">denosumab</span> may be used to treat metastatic bone pain.<br /><br /><h5 class='notes-heading'>Opioid side-effects</h5><br /><div class=\"table-responsive\"><table class = \"tlarge table table-striped table-bordered\"  data-role=\"table\" id=\"tableid1\" ><thead><tr><th><b>Usually transient</b></th><th><b>Usually persistent</b></th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Nausea<br /><span class=\"concept\" data-cid=\"9215\">Drowsiness</span></td><td><span class=\"concept\" data-cid=\"9212\">Constipation</span></td></tr></tbody></table></div><br /><h5 class='notes-heading'>Conversion between opioids</h5><br /><div class=\"table-responsive\"><table class = \"tlarge table table-striped table-bordered\"  data-role=\"table\" id=\"tableid2\" ><thead><tr><th><b>From</b></th><th><b>To</b></th><th><b>Conversion factor</b></th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Oral codeine</td><td>Oral morphine</td><td><span class=\"concept\" data-cid=\"235\">Divide by 10</span></td></tr><tr><td>Oral tramadol</td><td>Oral morphine</td><td><span class=\"concept\" data-cid=\"234\">Divide by 10</span>**</td></tr></tbody></table></div><br />Oxycodone generally causes less sedation, vomiting and pruritis than morphine but more constipation.<br /><br /><div class=\"table-responsive\"><table class = \"tlarge table table-striped table-bordered\"  data-role=\"table\" id=\"tableid3\" ><thead><tr><th><b>From</b></th><th><b>To</b></th><th><b>Conversion factor</b></th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Oral morphine</td><td>Oral oxycodone</td><td>Divide by 1.5-2***</td></tr></tbody></table></div><br />The current BNF gives the following conversion factors for transdermal perparations<br /><ul><li>a transdermal fentanyl 12 microgram patch equates to approximately 30 mg oral morphine daily</li><li>a transdermal buprenorphine 10 microgram patch equates to approximately 24 mg oral morphine daily.</li></ul><br /><div class=\"table-responsive\"><table class = \"tlarge table table-striped table-bordered\"  data-role=\"table\" id=\"tableid4\" ><thead><tr><th><b>From</b></th><th><b>To</b></th><th><b>Conversion factor</b></th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Oral morphine</td><td>Subcutaneous morphine</td><td><span class=\"concept\" data-cid=\"4508\">Divide by 2</span></td></tr><tr><td>Oral morphine</td><td>Subcutaneous diamorphine</td><td>Divide by 3</td></tr><tr><td>Oral oxycodone</td><td>Subcutaneous diamorphine</td><td>Divide by 1.5</td></tr></tbody></table></div><br />*BMJ 2015;350:h315 Cancer induced bone pain<br /><br />**this has previously been stated as 5 but the current version of the BNF states a conversion of 10<br /><br />***historically a conversion factor of 2 has been used (i.e. oral oxycodone is twice as strong as oral morphine).

            "<b>Weber's syndrome</b> is the correct answer. This is a type of brainstem stroke, specifically in the midbrain. It occurs due to an occlusion in a branch of the posterior cerebral artery. The syndrome is characterised by an ipsilateral cranial nerve III palsy (oculomotor nerve) and contralateral hemiparesis (weakness). This fits the scenario described above as the man has experienced a right oculomotor nerve lesion shown by the enlarged pupil due to loss of parasympathetic innervation and 'down and out' pupil position, due to only cranial nerve IV and cranial nerve VI remaining.<br /><br /><b>Bell's palsy</b> is incorrect. A presentation of unilateral facial droop with eyebrow involvement would indicate Bell's palsy. However, the involvement of limb weakness excludes this option as Bell's palsy only affects the facial nerve.<br /><br /><b>Lacunar stoke</b> is incorrect. Lacunar stroke involves an infarction to the subcortical region of the brain. Hemiparesis and hemisensory loss are common findings. A risk factor is hypertension. The patient would report a change in temperature sensation, touch and taste, as well as a sign of ataxia. There are no eye signs or symptoms in a lacunar stroke so this answer is unlikely.<br /><br /><b>Lateral pontine syndrome</b> is incorrect. This is a stroke affecting the pons meaning the cranial nerve nuclei arising from the pons are affected here. Facial paralysis and deafness are common findings on the same side as the infarction. This is accompanied by contralateral weakness. Facial paralysis and deafness are not a concern in this patient making this an unlikely diagnosis.<br /><br /><b>Wallenburg syndrome (lateral medullary syndrome)</b> is incorrect. This presents with ipsilateral facial pain and temperature loss. Along with contralateral limb/ torso pain, ataxia and nystagmus. These signs have not been reported in this patient.",

This class of drugs primarily blocks D2 dopamine receptors and they are particularly effective in treating the positive symptoms of schizophrenia, such as hallucinations and delusions.

            "The correct answer is <b>Norepinephrine and dopamine reuptake inhibitor, and nicotinic antagonist</b>. Bupropion is an atypical antidepressant and smoking cessation aid. Its primary mechanism of action involves the inhibition of the reuptake of norepinephrine and dopamine, thereby increasing their synaptic concentrations. It also acts as a non-competitive antagonist of nicotinic acetylcholine receptors, which is thought to contribute to its efficacy in smoking cessation.<br /><br />Discussing the incorrect options:<br /><br /><b>Nicotinic receptor partial agonist</b> would be incorrect as this describes the mechanism of varenicline, another medication used in smoking cessation. Varenicline works by partially activating the nicotinic acetylcholine receptor, reducing cravings for nicotine and withdrawal symptoms.<br /><br /><b>Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI)</b> is not correct. SSRIs are a class of drugs typically used in the treatment of depression and anxiety disorders. They work by inhibiting the reuptake of serotonin into presynaptic cells, increasing serotonin levels in the synaptic cleft. Bupropion does not significantly affect serotonergic systems.<br /><br />A <b>Dopamine agonist</b> directly stimulates dopamine receptors. This is different from bupropion's mechanism; while it increases dopamine concentrations by inhibiting its reuptake, it does not directly stimulate dopamine receptors.<br /><br />Lastly, a <b>Dopamine antagonist</b> blocks dopamine receptors, preventing dopamine from exerting its effects. This is opposite to bupropion's action; rather than blocking dopamine's effects, bupropion works to increase available dopamine in the brain by blocking its reuptake.<br />",

        "body": "NICE released guidance in 2008 on the management of smoking cessation. General points include:<br /><ul><li>patients should be offered nicotine replacement therapy (NRT), varenicline or bupropion - NICE state that clinicians should not favour one medication over another</li><li>NRT, varenicline or bupropion should normally be prescribed as part of a commitment to stop smoking on or before a particular date (target stop date)</li><li>prescription of NRT, varenicline or bupropion should be sufficient to last only until 2 weeks after the target stop date. Normally, this will be after 2 weeks of NRT therapy, and 3-4 weeks for varenicline and bupropion, to allow for the different methods of administration and mode of action. Further prescriptions should be given only to people who have demonstrated that their quit attempt is continuing</li><li>if unsuccessful using NRT, varenicline or bupropion, do not offer a repeat prescription within 6 months unless special circumstances have intervened</li><li>do not offer NRT, varenicline or bupropion in any combination</li></ul><br />Nicotine replacement therapy<br /><ul><li>adverse effects include nausea & vomiting, headaches and flu-like symptoms</li><li>NICE recommend offering a combination of nicotine patches and another form of NRT (such as gum, inhalator, lozenge or nasal spray) to people who show a high level of dependence on nicotine or who have found single forms of NRT inadequate in the past</li></ul><br />Varenicline<br /><ul><li>a nicotinic receptor partial agonist</li><li>should be started 1 week before the patients target date to stop</li><li>the recommended course of treatment is 12 weeks (but patients should be monitored regularly and treatment only continued if not smoking)</li><li>has been shown in studies to be more effective than bupropion</li><li>nausea is the most common adverse effect. Other common problems include headache, insomnia, abnormal dreams</li><li>varenicline should be used with caution in patients with a history of depression or self-harm. There are ongoing studies looking at the risk of suicidal behaviour in patients taking varenicline</li><li>contraindicated in pregnancy and breastfeeding</li></ul><br />Bupropion<br /><ul><li><span class=\"concept\" data-cid=\"12264\">a norepinephrine-dopamine reuptake inhibitor and nicotinic antagonist</span><ul><li>unlike many antidepressants it has a minimal effect on serotonin</li></ul></li><li>should be started 1 to 2 weeks before the patient's target date to stop</li><li><span class=\"concept\" data-cid=\"1699\">small risk of seizures (1 in 1,000)</span></li><li>contraindicated in <span class=\"concept\" data-cid=\"1699\">epilepsy</span>, pregnancy and breast feeding. Having an eating disorder is a relative contraindication</li></ul><br /><h5 class='notes-heading'>Pregnant women</h5><br />NICE recommended in 2010 that all pregnant women should be tested for smoking using <span class=\"concept\" data-cid=\"691\">carbon monoxide detectors</span>, partly because <i>'some women find it difficult to say that they smoke because the pressure not to smoke during pregnancy is so intense.'</i>. All women who smoke, or have stopped smoking within the last 2 weeks, or those with a CO reading of 7 ppm or above should be referred to NHS Stop Smoking Services.<br /><br />Interventions<br /><ul><li>the first-line interventions in pregnancy should be cognitive behaviour therapy, motivational interviewing or structured self-help and support from NHS Stop Smoking Services</li><li>the evidence for the use of <span class=\"concept\" data-cid=\"11172\">NRT</span> in pregnancy is mixed but it is often used if the above measures failure. There is no evidence that it affects the child's birthweight. Pregnant women should remove the patches before going to bed</li><li>as mentioned above, varenicline and bupropion are contraindicated</li></ul>",
