        "body": "VTEs can cause severe morbidity and mortality, but they are preventable. Current NICE guidelines (updated for 2018) outline recommendations for assessment and management of patients at risk of VTE in hospital. <br /><br /><br /><h5 class='notes-heading'>Risk factors</h5><br />All patients admitted to hospital should be individually assessed to identify risk factors for VTE development and bleeding risk. For medical and surgical patients the recommended risk proforma is the department of healths VTE risk assessment tool.<br /><br />The following inpatients would be deemed at increased risk of developing a VTE:<br /><br />Medical patients:<br /><ul><li>significant reduction in mobility for 3 days or more (or anticipated to have significantly reduced mobility)</li></ul><br />Surgical/trauma patients:<br /><ul><li>hip/knee replacement</li><li>hip fracture</li><li>general anaesthetic and a surgical duration of over 90 minutes</li><li>surgery of the pelvis or lower limb with a general anaesthetic and a surgical duration of over 60 minutes</li><li>acute surgical admission with an inflammatory/intra-abdominal condition</li><li>surgery with a significant reduction in mobility</li></ul><br />General risk factors:<br /><ul><li>active cancer/chemotherapy</li><li>aged over 60</li><li>known blood clotting disorder (e.g. thrombophilia)</li><li>BMI over 35</li><li>dehydration</li><li>one or more significant medical comorbidities (e.g. heart disease; metabolic/endocrine pathologies; respiratory disease; acute infectious disease and inflammatory conditions)</li><li>critical care admission</li><li>use of hormone replacement therapy (HRT)</li><li>use of the combined oral contraceptive pill</li><li>varicose veins</li><li>pregnant or less than 6 weeks post-partum</li></ul><br />After a patients VTE risk has been assessed, this should be compared to their risk of bleeding to decide whether VTE prophylaxis should be offered. If indicated VTE prophylaxis should be started as soon as possible. <br /><br /><br /><h5 class='notes-heading'>Types of VTE prophylaxis</h5><br />Mechanical:<br /><ul><li>Correctly fitted anti-embolism (aka compression) stockings (thigh or knee height)</li><li>An Intermittent pneumatic compression device</li></ul><br />Pharmacological:<br /><ul><li>Fondaparinux sodium (SC injection)</li><li>Low molecular weight heparin (LMWH)<ul><li>e.g. enoxaparin</li><li>reduced doses should be used in patients with severe renal impairment</li></ul></li><li>Unfractionated heparin (UFH)<ul><li>used as an alternative to LWMH in patients with chronic kidney disease</li></ul></li></ul><br /><br /><h5 class='notes-heading'>Management</h5><br />In general, all medical patients deemed at risk of VTE after individual assessment are started on pharmacological VTE prophylaxis. This is providing the risk of VTE outweighs the risk of bleeding (this is often a clinical judgement) and there are no contraindications. Those at very high risk may be offered anti-embolic stockings alongside the pharmacological methods. <br /><br />For surgical patients at low risk of VTE first-line treatment is anti-embolism stockings. If a patient is at high risk these stockings are used in conjunction with pharmacological prophylaxis. <br /><br /><br /><h5 class='notes-heading'>Advice for patients</h5><br />Pre-surgical interventions:<br /><ul><li><span class=\"concept\" data-cid=\"11411\">Advise women to stop taking their combined oral contraceptive pill/hormone replacement therapy 4 weeks before surgery</span></li></ul><br />Post-surgical interventions: <br /><ul><li>Try to mobilise patients as soon as possible after surgery </li><li>Ensure the patient is hydrated</li></ul><br /><br /><h5 class='notes-heading'>Post procedure prophylaxis</h5><br />For certain surgical procedures (hip and knee replacements) pharmacological VTE prophylaxis is recommended for all patients to reduce the risk of a VTE developing post-surgery. NICE make the following recommendations:<br /><br /><div class=\"table-responsive\"><table class = \"tlarge table table-striped table-bordered\"  data-role=\"table\" id=\"tableid1\" ><thead><tr><th><b>Procedure</b></th><th><b>Prophylaxis</b></th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Elective hip</td><td>LMWH for 10 days followed by aspirin (75 or 150 mg) for a further 28 days<br /><br />or<br /><br />LMWH for 28 days combined with anti-embolism stockings until discharge<br /><br />or<br /><br />Rivaroxaban</td></tr><tr><td>Elective knee</td><td>Aspirin (75 or 150 mg) for 14 days<br /><br />or<br /><br />LMWH for 14 days combined with anti-embolism stockings until discharge<br /><br />or<br /><br />Rivaroxaban</td></tr><tr><td>Fragility fractures of the pelvis, hip and proximal femur</td><td>The NICE guidance states the following (our bolding):<br /><br /><div class='bs-callout bs-callout-default'><i><br />Offer VTE prophylaxis for a <b>month</b> to people with fragility fractures of the pelvis, hip or proximal<br />femur if the risk of VTE outweighs the risk of bleeding.

        "body": "Patient with diabetes mellitus have traditionally had their blood pressure controlled more aggressively to help reduce their overall cardiovascular risk. However, a 2013 Cochrane review cast doubt on the wisdom of lower blood pressure targets for patients with diabetes. It compared patients who had tight blood pressure control (targets < 130/85 mmHg) with more relaxed control (< 140-160/90-100 mmHg). Patients who were more tightly controlled had a slightly reduced rate of stroke but otherwise, outcomes were not significantly different.<br /><br />In light of this, NICE recommends a <span class=\"concept\" data-cid=\"604\">blood pressure target of < 140/90 mmHg for type 2 diabetics</span>, the same as for patients without diabetes.<br /><br />For patients with type 1 diabetes, NICE recommends:<br /><br /><div class='bs-callout bs-callout-default'><i><br />Intervention levels for recommending blood pressure management should be <span class=\"concept\" data-cid=\"10779\">135/85 mmHg</span> unless the adult with type 1 diabetes has albuminuria or 2 or more features of metabolic syndrome, in which case it should be 130/80 mmHg<br /></i></div><br />Because <span class=\"concept\" data-cid=\"603\">ACE inhibitors/or angiotensin-II receptor antagonist (A2RBs)</span> have a renoprotective effect in diabetes they are the first-line antihypertensive regardless of age. A2RBs are preferred for black African or African-Caribbean diabetic patients. Further management then reverts to that of non-diabetic patients.<br /><br />Remember that autonomic neuropathy may result in more postural symptoms in patients taking antihypertensive therapy.<br /><br />The routine use of beta-blockers in uncomplicated hypertension should be avoided, particularly when given in combination with thiazides, as they may cause insulin resistance, impair insulin secretion and alter the autonomic response to hypoglycaemia.",

Your FVC is the total volume of air that can be exhaled by the person in one breath. Effectively giving an idea of how much capacity is in a person's lungs.

In this case the young man has lost lots of blood in the initial chest drain (1.7l) and has continued to lose large amounts of blood (220ml/hour) for the next 2 hours. These are both indications for more definitive treatment, a thoracotomy. This will allow for surgical exploration and closure of any actively bleeding sites. <br /><br />Reassessing the patient in an hour is incorrect as he is still bleeding profusely and requires more definitive management.<br /><br />Removing the chest drain will cause the blood to collect around his heart causing a tamponade and so is not recommended in this case. <br /><br />Giving either oral or IV vitamin K may be useful if this man was on warfarin (vitamin K is used in the reversal of warfarin) however this is not the case.",

What is the next best step in the management of this man's haemothorax?",
        "correct_answer": "3",
        "question_notes": "This question is asking about the management of a haemothorax. In this case the young man has lost lots of blood in the initial chest drain (1.7l) and has continued to lose large amounts of blood (220ml/hour) for the next 2 hours. These are both indications for more definitive treatment, a thoracotomy. This will allow for surgical exploration and closure of any actively bleeding sites. <br /><br />Reassessing the patient in an hour is incorrect as he is still bleeding profusely and requires more definitive management.<br /><br />Removing the chest drain will cause the blood to collect around his heart causing a tamponade and so is not recommended in this case. <br /><br />Giving either oral or IV vitamin K may be useful if this man was on warfarin (vitamin K is used in the reversal of warfarin) however this is not the case.",
