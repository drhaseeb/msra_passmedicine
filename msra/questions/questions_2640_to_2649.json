            "<b>Metformin and an SGLT-2 inhibitor</b> is the correct answer. According to the 2022 NICE guidelines (NG28) for the management of type 2 diabetes, initial drug treatment should be tailored based on the patient's comorbidities and cardiovascular risk. For individuals with established atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD), such as this patient with a history of myocardial infarction, dual therapy with metformin and a sodium-glucose co-transporter-2 (SGLT-2) inhibitor should be offered from the outset. This recommendation is based on strong evidence from cardiovascular outcome trials demonstrating that SGLT-2 inhibitors (e.g., empagliflozin, canagliflozin, dapagliflozin) significantly reduce the risk of major adverse cardiovascular events, hospitalisation for heart failure, and progression of renal disease, independent of their glucose-lowering effects. Metformin remains a cornerstone of therapy and should be started and titrated to the maximum tolerated dose, with the SGLT-2 inhibitor introduced alongside it. This proactive approach aims to address both glycaemic control and cardiovascular risk reduction from the point of diagnosis in this high-risk patient.<br /><br /><b>Metformin monotherapy</b> is incorrect in this specific clinical context. While metformin is the standard first-line agent for most people with newly diagnosed type 2 diabetes, this applies to those who do not have established cardiovascular disease, chronic heart failure, or a high risk of developing CVD (QRISK2 score \u226510%). For this patient, who has established ASCVD due to his previous myocardial infarction, initiating metformin alone would be suboptimal management. It would fail to provide the immediate and significant cardiovascular protection offered by an SGLT-2 inhibitor, thereby not aligning with the most current, evidence-based UK guidelines. The guidelines now prioritise cardiovascular and renal risk reduction in addition to glycaemic control.<br /><br /><b>Metformin and a sulfonylurea</b> is an incorrect choice for initial therapy. This combination is a well-established second-line option for patients who are already on metformin monotherapy but are not meeting their agreed HbA1c target (typically when HbA1c rises to 58 mmol/mol or 7.5%). It is not recommended as a first-line combination. Furthermore, sulfonylureas (e.g., gliclazide) are associated with risks of hypoglycaemia and weight gain, and they do not confer the specific cardiovascular benefits that are indicated for this patient. Given the availability of agents with proven cardiovascular outcome benefits, this would not be the most appropriate choice.<br /><br /><b>Metformin and a DPP-4 inhibitor</b> is also an incorrect choice for initial therapy. Similar to sulfonylureas, a dipeptidyl peptidase-4 (DPP-4) inhibitor (e.g., sitagliptin, alogliptin) is typically added as a second-line agent if glycaemic control is not achieved with metformin alone. While DPP-4 inhibitors have the advantage of being weight-neutral with a low risk of hypoglycaemia, they have been shown to be largely neutral in terms of cardiovascular outcomes. They do not provide the significant reduction in cardiovascular events seen with SGLT-2 inhibitors. Therefore, in a patient with known cardiovascular disease, an SGLT-2 inhibitor is the strongly preferred add-on agent to metformin.<br /><br /><b>SGLT-2 inhibitor monotherapy</b> is incorrect because metformin is not contraindicated. This option would be appropriate for a patient with established cardiovascular disease in whom metformin is contraindicated (e.g., severe renal impairment with an eGFR <30 ml/min/1.73m\u00b2) or not tolerated due to side effects. The scenario provides no information to suggest any contraindication to metformin. As metformin is effective, generally safe, and has a robust evidence base, it should be included as part of the first-line regimen unless there is a clear reason to omit it. The optimal approach is therefore combination therapy.",

            "<b>Azithromycin</b> is the correct answer. This patient's presentation is consistent with whooping cough, caused by <i>Bordetella pertussis</i>, with characteristic features including protracted clinical course (often multiple weeks), post-tussive vomiting, subconjunctival haemorrhages, and the textbook 'inspiratory whoop' heard between paroxysms of coughing. <br /><br />Whooping cough should be treated with a macrolide if the onset of cough is within the previous 21 days as antimicrobial pharmacotherapy may shorten the overall disease course.

            "The correct answer is <b>Known thrombogenic mutation</b>. Combined Oral Contraceptive Pill (COCP) use increases the risk of venous thromboembolism (VTE), and this risk is significantly higher in women with known thrombogenic mutations, such as Factor V Leiden or Prothrombin gene mutation. Therefore, the presence of these mutations is an absolute contraindication to COCP use due to the considerably elevated risk of VTE.<br /><br /><b>Family history of thromboembolic disease in first degree relatives < 45 years</b> is not an absolute contraindication but it does warrant further investigation. If a woman has a first-degree relative who had a VTE before 45 years, she should be tested for thrombogenic mutations. If positive, then COCP should not be prescribed; if negative, it can be considered with caution.<br /><br /><b>Hyperlipidaemia</b> itself is not an absolute contraindication to COCP use. However, it's important to note that COCP can affect lipid metabolism and may lead to increased triglyceride levels. Therefore, careful monitoring and consideration are needed when prescribing COCP in women with hyperlipidaemia.<br /><br />The <b>concurrent use of rifampicin</b>, an antibiotic used for tuberculosis treatment among other diseases, is not an absolute contraindication but it does interact with COCPs. Rifampicin induces liver enzymes which can reduce the efficacy of hormonal contraceptives including COCPs. Alternative or additional contraceptive measures should be considered during rifampicin therapy and for 28 days after its discontinuation.<br /><br />Finally, <b>Immobility (e.g. wheelchair use)</b> is not an absolute contraindication for using COCPs either. However, immobility does increase the risk of VTE so careful assessment of overall VTE risk should be undertaken before prescribing a combined pill in these circumstances.<br />",
