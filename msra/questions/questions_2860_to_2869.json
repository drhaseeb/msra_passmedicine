However, combination therapy increases the risk of bleeding and may not be needed in all cases. How should this be managed?<br /><br />Whilst there are not guidelines to cover every scenario a recent review in the BMJ offered an expert opinion outlining the approach in common scenarios.<br /><br />Secondary prevention of stable cardiovascular disease with an indication for an anticoagulant<br /><ul><li>normally in this situation, all patients are recommended to be prescribed an antiplatelet</li><li>if an indication for anticoagulant exists (for example atrial fibrillation) it is indicated that <span class=\"concept\" data-cid=\"1000\">anticoagulant monotherapy is given without the addition of antiplatelets</span></li></ul><br />Post-acute coronary syndrome/percutaneous coronary intervention<br /><ul><li>in these patients, there is a much stronger indication for antiplatelet therapy</li><li>generally patients are given triple therapy (<span class=\"concept\" data-cid=\"1000\">2 antiplatelets + 1 anticoagulant</span>) for 4 weeks-6 months after the event and dual therapy (1 antiplatelet + 1 anticoagulant) to complete 12 months</li><li>there is variation from patient to patient however given that the stroke risk in atrial fibrillation varies according to risk factors.</li></ul><br />Venous thromboembolism (VTE)<br /><ul><li>if a patient on antiplatelets develops a VTE they are likely to be prescribed anticoagulants for 3-6 months</li><li>an ORBIT score should be calculated.

            "The correct answer is <b>Refer for external cephalic version</b>. External cephalic version (ECV) is a procedure that aims to turn the fetus from a breech position into a head-down (cephalic) position. It is recommended by the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) in the UK for women who are at or near term (36 weeks or more) with a breech presentation unless there are contraindications. ECV has been shown to reduce the rate of breech presentation at birth and caesarean section.<br /><br />The option <b>Reassure mother baby will most likely turn to a cephalic presentation prior to delivery</b> is incorrect. While it's true that many babies do spontaneously turn to a cephalic position before birth, by 36 weeks this becomes increasingly unlikely. Therefore, waiting for spontaneous version could potentially increase the risk of complications.<br /><br />The option <b>Admit for induction of labour and trial of vaginal delivery</b> is also incorrect. Induction of labour in breech presentation is not routinely recommended due to increased risks including cord prolapse, fetal distress, and difficult delivery which may lead to birth trauma.<br /><br /><b>Refer for radiological pelvimetry</b> isn't the best choice either. Pelvimetry, which measures the size and shape of the woman's pelvis using imaging techniques, was historically used in cases of breech presentation but it's no longer routinely recommended as it doesn't reliably predict successful vaginal delivery.<br /><br />Lastly, <b>Admit for caesarean section</b> wouldn't be the first-line management according to current guidelines. Although caesarean section can be considered if ECV fails or isn't suitable, it would not be performed without attempting an ECV first given that there's still time before term.<br />",
