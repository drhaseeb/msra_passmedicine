            "The correct answer, in this case, is <b>guttate psoriasis</b>. Guttate psoriasis is a type of psoriasis characterized by the sudden onset of small, erythematous, scaly lesions that are typically less than 1 cm in diameter. It is commonly triggered by a preceding streptococcal infection, such as exudative tonsillitis as noted in the patient's history. The widespread distribution of the rash over the torso and limbs also supports this diagnosis.<br /><br /><b>Pityriasis rosea</b> is an incorrect option because it typically presents with a single, larger 'herald patch' followed by smaller oval lesions along skin cleavage lines. Although it can affect the trunk and proximal extremities, it does not usually present with multiple erythematous lesions less than 1 cm in diameter.<br /><br /><b>Pityriasis versicolor</b> is another incorrect option. This condition is caused by an overgrowth of <i>Malassezia</i> yeast on the skin and presents with hypopigmented or hyperpigmented scaly macules that coalesce to form patches. Pityriasis versicolor does not present with small erythematous lesions and is not associated with a preceding streptococcal infection.<br /><br /><b>Syphilis</b> would be an unlikely diagnosis in this scenario. While secondary syphilis can present with a widespread rash involving the trunk and extremities, it typically manifests as non-pruritic, symmetric maculopapular eruptions rather than small erythematous lesions covered by fine scales. Additionally, there is no mention of other symptoms suggestive of syphilis such as genital or oral ulcers.<br /><br />Finally, <b>discoid eczema</b>, also known as nummular dermatitis, is characterized by well-demarcated circular or oval plaques with erythema, scaling, and sometimes oozing or crusting. The distribution of the rash can be widespread but usually presents as larger lesions rather than multiple small erythematous lesions less than 1 cm in diameter.",

            "The correct answer is '<b>Increases endogenous insulin secretion</b>'. Metformin, a first-line treatment for type 2 diabetes mellitus, does not increase endogenous insulin secretion. Its primary mechanism of action involves decreasing hepatic gluconeogenesis and increasing peripheral insulin sensitivity, but it doesn't stimulate the pancreas to secrete more insulin.<br /><br />Discussing the incorrect options:<br /><br />'<b>Does not cause hypoglycaemia</b>' is a true statement about metformin. Unlike sulfonylureas or insulin, metformin does not directly stimulate insulin release; therefore, it does not typically cause hypoglycaemia when used alone.<br /><br />'<b>Increases insulin sensitivity</b>' is also accurate. One of the main actions of metformin is to increase the peripheral tissues' sensitivity to insulin. This allows these tissues to better use any available insulin and thereby helps lower blood glucose levels.<br /><br />'<b>Decreases hepatic gluconeogenesis</b>' is another correct statement. Metformin's primary mechanism of action is reducing liver glucose production by inhibiting gluconeogenesis and glycogenolysis. This leads to a decrease in circulating glucose concentrations.<br /><br />Finally, '<b>Reduces GI absorption of carbohydrates</b>' is also true about metformin.

            "<b>Minimal change disease</b> is the correct answer. This patient is presenting with the classic features of nephrotic syndrome: peripheral oedema, heavy proteinuria, and hypoalbuminaemia. Minimal change disease (MCD) is the most common cause of nephrotic syndrome in children (accounting for over 75% of cases) but it also accounts for approximately 25% of cases in adults. Crucially, it is the most common cause of idiopathic nephrotic syndrome in young adults. The presentation with acute onset, profound oedema, preserved renal function, and normotension is highly characteristic of MCD. Although a renal biopsy is required for definitive diagnosis in adults, MCD is the most probable underlying pathology in this specific demographic and clinical context. Management is typically with high-dose oral corticosteroids, to which the majority of patients respond well.<br /><br /><b>Focal segmental glomerulosclerosis</b> (FSGS) is a very important differential diagnosis and a leading cause of nephrotic syndrome in adults. However, while it can present in young adults, it is statistically less common than MCD in this specific age group for a primary presentation of nephrotic syndrome. Furthermore, patients with FSGS are more likely to present with hypertension and impaired renal function at diagnosis compared to the normotension and normal creatinine seen in this case. While it remains a key differential to be excluded on biopsy, the classic, uncomplicated nephrotic syndrome picture in a 20-year-old makes MCD more likely.<br /><br /><b>IgA nephropathy</b> is the most common primary glomerulonephritis worldwide. The classic presentation is with episodic macroscopic haematuria, often following an upper respiratory tract infection. While it can present with nephrotic-range proteinuria (seen in about 10% of cases), this is an atypical presentation. The absence of any mention of haematuria (macroscopic or microscopic) in the scenario makes IgA nephropathy a less likely diagnosis than primary causes of nephrotic syndrome like MCD.<br /><br /><b>Membranoproliferative glomerulonephritis</b> (MPGN) typically presents with a mixed nephrotic-nephritic syndrome. This means patients often have features of both, including oedema and proteinuria, but also hypertension, haematuria, and renal impairment. It is also frequently associated with low serum complement levels. The patient in this scenario has a pure nephrotic picture with normotension and normal renal function, making MPGN less probable.<br /><br /><b>Membranous glomerulonephritis</b> is the most common cause of primary nephrotic syndrome in the non-diabetic <i>overall</i> adult population. However, this statistic is heavily influenced by its higher incidence in older adults, typically those over the age of 40. In a 20-year-old, it is a less common cause than both minimal change disease and FSGS.

        "title": "Mental Capacity Act",
        "body": "The Mental Capacity Act of 2005 came into force in 2007. It applies to adults over the age of 16 and sets out who can take decisions if a patient becomes incapacitated (e.g. following a stroke). Mental capacity includes the ability to make decisions affecting daily life, healthcare and financial issues. <br /><br />The Act contains 5 key principles:<br /><ul><li>A person must be assumed to have capacity unless it is established that he lacks capacity</li><li>A person is not to be treated as unable to make a decision unless all practicable steps to help him to do so have been taken without success</li><li>A person is not to be treated as unable to make a decision merely because he makes an unwise decision</li><li>An act done, or decision made, under this Act for or on behalf of a person who lacks capacity must be done, or made, in his best interests</li><li>Before the act is done, or the decision is made, regard must be had to whether the purpose for which it is needed can be as effectively achieved in a way that is less restrictive of the person's rights and freedom of action</li></ul><br /><h5 class='notes-heading'>Assessment of capacity</h5><br />The Act sets out a clear test for assessing whether a person lacks capacity. It is a 'decision-specific' and 'time-specific' test. An adult can only be considered unable to make a particular decision if:<br /><br />1. He or she has an 'impairment of, or disturbance in, the functioning of the mind or<br />brain' whether permanent or temporary AND<br /><br />2. He or she is unable to undertake any of the following<br /><ul><li>a. understand the information relevant to the decision</li><li>b. retain that information</li><li>c. use or weigh that information as part of the process of making the decision</li><li>d. communicate the decision made by talking, sign language or other means</li></ul><br />No individual can be labelled 'incapable' simply as a result of a particular medical condition. Section 2 of the Act makes it clear that a lack of capacity cannot be assumed by a person's age, appearance, or any condition or aspect of a person's behaviour<br /><br /><h5 class='notes-heading'>Best interests</h5><br />The following should be considered when assessing what is in someone's best interests:<br /><ul><li>1. Whether the person is likely to regain capacity and can the decision wait.</li><li>2. How to encourage and optimise the participation of the person in the decision.</li><li>3. The past and present wishes, feelings, beliefs, values of the person and any other relevant factors</li><li>4. Views of other relevant people</li></ul><br /><h5 class='notes-heading'>Lasting Powers of Attorney (LPAs)</h5><br />The Act allows a person to appoint an attorney to act on their behalf if they should lose capacity in the future, replacing the current Enduring Power of Attorney (EPA). In addition to property and financial affairs the Act also allows people to empower an attorney make health and welfare decisions. The attorney only has the authority to make decisions about life-sustaining treatment if the LPA specifies that. Before it can be used an LPA must be registered with the Office of the Public Guardian<br /><br /><h5 class='notes-heading'>Advance decisions</h5><br />Advance decisions can be drawn up by anybody with capacity to specify treatments they would not want if they lost capacity. They may be made verbally unless they specify refusing life-sustaining treatment (e.g. Ventilation) in which case they need to be written, signed and witnessed to be valid. Advance decisions cannot demand treatment",

            "<b>Streptococcus pneumoniae</b> is the correct answer. This is the most common cause of community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) in adults. The clinical presentation in the scenario is classic for pneumococcal pneumonia. Key features include the sudden onset of symptoms, high fever, productive cough, and pleuritic chest pain, which suggests inflammation of the pleura adjacent to the consolidated lung tissue. The chest X-ray finding of consolidation confined to a single lobe (lobar pneumonia) is a hallmark of this organism. Furthermore, the presence of a cold sore (herpes labialis) is a well-recognised association with pneumococcal infection, thought to be due to reactivation of the herpes simplex virus during the febrile illness. While other organisms can cause CAP, this specific constellation of features makes <i>Streptococcus pneumoniae</i> the most probable pathogen.<br /><br /><b>Haemophilus influenzae</b> is another common cause of CAP, particularly in patients with underlying chronic respiratory conditions such as COPD, bronchiectasis, or in those who are unvaccinated. While it can present with fever and cough, the presentation is often less acute than that of pneumococcal pneumonia. It typically causes a bronchopneumonia pattern on chest X-ray (patchy consolidation) rather than the classic lobar pattern described in this case. The absence of any underlying respiratory disease in the history also makes this diagnosis less likely than <i>S. pneumoniae</i>.<br /><br /><b>Klebsiella pneumoniae</b> is an important but less common cause of CAP in the UK. It classically affects individuals with comorbidities, particularly alcohol dependency, diabetes mellitus, or malignancy. The pneumonia it causes is often severe and destructive, with a predilection for the upper lobes. The X-ray may show a 'bulging fissure' sign due to the copious inflammatory exudate. The patient in this scenario has no mentioned risk factors, and the consolidation is in the lower lobe, making this diagnosis less likely.<br /><br /><b>Mycoplasma pneumoniae</b> is a leading cause of 'atypical' pneumonia, which is more common in younger adults and children. The presentation is typically more insidious, with a gradual onset of a dry, persistent cough, headache, and myalgia over several days. High fevers and pleuritic pain are less common. Chest X-ray findings usually show diffuse, patchy interstitial infiltrates rather than dense lobar consolidation. The acute, severe presentation with lobar consolidation makes this diagnosis unlikely.<br /><br /><b>Staphylococcus aureus</b> is a recognised cause of CAP, but it is relatively uncommon in otherwise healthy adults. It is most characteristically seen as a secondary bacterial infection following an influenza virus infection. Staphylococcal pneumonia is often severe and can be complicated by cavitation, abscess formation, or empyema. The patient has no history of a preceding flu-like illness, and the X-ray does not describe these more destructive features, making this a less probable cause than <i>S. pneumoniae</i>.",

        "body": "In a breech presentation the caudal end of the fetus occupies the lower segment. Whilst around 25% of pregnancies at 28 weeks are breech it only occurs in 3% of babies near term. A frank breech is the most common presentation with the hips flexed and knees fully extended. A footling breech, where one or both feet come first with the bottom at a higher position, is rare but carries a higher perinatal morbidity<br /><br />Risk factors for breech presentation<br /><ul><li>uterine malformations, fibroids</li><li>placenta praevia</li><li>polyhydramnios or oligohydramnios</li><li>fetal abnormality (e.g. CNS malformation, chromosomal disorders)</li><li>prematurity (due to increased incidence earlier in gestation)</li></ul><br />Cord prolapse is more common in breech presentations<br /><br />Management<br /><ul><li>if < 36 weeks: many fetuses will turn spontaneously</li><li>if still breech at 36 weeks NICE recommend external cephalic version (ECV)- this has a success rate of around 60%. The RCOG recommend ECV should be offered from 36 weeks in nulliparous women and from 37 weeks in multiparous women</li><li>if the baby is still breech then delivery options include planned caesarean section or vaginal delivery</li></ul><br />Information to help decision making - the RCOG recommend:<br /><ul><li>'Women should be informed that planned caesarean section carries a reduced perinatal mortality and early neonatal morbidity for babies with a breech presentation at term compared with planned vaginal birth.'</li><li>'Women should be informed that there is no evidence that the long term health of babies with a breech presentation delivered at term is influenced by how the baby is born.'</li></ul><br />RCOG absolute contraindications to ECV:<br /><ul><li>where caesarean delivery is required</li><li>antepartum haemorrhage within the last 7 days</li><li>abnormal cardiotocography</li><li>major uterine anomaly</li><li>ruptured membranes</li><li>multiple pregnancy</li></ul>",
