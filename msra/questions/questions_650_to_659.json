            "The correct answer is '<b>Children who received another live vaccine 2 weeks ago can safely have MMR</b>'. According to the UK guidelines, if a child has recently been given another live attenuated vaccine, there should be a minimum gap of four weeks before the MMR vaccine is administered. This is to ensure that the immune response to one vaccine does not interfere with the response to the other.<br /><br />The statement '<b>Malaise, fever and rash may occur after around one week</b>' is correct. These are common mild side effects following MMR vaccination. They usually occur 6-10 days after vaccination but are generally transient and self-limiting.<br /><br />'<b>Allergy to neomycin is a contraindication</b>' is also correct. The MMR vaccine contains a small amount of neomycin, an antibiotic that some people may be allergic to. If someone has had an allergic reaction (anaphylaxis) to neomycin in the past, they should not receive the MMR vaccine.<br /><br />The statement '<b>The second dose is given at 3-4 years</b>' is accurate as per UK immunisation schedule. The first dose of MMR is usually given within a month of the child's first birthday and then a second dose before starting school at around 3 years and 4 months.<br /><br />Lastly, it's true that '<b>MMR is a live attenuated vaccine</b>'. The measles, mumps and rubella components of the MMR vaccine are all 'live' viruses that have been weakened (attenuated), so they cannot cause full-blown disease in individuals with healthy immune systems.<br />",

According to the British Thoracic Society guidelines, intravenous magnesium sulphate is recommended for adults with acute severe asthma who have not responded adequately to initial treatment with oxygen, nebulised short-acting beta2-agonists and steroids.

        "body": "The basic classification of epilepsy has changed in recent years. The new basic seizure classification is based on 3 key features:<br /><ul><li>1. Where seizures begin in the brain</li><li>2. Level of awareness during a seizure (important as can affect safety during seizure)</li><li>3. Other features of seizures</li></ul><br />Focal seizures<br /><ul><li>previously termed partial seizures</li><li>these start in a specific area, on one side of the brain</li><li>the <span class=\"concept\" data-cid=\"1795\">level of awareness</span> can vary in focal seizures. The terms <span class=\"concept\" data-cid=\"8721\">focal aware</span> (previously termed 'simple partial'), <span class=\"concept\" data-cid=\"8720\">focal impaired awareness</span> (previously termed 'complex partial') and awareness unknown are used to further describe focal seizures</li><li>further to this, focal seizures can be classified as being motor (e.g. Jacksonian march), non-motor (e.g. dej\u00c3\u00a0 vu, jamais vu; ) or having other features such as aura</li></ul><br />Generalised<br /><ul><li>these engage or involve networks on both sides of the brain at the onset</li><li>consciousness lost immediately. The level of awareness in the above classification is therefore not needed, as all patients lose consciousness</li><li>generalised seizures can be further subdivided into motor (e.g. tonic-clonic) and non-motor (e.g. absence)</li><li>specific types include:<ul><li><span class=\"concept\" data-cid=\"8722\">tonic-clonic (grand mal)</span></li><li>tonic</li><li>clonic</li><li><span class=\"concept\" data-cid=\"8723\">typical absence (petit mal)</span></li><li><span class=\"concept\" data-cid=\"8725\">atonic</span></li></ul></li></ul><br />Unknown onset<br /><ul><li>this termed is reserved for when the origin of the seizure is unknown</li></ul><br />Focal to bilateral seizure<br /><ul><li>starts on one side of the brain in a specific area before spreading to both lobes</li><li>previously termed secondary generalized seizures</li></ul>",
