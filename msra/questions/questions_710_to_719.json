            "The correct answer to this question is <b>Tongue biting</b>. True seizures, also known as epileptic seizures, often involve involuntary muscle contractions which can result in tongue biting. This is a common feature of generalised tonic-clonic seizures where there is a loss of consciousness and violent muscle contractions. In contrast, pseudoseizures or non-epileptic attack disorder (NEAD), do not typically present with tongue biting. NEAD are psychological in origin and mimic epileptic seizures but do not involve abnormal electrical activity in the brain.<br /><br />The option <b>Gradual onset</b> is incorrect as it is more suggestive of pseudoseizures rather than true seizures. Epileptic seizures usually have an abrupt onset while NEAD may have a more gradual onset.<br /><br /><b>Female sex</b> is also an incorrect answer. While it's true that NEAD tends to be more common among females, the gender of the patient does not help distinguish between true seizures and pseudoseizures.<br /><br />The option <b>Family member with epilepsy</b> might seem like a potential indicator for true seizures due to the genetic component involved in some forms of epilepsy. However, having a family member with epilepsy doesn't necessarily mean that an individual will experience true seizures themselves. Therefore, it cannot be considered as the most strong factor suggesting true seizures over pseudoseizures.<br /><br />Lastly, <b>Pelvic thrusting</b> is usually associated with pseudoseizures rather than true seizures. It's one of the physical manifestations that can occur during NEAD but isn't typically seen in epileptic seizure episodes.<br />",

In pre-menopausal women with early breast cancer that is oestrogen receptor (ER) positive and HER2 negative, tamoxifen is the first-line adjuvant endocrine therapy according to NICE guidelines. Tamoxifen is a selective oestrogen receptor modulator (SERM) that acts as an antagonist in breast tissue, blocking the effects of oestrogen on cancer cells.

        "title": "Breast cancer: management",
        "body": "The management of breast cancer depends on the staging, tumour type and patient background. It may involve any of the following:<br /><ul><li>surgery</li><li>radiotherapy</li><li>hormone therapy</li><li>biological therapy</li><li>chemotherapy</li></ul><br /><h5 class='notes-heading'>Surgery</h5><br />The vast majority of patients who have breast cancer diagnosed will be offered surgery. An exception may be a very frail, elderly lady with metastatic disease who may be better managed with hormonal therapy.<br /><br />Prior to surgery, the presence/absence of axillary lymphadenopathy determines management:<br /><ul><li><span class=\"concept\" data-cid=\"10185\">women with no palpable axillary lymphadenopathy at presentation should have a pre-operative axillary ultrasound</span> before their primary surgery<ul><li><span class=\"concept\" data-cid=\"10186\">if negative then they should have a sentinel node biopsy to assess the nodal burden</span></li></ul></li><li><span class=\"concept\" data-cid=\"10189\">in patients with breast cancer who present with clinically palpable lymphadenopathy, axillary node clearance is indicated at primary surgery</span><ul><li><span class=\"concept\" data-cid=\"10191\">this may lead to arm lymphedema and functional arm impairment</span></li></ul></li></ul><br />Depending on the characteristics of the tumour women either have a wide-local excision or a mastectomy. Around two-thirds of tumours can be removed with a wide-local excision. The table below lists some of the factors determining which operation is offered:<br /><br /><div class=\"table-responsive\"><table class = \"tlarge table table-striped table-bordered\"  data-role=\"table\" id=\"tableid1\" ><thead><tr><th><b>Mastectomy</b></th><th><b>Wide Local Excision</b></th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Multifocal tumour</td><td>Solitary lesion</td></tr><tr><td>Central tumour</td><td>Peripheral tumour</td></tr><tr><td>Large lesion in small breast</td><td>Small lesion in large breast</td></tr><tr><td>DCIS > 4cm</td><td>DCIS < 4cm</td></tr></tbody></table></div><br />Women should be offered breast reconstruction to achieve a cosmetically suitable result regardless of the type of operation they have. For women who've had a mastectomy this may be done at the initial operation or at a later date.<br /><br /><h5 class='notes-heading'>Radiotherapy</h5><br /><span class=\"concept\" data-cid=\"9151\">Whole breast radiotherapy is recommended after a woman has had a wide-local excision as this may reduce the risk of recurrence by around two-thirds</span>. For women who've had a mastectomy radiotherapy is offered for T3-T4 tumours and for those with four or more positive axillary nodes<br /><br /><h5 class='notes-heading'>Hormonal therapy</h5><br />Adjuvant hormonal therapy is offered if tumours are positive for hormone receptors. For many years this was done using tamoxifen for 5 years after diagnosis. <span class=\"concept\" data-cid=\"3967\">Tamoxifen is still used in pre- and peri-menopausal women</span>. In <span class=\"concept\" data-cid=\"1261\">post-menopausal women, aromatase inhibitors such as anastrozole</span> are used for this purpose*. This is important as aromatisation accounts for the majority of oestrogen production in post-menopausal women and therefore anastrozole is used for ER +ve breast cancer in this group. <br /><br />Important side effects of tamoxifen include an increased risk of endometrial cancer, venous thromboembolism and menopausal symptoms.<br /><br /><h5 class='notes-heading'>Biological therapy</h5><br />The most common type of biological therapy used for breast cancer is <span class=\"concept\" data-cid=\"3966\">trastuzumab (Herceptin)</span>. It is only useful in the 20-25% of tumours that are <span class=\"concept\" data-cid=\"3966\">HER2 positive</span>.<br /><br />Trastuzumab cannot be used in patients with a history of heart disorders.<br /><br /><h5 class='notes-heading'>Chemotherapy</h5><br />Cytotoxic therapy may be used either prior to surgery ('neoadjuvanant' chemotherapy) to <span class=\"concept\" data-cid=\"10193\">downstage a primary lesion</span> or after surgery depending on the stage of the tumour, for example, if there is <span class=\"concept\" data-cid=\"3968\">axillary node disease - FEC-D is used in this situation</span>.",

            "The correct answer in this case is the <b>Intrauterine system (Mirena)</b>. This is because the patient has a history of heavy menstrual bleeding without any other concerning symptoms, and she does not wish to have more children. The Mirena intrauterine system releases levonorgestrel, which causes endometrial thinning and reduces menstrual blood loss. It is also a long-acting reversible contraceptive method that can be used for up to five years.<br /><br />The first option, <b>Hysterectomy</b>, would be considered an overly aggressive treatment for this patient's presentation. Hysterectomy involves the surgical removal of the uterus and is typically reserved for cases where more conservative treatments have failed or are contraindicated, or if there are other significant gynaecological issues present.<br /><br />The second option, <b>Combined oral contraceptive pill</b>, could potentially help manage heavy menstrual bleeding by regulating the menstrual cycle and reducing blood loss. However, it may not be as effective as the Mirena intrauterine system in addressing both her heavy periods and her desire for contraception.<br /><br />The third option, <b>Endometrial ablation</b>, involves removing or destroying a thin layer of the endometrium to reduce menstrual blood loss. This treatment may be suitable for some women with heavy periods but should only be considered after other less invasive options have been tried. Additionally, endometrial ablation may not be appropriate in this case since it is less reliable as a contraceptive method compared to Mirena.<br /><br />Lastly, <b>Tranexamic acid</b> is an antifibrinolytic medication that helps reduce bleeding by stabilizing blood clots. It can be used as a short-term treatment for heavy periods but does not provide any contraceptive benefits. As such, it would not address both of the patient's concerns - reducing her heavy periods and preventing future pregnancies.<br /><br />In summary, the Intrauterine system (Mirena) is the most appropriate treatment choice for this patient, as it effectively addresses both her heavy periods and contraceptive needs.

SUFE affects children in their early teens (older than the boy in this scenario) and is associated with obesity.
