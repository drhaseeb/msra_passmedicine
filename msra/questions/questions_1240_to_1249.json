            "The correct answer is <b>Topical clobetasone butyrate</b>. Lichen planus is a chronic inflammatory condition that affects the skin, mucous membranes and nails. It presents with flat-topped papules that are often itchy. Topical corticosteroids like clobetasone butyrate are the first-line treatment for cutaneous lichen planus according to UK guidelines. They reduce inflammation and alleviate itching by inhibiting cytokine production and suppressing eosinophil action.<br /><br />Moving onto the incorrect answers, <b>Refer for punch biopsy</b> is not the most appropriate initial step in management. While a biopsy can be used to confirm a diagnosis of lichen planus if there's uncertainty, it's typically only performed after an initial trial of treatment or if there's suspicion of malignancy (which would be unusual in this case).<br /><br /><b>Emollients + oral antihistamine</b> could provide symptomatic relief from itching but do not address the underlying inflammation causing the symptoms. Emollients moisturise the skin while antihistamines block histamine receptors to reduce itchiness. However, they do not treat the condition itself.<br /><br /><b>Topical dapsone</b> is primarily used for dermatitis herpetiformis and other neutrophilic dermatoses, not lichen planus. Dapsone has anti-inflammatory properties and can be effective against certain skin conditions, but its use should be restricted due to potential side effects including haemolysis and methaemoglobinaemia.<br /><br />Finally, <b>Topical clotrimazole</b> is an antifungal medication often used to treat conditions such as athlete's foot or thrush. It works by disrupting fungal cell membrane synthesis but has no role in treating lichen planus which is an inflammatory rather than infectious condition.<br />",

        "question_notes": "The correct answer is <b>Topical clobetasone butyrate</b>. Lichen planus is a chronic inflammatory condition that affects the skin, mucous membranes and nails. It presents with flat-topped papules that are often itchy. Topical corticosteroids like clobetasone butyrate are the first-line treatment for cutaneous lichen planus according to UK guidelines. They reduce inflammation and alleviate itching by inhibiting cytokine production and suppressing eosinophil action.<br /><br />Moving onto the incorrect answers, <b>Refer for punch biopsy</b> is not the most appropriate initial step in management. While a biopsy can be used to confirm a diagnosis of lichen planus if there's uncertainty, it's typically only performed after an initial trial of treatment or if there's suspicion of malignancy (which would be unusual in this case).<br /><br /><b>Emollients + oral antihistamine</b> could provide symptomatic relief from itching but do not address the underlying inflammation causing the symptoms. Emollients moisturise the skin while antihistamines block histamine receptors to reduce itchiness. However, they do not treat the condition itself.<br /><br /><b>Topical dapsone</b> is primarily used for dermatitis herpetiformis and other neutrophilic dermatoses, not lichen planus. Dapsone has anti-inflammatory properties and can be effective against certain skin conditions, but its use should be restricted due to potential side effects including haemolysis and methaemoglobinaemia.<br /><br />Finally, <b>Topical clotrimazole</b> is an antifungal medication often used to treat conditions such as athlete's foot or thrush. It works by disrupting fungal cell membrane synthesis but has no role in treating lichen planus which is an inflammatory rather than infectious condition.<br />",

            "The correct answer is <b>Terlipressin</b>. Terlipressin is a synthetic analogue of vasopressin and acts as a vasoconstrictor. It reduces portal venous pressure by causing splanchnic vasoconstriction, which can help control variceal bleeding. According to the British Society of Gastroenterology guidelines, terlipressin should be administered as soon as variceal bleeding is suspected and continued until an endoscopy can be performed.<br /><br />The first incorrect option is <b>Octreotide</b>. Octreotide is a somatostatin analogue that also causes splanchnic vasoconstriction. However, its use in acute variceal bleeding is not recommended by UK guidelines due to less robust evidence compared to terlipressin.<br /><br /><b>Omeprazole</b> is another incorrect choice. Omeprazole is a proton pump inhibitor (PPI) used primarily for peptic ulcer disease or gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD). While PPIs can reduce gastric acid secretion and potentially lessen the severity of gastric varices, they do not have an effect on oesophageal varices and are therefore not the best choice in this scenario.<br /><br />The third incorrect option is <b>Propranolol</b>. Propranolol is a non-selective beta blocker that decreases portal venous pressure and can be used for primary prophylaxis against variceal bleeding in patients with cirrhosis. However, it does not have an immediate onset of action and hence would not be appropriate for acute management of oesophageal varices.<br /><br />Lastly, <b>Tranexamic acid</b> would also not be suitable. Tranexamic acid inhibits fibrinolysis and helps control bleeding but has no effect on portal hypertension or oesophageal varices specifically. It's more commonly used for heavy menstrual bleeding or postpartum haemorrhage rather than gastrointestinal bleeds.",
