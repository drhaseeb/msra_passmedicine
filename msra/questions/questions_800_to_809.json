            "The correct answer is <b>Furosemide</b>. Furosemide is a loop diuretic commonly used in the management of heart failure and hypertension. One of its well-recognised side effects is ototoxicity, which can manifest as tinnitus and hearing loss. This effect is usually reversible upon discontinuation of the medication but can be permanent in some cases. It's also worth noting that these symptoms are more likely to occur with rapid intravenous administration and high doses.<br /><br /><b>Lofepramine</b> is a tricyclic antidepressant (TCA). While TCAs have numerous side effects due to their anticholinergic properties, they are not typically associated with tinnitus or hearing loss. Common side effects include dry mouth, constipation, urinary retention, blurred vision, postural hypotension and sedation.<br /><br /><b>Ezetimibe</b> works by reducing the amount of cholesterol absorbed by your body from your diet. Its common side effects include diarrhoea, flatulence and upper respiratory tract infection. Tinnitus and hearing loss are not typical adverse reactions to this drug.<br /><br /><b>Tramadol</b> is an opioid analgesic used for moderate to severe pain control. While it may cause several central nervous system-related side effects like dizziness, headache, somnolence and even seizures at high doses; ototoxicity is not one of them.<br /><br />Finally, <b>Digoxin</b>, a cardiac glycoside used primarily in heart failure and atrial fibrillation, has a narrow therapeutic index with many potential side effects including arrhythmias, nausea/vomiting/diarrhoea and visual disturbances such as yellow-green halos around lights.

            "<b>Wolff-Parkinson-White syndrome</b> is the correct diagnosis. This is an arrhythmia caused by a congenital accessory pathway (the bundle of Kent) that bypasses the atrioventricular (AV) node, directly connecting the atria and ventricles. This pre-excitation of the ventricles leads to the classic ECG triad described in the scenario: a short PR interval (<0.12s) as the AV nodal delay is bypassed; a wide QRS complex (>0.12s) because the ventricular depolarisation starts in the myocardium rather than the rapid His-Purkinje system; and a slurred upstroke of the QRS complex, known as a 'delta wave', which represents this initial slow myocardial depolarisation. Patients typically present in their teens or twenties with palpitations, which can be due to atrioventricular re-entrant tachycardia (AVRT). The most significant risk is the rapid conduction of atrial fibrillation through the accessory pathway, which can degenerate into ventricular fibrillation and cause sudden cardiac death.<br /><br /><b>Atrioventricular nodal re-entrant tachycardia</b> (AVNRT) is the most common type of supraventricular tachycardia and a key differential for palpitations in a young person. It is caused by a re-entry circuit within or adjacent to the AV node. However, the resting ECG in a patient with a predisposition to AVNRT is typically normal, with a normal PR interval and narrow QRS complexes. The ECG features of a short PR interval and a delta wave are not characteristic of AVNRT, making this diagnosis less likely despite the similar presenting complaint.<br /><br /><b>Hypertrophic obstructive cardiomyopathy</b> (HOCM) is an important cause of palpitations and sudden cardiac death in the young. While it is associated with Wolff-Parkinson-White syndrome, the characteristic ECG findings for HOCM itself include features of left ventricular hypertrophy (e.g., increased R wave amplitude in left-sided leads and S wave depth in right-sided leads), deep T-wave inversions ('dagger-like' Q waves) in the inferolateral leads, and left atrial enlargement. The specific combination of a short PR interval and a delta wave is not a primary feature of HOCM.<br /><br /><b>Brugada syndrome</b> is an inherited cardiac channelopathy that increases the risk of ventricular tachyarrhythmias and sudden cardiac death. The diagnosis is made based on a characteristic ECG pattern, specifically a coved ST-segment elevation of \u22652 mm followed by a negative T-wave in one or more of the right precordial leads (V1-V3). The ECG findings in the clinical scenario do not match this pattern. Patients may present with syncope or palpitations, but the described ECG is not consistent with this diagnosis.<br /><br /><b>Long QT syndrome</b> is another inherited channelopathy that predisposes individuals to ventricular arrhythmias, particularly Torsades de Pointes, which can cause palpitations, syncope, or sudden death. As the name suggests, the key diagnostic feature on the ECG is a prolonged corrected QT interval (QTc). The ECG findings of a short PR interval and a delta wave are not features of Long QT syndrome, making this diagnosis incorrect.",

        "body": "Stomas may be sited during a range of abdominal procedures and involve bringing the lumen or visceral contents onto the skin. In most cases, this applies to the bowel. However, other organs or their contents may be diverted in case of need. <br /><br />With bowel stomas, the type method of construction and to a lesser extent the site will be determined by the contents of the bowel. In practice, small bowel stomas should be spouted so that their irritant contents are not in contact with the skin. Colonic stomas do not need to be spouted as their contents are less irritant. <br /><br />In the ideal situation, the site of the stoma should be marked with the patient prior to surgery. Stoma siting is important as it will ultimately influence the ability of the patient to manage their stoma and also reduce the risk of leakage. Leakage of stoma contents and subsequent maceration of the surrounding skin can rapidly progress into a spiralling loss of control of stoma contents. <br /><br /><h5 class='notes-heading'>Types of stomas</h5><br />Rule of thumb:<br /><br /><div class=\"table-responsive\"><table class = \"tlarge table table-striped table-bordered\"  data-role=\"table\" id=\"tableid1\" ><thead><tr><th></th><th><span class=\"concept\" data-cid=\"5484\">Ileostomy</span></th><th><span class=\"concept\" data-cid=\"11358\">Colostomy</span></th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td><b>Location</b></td><td>Right iliac fossa</td><td>Varies, more likely on the left side of the abdomen</td></tr><tr><td><b>Appearance</b></td><td>Spouted</td><td>Flushed</td></tr><tr><td><b>Output</b></td><td>Liquid</td><td>Solid</td></tr></tbody></table></div><br />More detail:<br /><br /><div class=\"table-responsive\"><table class = \"tlarge table table-striped table-bordered\"  data-role=\"table\" id=\"tableid2\" ><thead><tr><th><b>Name of stoma</b></th><th><b>Use</b></th><th><b>Common sites</b></th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Gastrostomy</td><td><ul><li>Gastric decompression or fixation</li><li>Feeding</td><td>Epigastrium</td></tr><tr><td></li></ul>Loop jejunostomy</td><td><ul><li>Seldom used as very high output</li><li>May be used following emergency laparotomy with planned early closure</td><td>Any location according to need</td></tr><tr><td></li></ul>Percutaneous jejunostomy</td><td><ul><li>Usually performed for feeding purposes and site in the proximal bowel</td><td>Usually left upper quadrant</td></tr><tr><td></li></ul><span class=\"concept\" data-cid=\"2264\">Loop ileostomy</span></td><td><ul><li>Defunctioning of colon e.g. following rectal cancer surgery</li><li>Does not decompress colon (if ileocaecal valve competent)</td><td>Usually right iliac fossa</td></tr><tr><td></li></ul>End ilestomy</td><td><ul><li>Usually following complete excision of colon or where ileocolic anastomosis is not planned</li><li>May be used to defunction colon, but reversal is more difficult</td><td>Usually right iliac fossa</td></tr><tr><td></li></ul>End colostomy</td><td>Where a colon is diverted or resected and anastomosis is not primarily achievable or desirable</td><td>Either left or right iliac fossa<br />&nbsp;</td></tr><tr><td><span class=\"concept\" data-cid=\"2263\">Loop colostomy</span></td><td><ul><li>To defunction a distal segment of colon</li><li>Since both lumens are present the distal lumen acts as a vent</td><td>May be located in any region of the abdomen, depending upon colonic segment used</td></tr><tr><td></li></ul>Caecostomy</td><td>Stoma of last resort where loop colostomy is not possible</td><td>Right iliac fossa</td></tr><tr><td>Mucous fistula</td><td><ul><li>To decompress a distal segment of bowel following colonic division or resection</li><li>Where closure of a distal resection margin is not safe or achievable</td><td>May be located in any region of the abdomen according to clinical need</td></tr></tbody></table></div></li></ul><br /><h5 class='notes-heading'>Complications</h5><br />Early complications (days post-op)<br /><ul><li>Bleeding</li><li>Ischaemia/necrosis \u2013 dusky, black stoma (urgent)</li><li><span class=\"concept\" data-cid=\"12438\">Retraction</span> \u2013 stoma sits below skin surface \u2192 leakage, skin irritation</li><li>Peristomal skin irritation \u2013 effluent contact</li><li>High-output stoma (ileostomies) \u2192 dehydration, electrolyte loss</li><li>Infection \u2013 wound or peristomal abscess</li></ul><br />Late complications (weeks\u2013years)<br /><ul><li>Parastomal hernia \u2013 most common long-term</li><li>Stenosis/stricture \u2013 poor effluent flow, obstruction</li><li>Prolapse \u2013 bowel telescopes through stoma</li><li>Chronic retraction \u2013 persistent, hard to fit appliances</li><li>Fistula formation</li><li>Psychological issues \u2013 body image, odour, social impact</li></ul><br />Key points of stoma complications<br /><ul><li>Colostomy: prone to prolapse and hernia</li><li>Ileostomy: risk of high output, electrolyte imbalance</li><li>Urostomy: skin irritation from alkaline urine</li><li>Management: stoma nurse support, appliance fitting, skin care; surgery if severe</li></ul>",
