            "<b>Insert a peripherally inserted central catheter</b> is the correct answer. Total parenteral nutrition (TPN) is a hyperosmolar solution containing high concentrations of glucose, amino acids, lipids, electrolytes, and trace elements. Due to its high osmolarity, it is highly irritant to the endothelium of small peripheral veins and is strongly phlebitic. Administering TPN peripherally carries a high risk of thrombophlebitis, which can lead to pain, venous thrombosis, and loss of peripheral access. More seriously, extravasation of the hypertonic fluid can cause significant tissue damage and necrosis. Therefore, TPN must be administered into a large central vein, such as the superior vena cava, where the high blood flow rapidly dilutes the solution, minimising endothelial damage. A peripherally inserted central catheter (PICC) is a common, safe, and effective way to gain central venous access for medium-term use (weeks to months). It can often be inserted at the bedside by a trained practitioner, making it the most appropriate next step for this patient who requires nutritional support for an unknown duration while awaiting the resolution of his ileus.<br /><br /><b>Administer TPN via a peripheral cannula</b> is incorrect. While the patient has good peripheral access, using it for TPN is contraindicated and unsafe. The hypertonicity of the TPN solution would rapidly cause chemical phlebitis, leading to inflammation, pain, and thrombosis of the vein. This would not only be painful for the patient but would also lead to the rapid failure of the cannula and the loss of that venous access site. The risk of extravasation injury, where the TPN leaks into the surrounding subcutaneous tissue, is also significant and can result in severe tissue necrosis requiring surgical debridement. Special, less concentrated formulations for peripheral administration (peripheral parenteral nutrition or PPN) exist but provide incomplete nutrition and are only suitable for very short-term use (a few days), which is not appropriate here given the established and prolonged ileus.<br /><br /><b>Insert a nasojejunal feeding tube</b> is incorrect. This is a method of enteral feeding, where nutrition is delivered directly into the small bowel. The patient is described as having a prolonged ileus, which is a state of gut paralysis affecting both the small and large bowel, particularly after major abdominal surgery. In this situation, the gut is unable to absorb nutrients or propel contents forward. Attempting enteral feeding would be futile and could worsen the patient's condition by causing abdominal distension, vomiting, and increasing the risk of aspiration. Parenteral (intravenous) nutrition is specifically indicated because the enteral route is non-functional.<br /><br /><b>Insert a tunnelled central venous catheter</b> is an incorrect choice for the immediate next step. While a tunnelled line (e.g., a Hickman or Groshong line) provides excellent central venous access, it is typically reserved for very long-term therapy, such as for patients requiring home TPN for months or years, or for long-term chemotherapy. The insertion is a more invasive procedure than a PICC line, usually performed in an operating theatre or interventional radiology suite, and carries a higher immediate procedural risk. For an inpatient with an anticipated need for TPN for a period of weeks, a PICC line is the more appropriate, less invasive, and standard choice.<br /><br /><b>Create a feeding jejunostomy</b> is incorrect. A feeding jejunostomy is a surgically created opening into the jejunum for the purpose of long-term enteral feeding. This is a significant surgical procedure and is completely inappropriate in this context. Firstly, the patient has an ileus, meaning the gut is not working, so enteral feeding is contraindicated. Secondly, performing another operation on a patient who is only one week post-laparotomy and has post-operative complications would carry a very high risk. This option is reserved for patients with a functional lower gut but an inaccessible upper GI tract (e.g., due to oesophageal cancer) who require long-term nutritional support.",

A decade ago it was a commonly held belief that little harm would occur as a result of excessive administration of normal saline and many oliguric postoperative patients received enormous quantities of IV fluids. As a result, they developed hyperchloraemic acidosis. With a greater understanding of this potential complication, the use of electrolyte balanced solutions (Ringers lactate/ Hartmans) is now favoured over normal saline. In addition to this, solutions of 5% dextrose and dextrose/saline combinations are now generally not recommended for surgical patients. The other guidance includes:<br /><ul><li>Fluids given should be documented clearly and easily available</li><li>Assess the patient's fluid status when they leave theatre</li><li>If a patient is haemodynamically stable and euvolaemic, aim to restart oral fluid intake as soon as possible</li><li>Review patients whose urinary sodium is  < 20</li><li>If a patient is oedematous, hypovolaemia if present should be treated first.  This should then be followed by a negative balance of sodium and water, monitored using urine Na excretion levels.</li><li>Solutions such as Dextran 70 should be used in caution in patients with sepsis as there is a risk of developing acute renal injury.</li></ul><br /><b>References</b><br />British Consensus Guidelines on Intravenous Fluid Therapy for Adult Surgical Patients <br />GIFTASUP (2009)",

However, higher socioeconomic groups show a higher incidence of infectious mononucleosis, as acquiring EBV in adolescence or early adulthood results in symptomatic disease.",
