        "body": "The GMC has produced extensive guidance on how to appropriately perform intimate examinations and the role of chaperones in this. The guidance covers what constitutes an intimate examination, how a doctor should conduct such an examination and how chaperones should be involved in the process.<br /><br />Intimate examinations:<br /><ul><li>Essentially this is anything the patient would consider intimate or intrusive</li><li>This will most commonly be examinations of the rectum, genitalia and breasts</li><li>This definition can be different for any patient and you should think about whether the patient would consider what you are doing intimate</li></ul><br />Performing the examination:<br /><ul><li>As with any procedure, you should seek informed consent from the patient to carry out the examination</li><li>This involves explaining what you will do and why and how exposed they will be</li><li>You should make sure they are happy to proceed and ensure they have had all their questions answered</li><li>In addition you should explain that you will stop the examination at any point if asked to by the patient</li><li>During the examination it is good practice to only talk if it is relevant to the examination</li></ul><br />Chaperones:<br /><ul><li>A chaperone is an impartial person who is present during the examination to both offer support to the patient and act as an observer to ensure the examination is carried out in a professional manner</li><li>They should be a healthcare worker who has no relation to the patient or doctor. Patients may also wish to have family members present for support but they cannot be relied upon as chaperones as they are not impartial</li><li>The <span class=\"concept\" data-cid=\"10372\">full name and role of the chaperone should be documented in the medical records</span> with the examination findings</li><li>In the event of the patient making any allegations against the doctor with regards to the examination, the chaperone can be called on as a witness</li><li>The chaperone should also be able to safely announce whether they feel any behaviours are inappropriate during the examination</li><li>It is <span class=\"concept\" data-cid=\"10370\">not mandatory to have a chaperone and many patients may wish to be examined without another individual present. In these cases, the offer and refusal should be documented in the medical records</span></li><li>A doctor <span class=\"concept\" data-cid=\"10371\">should not feel pressured to perform an examination without a chaperone if they do not wish. However, they should ensure the patient is referred to a colleague who is comfortable doing so and that they would not wait unnecessarily</span> for treatment because of this</li></ul><br /><h5 class='notes-heading'>Examples</h5><br /><i>You are a male GP and are seeing a female Muslim patient who wears a Hijab due to a chronic cough. You need to perform a respiratory examination</i><br /><ul><li>Although you may not normally consider listening to the chest to be an intimate examination, you must be sensitive to other people's cultures and beliefs and in this case it is reasonable to assume the patient may wish for a chaperone to be present if she is to have her chest exposed for the examination</li><li>A chaperone should be offered and then if requested their full name and role documented in the medical records</li></ul><br /><i>A 63-year-old man attends his GP due to problems passing urine. His GP wishes to perform a prostate examination. The patient agrees but does not want a chaperone present</i><br /><ul><li>The offer and refusal of a chaperone should be documented in the medical records but this should not prevent the doctor performing the examination</li><li>If the doctor is comfortable to do so then they may perform the examination, if not they must refer to a colleague to do so</li></ul><br /><i>A 19-year-old female attends her GP with urethral discharge. The male GP wishes to perform a vaginal exam and take swabs but he feels she has been very inappropriately sexual with him during the consultation and she is refusing to allow a chaperone to be present for the examination</i><br /><ul><li>You should feel under no obligations to perform any procedure or examination you are not comfortable doing</li><li>The most reasonable solution here would be to ask if a colleague could perform the examination on your behalf provided they are happy to do so without a chaperone</li><li>A patient should never be forced to have a chaperone present for an examination if they do not wish although it is not unreasonable to further explain the reasons for offering a chaperone in these situations beyond simply offering one</li><li>A patient's care should not be delayed so ideally a colleague should be able to perform this examination within the immediate future or the patient should be referred on to another service which may be able to examine her</li></ul>",

Affected males can only have unaffected sons and carrier daughters.<br /><br />Each male child of a heterozygous female carrier has a 50% chance of being affected whilst each female child of a heterozygous female carrier has a 50% chance of being a carrier.<br /><br />The possibility of an affected father having children with a heterozygous female carrier is generally speaking extremely rare.

            "The correct answer is <b>Autosomal dominant</b>. The likely diagnosis in this patient is Marfan syndrome, which is an autosomal dominant disorder caused by a mutation in the FBN1 gene encoding fibrillin-1, a glycoprotein that is an essential component of the extracellular matrix. This condition affects connective tissue and has variable clinical manifestations including cardiovascular, ocular, and skeletal abnormalities. It is important to note that about 25% of Marfan cases result from de novo mutations.<br /><br /><b>X-linked recessive</b> inheritance is incorrect because Marfan syndrome does not follow this pattern. X-linked recessive disorders are typically more severe in males, as they have only one X chromosome and thus express the full phenotype if they inherit the mutated gene. Examples of X-linked recessive disorders include Duchenne muscular dystrophy and haemophilia A.<br /><br /><b>Mitochondrial</b> inheritance is also incorrect for Marfan syndrome. Mitochondrial inheritance refers to the transmission of genetic information through mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) exclusively from the mother to all her offspring, both male and female. Mitochondrial disorders often affect organs with high energy demands like muscles or nerves. Examples include Leber's hereditary optic neuropathy and mitochondrial encephalomyopathy.<br /><br /><b>Autosomal codominant</b> inheritance does not exist as a mode of inheritance; it seems to be a mix-up between autosomal dominant and codominant expression. Codominance refers to two different alleles being expressed equally in heterozygous individuals, such as blood group AB phenotype in the ABO blood group system.<br /><br />Finally, <b>Autosomal recessive</b> inheritance is also incorrect for Marfan syndrome. Autosomal recessive disorders require both parents to be carriers of a mutated gene for their offspring to be affected by the condition. If both parents are carriers, there is a 25% chance of having an affected child, a 50% chance of having a carrier child, and a 25% chance of having an unaffected, non-carrier child. Examples of autosomal recessive disorders include cystic fibrosis and sickle cell anaemia.",
