Given the history of ischaemic heart disease and the presence of a monomorphic wave pattern, the underlying rhythm is most likely in keeping with ventricular tachycardia. In the management of a tachyarrhythmia, it is important to establish the presence of any adverse features including ischaemia, syncope, shock or heart failure. In the absence of these, pharmacological cardioversion with amiodarone can be commenced. <br /><br /><b>Adenosine</b> is incorrect.

This patient does not have any adverse features (ischaemia, syncope, shock or heart failure) and, therefore, does not require DC cardioversion.<br /><br /><b>Magnesium sulphate</b> is incorrect.

            "<b>Arrange transvaginal ultrasound scan</b> is the correct answer. According to NICE guidelines on ectopic pregnancy and miscarriage (2019), women presenting with bleeding at greater than 6 weeks gestation should be referred to an early pregnancy assessment service for investigation. A transvaginal ultrasound scan is the most important investigation in this scenario as it can identify the location of the pregnancy (intrauterine versus ectopic), determine viability by detecting a fetal pole and heartbeat, and assess for signs of miscarriage. At 7 weeks gestation, a transvaginal scan should be able to visualise an intrauterine gestational sac with a yolk sac and possibly a fetal pole with cardiac activity. This investigation is crucial for distinguishing between viable pregnancy, miscarriage, and ectopic pregnancy, which guides subsequent management. Even in the absence of pain, ectopic pregnancy remains in the differential diagnosis and must be excluded, making imaging essential rather than expectant management.<br /><br /><b>Measure serum beta-hCG level</b> may provide supportive information but is not the most appropriate next step. Whilst beta-hCG levels can help assess pregnancy viability when correlated with ultrasound findings or when serial measurements show appropriate rise or fall, they do not provide definitive information about pregnancy location or viability. A single beta-hCG measurement has limited diagnostic value in isolation. The priority in a woman at 7 weeks gestation with bleeding is to visualise the pregnancy directly with ultrasound to exclude ectopic pregnancy and assess viability, rather than relying on biochemical markers which may delay definitive diagnosis.<br /><br /><b>Repeat urine pregnancy test in 7-10 days</b> would be inappropriate at this gestation. This expectant approach is only suitable for women who are less than 6 weeks pregnant with bleeding but no pain or risk factors for ectopic pregnancy. This patient is 7 weeks gestation, which mandates referral for assessment and ultrasound scanning according to NICE guidelines. Delaying investigation could miss an ectopic pregnancy or other significant pathology requiring intervention.<br /><br /><b>Arrange transabdominal ultrasound scan</b> is less appropriate than transvaginal scanning in early pregnancy. Transabdominal ultrasound has lower sensitivity and resolution in the first trimester compared to the transvaginal approach. At 7 weeks gestation, structures may not be adequately visualised transabdominally, particularly in women with higher body mass index or retroverted uterus. Transvaginal ultrasound is the gold standard investigation for early pregnancy complications as it provides superior visualisation of early gestational structures.<br /><br /><b>Measure serum progesterone level</b> has limited clinical utility in this scenario. Whilst low progesterone levels may be associated with non-viable pregnancies, there is significant overlap between viable and non-viable pregnancies, making it an unreliable diagnostic tool. Progesterone measurement does not help localise the pregnancy or distinguish between intrauterine and ectopic pregnancy. Current NICE guidelines do not recommend routine progesterone measurement in the assessment of early pregnancy bleeding, as direct visualisation with ultrasound provides more definitive diagnostic information.",
