            "The correct answer is <b>Achalasia</b>. Ankylosing spondylitis (AS) is a chronic inflammatory disease primarily affecting the axial skeleton, particularly the sacroiliac joints and spine. It can also present with extra-articular manifestations, but Achalasia is not typically associated with AS. Achalasia is a disorder of the oesophagus where it loses its ability to move food along, resulting in difficulty swallowing, regurgitation, and sometimes chest pain. The cause of achalasia is unknown and it's generally not linked with inflammatory conditions like AS.<br /><br /><b>Apical fibrosis</b> can be seen in patients with long-standing ankylosing spondylitis. This condition causes fibrotic changes at the apices of the lungs due to chronic inflammation. Although this manifestation is rare, it has been documented in the literature.<br /><br /><b>Achilles tendonitis</b> is another common manifestation in ankylosing spondylitis. Enthesitis or inflammation of sites where tendons or ligaments insert into bone can occur in up to 50% of patients with AS. The Achilles tendon is one of the most commonly affected sites.<br /><br /><b>Amyloidosis</b>, specifically secondary amyloidosis (AA), can occur as a complication of chronic inflammatory diseases including ankylosing spondylitis if there's persistent high disease activity over many years without appropriate treatment control.<br /><br />Finally, <b>Heart block</b> can also be associated with ankylosing spondylitis. Cardiovascular complications are well recognized in AS and include aortitis, aortic regurgitation, and conduction disturbances such as heart block which may require pacemaker insertion if severe.",

            "This patient presents with a combination of parkinsonian features (symmetrical bradykinesia and rigidity) and prominent, early autonomic dysfunction (postural hypotension suggested by dizziness on standing, urinary incontinence, and erectile dysfunction). This constellation of symptoms is highly characteristic of <b>Multiple system atrophy</b> (MSA). MSA is an atypical parkinsonian syndrome where autonomic failure is a core and often early feature. The autonomic symptoms, particularly erectile dysfunction, can predate the motor symptoms by several years, as described in this scenario. The parkinsonism in MSA is also more likely to be symmetrical at onset compared to the typically asymmetrical onset of idiopathic Parkinson's disease. The poor response of motor symptoms to levodopa therapy is another feature that supports a diagnosis of MSA over Parkinson's disease, although this is not mentioned in the stem. MSA is sub-classified into MSA-P (predominantly parkinsonian features) and MSA-C (predominantly cerebellar features). This patient's presentation is most consistent with MSA-P.<br /><br />While <b>Parkinson's disease</b> is the most common cause of parkinsonism, the clinical picture presented is less typical. Autonomic dysfunction does occur in Parkinson's disease, but it is characteristically a feature of the later stages of the illness. The presence of severe and early autonomic failure, especially with erectile dysfunction preceding the motor symptoms, strongly points away from idiopathic Parkinson's disease and towards an atypical parkinsonian syndrome like MSA. Additionally, the motor symptoms in Parkinson's disease usually begin asymmetrically.<br /><br /><b>Lewy body dementia</b> is a diagnosis that requires the presence of dementia in addition to other core features like parkinsonism, fluctuating cognition, and recurrent visual hallucinations.

        "question": "A 64-year-old man reports 18 months of progressive slowing of movement and stiffness. He also describes significant dizziness on standing and urinary incontinence. His wife mentions he has had erectile dysfunction for two years. Examination reveals symmetrical bradykinesia and rigidity.<br /><br />Select the single most likely diagnosis from the options below.",
        "correct_answer": "3",
        "question_notes": "This patient presents with a combination of parkinsonian features (symmetrical bradykinesia and rigidity) and prominent, early autonomic dysfunction (postural hypotension suggested by dizziness on standing, urinary incontinence, and erectile dysfunction). This constellation of symptoms is highly characteristic of <b>Multiple system atrophy</b> (MSA). MSA is an atypical parkinsonian syndrome where autonomic failure is a core and often early feature. The autonomic symptoms, particularly erectile dysfunction, can predate the motor symptoms by several years, as described in this scenario. The parkinsonism in MSA is also more likely to be symmetrical at onset compared to the typically asymmetrical onset of idiopathic Parkinson's disease. The poor response of motor symptoms to levodopa therapy is another feature that supports a diagnosis of MSA over Parkinson's disease, although this is not mentioned in the stem. MSA is sub-classified into MSA-P (predominantly parkinsonian features) and MSA-C (predominantly cerebellar features). This patient's presentation is most consistent with MSA-P.<br /><br />While <b>Parkinson's disease</b> is the most common cause of parkinsonism, the clinical picture presented is less typical. Autonomic dysfunction does occur in Parkinson's disease, but it is characteristically a feature of the later stages of the illness. The presence of severe and early autonomic failure, especially with erectile dysfunction preceding the motor symptoms, strongly points away from idiopathic Parkinson's disease and towards an atypical parkinsonian syndrome like MSA. Additionally, the motor symptoms in Parkinson's disease usually begin asymmetrically.<br /><br /><b>Lewy body dementia</b> is a diagnosis that requires the presence of dementia in addition to other core features like parkinsonism, fluctuating cognition, and recurrent visual hallucinations. This patient's history does not include any mention of cognitive impairment or hallucinations, which are essential for this diagnosis. Although autonomic dysfunction can be present, the absence of the core cognitive features makes this diagnosis unlikely.<br /><br /><b>Progressive supranuclear palsy</b> (PSP) is another atypical parkinsonian syndrome, but its clinical hallmarks are different.

Supportive care is the mainstay of treatment for this condition, although specialist treatment may be required if the patient is immunocompromised. This condition normally clears up on its own within 18 months. Time off school is not necessary but, as the condition is infectious, it is advised to avoid sharing baths, towels, or clothing with others to prevent transmission. <br /><br />Cryotherapy is not an appropriate management for molluscum contagiosum. There are multiple lesions. It may be used for cutaneous warts or veruccae. <br /><br />Use of a weak topical steroid is not indicated for the treatment of molluscum contagiosum. In immunocompromised individuals with molluscum contagiosum other topical treatments such as imiquimod or potassium hydroxide may be used. <br /><br />Permethrin is prescribed to treat scabies rather than molluscum contagiosum. Scabies would present with different skin lesions to molluscum contagiosum. Lesions often appear between the fingers, with visible burrowing and silver lines that progress to red raised spots.  <br /><br />As aforementioned, children with molluscum contagiosum can attend school.

        "question_notes": "This child has molluscum contagiosum. This skin condition is caused by a pox virus and can be identified by its raised, pearly white, and umbilicated lesions. Supportive care is the mainstay of treatment for this condition, although specialist treatment may be required if the patient is immunocompromised. This condition normally clears up on its own within 18 months. Time off school is not necessary but, as the condition is infectious, it is advised to avoid sharing baths, towels, or clothing with others to prevent transmission. <br /><br />Cryotherapy is not an appropriate management for molluscum contagiosum. There are multiple lesions. It may be used for cutaneous warts or veruccae. <br /><br />Use of a weak topical steroid is not indicated for the treatment of molluscum contagiosum. In immunocompromised individuals with molluscum contagiosum other topical treatments such as imiquimod or potassium hydroxide may be used. <br /><br />Permethrin is prescribed to treat scabies rather than molluscum contagiosum. Scabies would present with different skin lesions to molluscum contagiosum. Lesions often appear between the fingers, with visible burrowing and silver lines that progress to red raised spots.  <br /><br />As aforementioned, children with molluscum contagiosum can attend school. To prevent transmission they are instead advised to cover lesions with clothing or bandage where possible, avoid picking the lesions, and not to share towels with other individuals.",

        "body": "Molluscum contagiosum is a common skin infection caused by molluscum contagiosum virus (MCV), a member of the <span class=\"concept\" data-cid=\"11963\">Poxviridae family</span>. Transmission occurs directly by close personal contact, or indirectly via fomites (contaminated surfaces) such as shared towels and flannels. The majority of cases occur in children (often in children with atopic eczema), with the maximum incidence in preschool children aged 1-4 years.<br /><br />Typically, molluscum contagiosum presents with characteristic pinkish or pearly white papules with a central umbilication, which are up to 5 mm in diameter. Lesions appear in clusters in areas anywhere on the body (except the palms of the hands and the soles of the feet). In children, lesions are commonly seen on the trunk and in flexures, but anogenital lesions may also occur. In adults, sexual contact may lead to lesions developing on the genitalia, pubis, thighs, and lower abdomen. Rarely, lesions can occur on the oral mucosa and on the eyelids.<br /><br /><div class=\"container\"><div class=\"row\"><div class=\"col-md-3\"><a href=\"https://d32xxyeh8kfs8k.cloudfront.net/images_Passmedicine/dsd121b.jpg\" data-fancybox=\"gallery\" data-caption=\"Molluscum contagiosum .
