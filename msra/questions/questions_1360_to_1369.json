            "The correct answer in this scenario is to <b>give an accelerated course of the hepatitis B vaccine + hepatitis B immune globulin</b>. This is because the phlebotomist has not yet completed her hepatitis B vaccination course and has been exposed to a known hepatitis B positive patient. According to UK guidelines, following a needlestick injury from a hepatitis B positive source, both the accelerated course of the hepatitis B vaccine and administration of hepatitis B immune globulin are recommended for individuals who have not completed their vaccination series. The accelerated course of the vaccine helps boost the individual's immune response, while the immune globulin provides immediate passive immunity against the virus.<br /><br />The first option, <b>no action needed, complete hepatitis B vaccination course as normal</b>, is incorrect because it does not provide any immediate protection against contracting hepatitis B from the needlestick injury. While completing the vaccination series is important, it would not be sufficient in this case due to the high-risk exposure.<br /><br />The second option, <b>give oral ribavirin for 4 weeks</b>, is also incorrect. Ribavirin is an antiviral medication used primarily for treating infections such as chronic hepatitis C and respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) infection; it is not indicated for post-exposure prophylaxis or treatment of acute hepatitis B infection.<br /><br />The fourth option, <b>give hepatitis B immune globulin + oral ribavirin for 4 weeks</b>, combines elements from two other options but remains incorrect. As mentioned earlier, ribavirin is not effective in preventing or treating acute hepatitis B infection. Therefore, administering ribavirin alongside hepatitis B immune globulin would be unnecessary and potentially harmful due to potential side effects.<br /><br />Finally, the last option, <b>give hepatitis B immune globulin</b>, might seem like an appropriate choice at first glance. However, it only provides passive immunity and does not actively stimulate the individual's immune system to produce a long-lasting response. In this situation, the best course of action is to combine hepatitis B immune globulin with an accelerated course of the hepatitis B vaccine for both immediate protection and a more robust, long-term immune response.",

            "This patient has a small bowel obstruction. Symptoms of small bowel obstruction are similar to those of large bowel obstruction with abdominal pain, distention and constipation. One differentiating feature between small and large bowel obstruction is the onset of nausea and vomiting. Nausea and vomiting are early signs of small bowel obstruction as this suggests a proximal lesion. Adhesions are the most common cause of small bowel obstruction, particularly if there is a previous history of abdominal surgery. Adhesions are scar tissue usually from inflammation or manipulation of the abdominal contents during surgery. They may be present in patients who are asymptomatic for years before the initial onset of symptoms. This patient has a history of a previous cesarean section, making adhesional small bowel obstruction a likely diagnosis.<br /><br />Colorectal cancer is the most common cause of large bowel obstruction.

            "<b>Fluoxetine</b> is the correct answer. In children and adolescents with moderate to severe depression, fluoxetine is the only SSRI recommended as first-line pharmacological treatment according to NICE guidelines. This is based on evidence from clinical trials showing a more favourable risk-benefit profile compared to other antidepressants in this age group. The decision to use medication in adolescents with depression should always be made alongside psychological therapies, as is planned in this case. Fluoxetine should be initiated at a lower dose in adolescents (typically 10mg daily) and the patient should be reviewed within one week of starting treatment, as young people under 25 years are at higher risk of suicidal ideation when beginning antidepressant therapy. Despite the absence of current suicidal thoughts, close monitoring is essential.<br /><br /><b>Citalopram</b> is not recommended as first-line treatment for depression in children and adolescents. While it is commonly used in adults with depression, there is insufficient evidence supporting its efficacy and safety in the paediatric population. Additionally, citalopram carries a dose-dependent risk of QT interval prolongation, which requires particular caution. NICE guidelines specifically recommend against using citalopram in children and adolescents with depression.<br /><br /><b>Mirtazapine</b>, a noradrenergic and specific serotonergic antidepressant (NaSSA), is not licensed for use in children and adolescents under 18 years. While it may be beneficial in adults with depression associated with significant sleep disturbance or appetite loss (which this patient demonstrates), there is insufficient evidence for its safety and efficacy in the adolescent population. It is therefore not appropriate as first-line treatment in this case.<br /><br /><b>Sertraline</b>, although an SSRI like fluoxetine, is not recommended as first-line pharmacological treatment for depression in children and adolescents. While it may be used in adults and has good evidence for use in post-myocardial infarction depression, clinical trials have not demonstrated a favourable risk-benefit profile in the paediatric population. NICE guidelines specifically recommend fluoxetine over sertraline in this age group.<br /><br /><b>Venlafaxine</b>, a serotonin-norepinephrine reuptake inhibitor (SNRI), is contraindicated in children and adolescents under 18 years for the treatment of depression. It carries a higher risk of discontinuation symptoms and cardiovascular side effects compared to SSRIs. Additionally, there are concerns about an increased risk of suicidal thinking and self-harm with venlafaxine in the adolescent population, making it an inappropriate choice for this patient.",

            "The correct answer is <b>Catatonia</b>. Catatonia is not a first-rank symptom of schizophrenia according to the diagnostic criteria outlined by Schneider. It is, however, a significant clinical feature that can be associated with several psychiatric disorders including schizophrenia, mood disorders and other psychotic disorders. Catatonia can present with various symptoms such as stupor, mutism, negativism, posturing, mannerism, stereotypy, agitation, grimacing and echolalia among others.<br /><br /><b>Delusional perceptions</b> are considered a first-rank symptom of schizophrenia. This involves a situation where a true perception is given some special and usually bizarre significance by the patient.

It is, however, a significant clinical feature that can be associated with several psychiatric disorders including schizophrenia, mood disorders and other psychotic disorders. Catatonia can present with various symptoms such as stupor, mutism, negativism, posturing, mannerism, stereotypy, agitation, grimacing and echolalia among others.<br /><br /><b>Delusional perceptions</b> are considered a first-rank symptom of schizophrenia. This involves a situation where a true perception is given some special and usually bizarre significance by the patient.

            "<b>Osteomalacia</b> is the correct diagnosis in this case. The patient presents with classic features of osteomalacia including bone pain, muscle weakness, and a biochemical profile showing low calcium, low phosphate, raised alkaline phosphatase (ALP), and raised parathyroid hormone (PTH). The underlying cause is likely vitamin D deficiency secondary to malabsorption from Crohn's disease and multiple small bowel resections. Small bowel disease affects the absorption of vitamin D and calcium, leading to vitamin D deficiency (confirmed by the low level of 20 nmol/L). The body responds by increasing PTH secretion (secondary hyperparathyroidism) in an attempt to maintain calcium homeostasis. This elevated PTH increases bone turnover, resulting in raised ALP. The combination of low calcium, low phosphate, high ALP, high PTH, and low vitamin D is pathognomonic for osteomalacia.<br /><br /><b>Osteoporosis</b> is incorrect. While osteoporosis can occur in patients with Crohn's disease, it typically presents with normal calcium, phosphate, ALP, and PTH levels. Osteoporosis represents reduced bone density without defective mineralisation, whereas osteomalacia involves defective mineralisation of the bone matrix. The biochemical abnormalities in this case, particularly the low calcium and phosphate with raised ALP and PTH, are inconsistent with osteoporosis.<br /><br /><b>Primary hyperparathyroidism</b> is incorrect. Although primary hyperparathyroidism does present with raised PTH and ALP, it typically causes hypercalcaemia rather than hypocalcaemia. The phosphate would be low, but the calcium would be elevated due to the autonomous secretion of PTH. This patient's low calcium level makes primary hyperparathyroidism unlikely.<br /><br /><b>Paget's disease</b> is incorrect. Paget's disease is characterised by excessive and disorganised bone remodelling. While it does present with elevated ALP, the calcium, phosphate, and PTH levels are typically normal. The patient's low calcium and phosphate with elevated PTH are inconsistent with Paget's disease. Additionally, Paget's disease typically affects older patients and often involves localised rather than generalised bone pain.<br /><br /><b>Renal osteodystrophy</b> is incorrect. Renal osteodystrophy occurs in chronic kidney disease and is characterised by low calcium, high phosphate, high ALP, and high PTH. The key difference here is the phosphate level, which would be elevated in renal osteodystrophy due to decreased renal excretion, whereas this patient has low phosphate. There is also no mention of renal impairment in the patient's history.",

            "The correct answer is right hemicolectomy. The patient presents with the symptoms of large bowel obstruction due to hepatic flexure cancer. Cancers of the cecum, ascending or a proximal third of the transverse colon are resected using a right hemicolectomy. The procedure involves removing the cecum, the ascending colon and the proximal third of the transverse colon. However, an extended right hemicolectomy may be executed for lesions on the hepatic flexure, including the whole middle colic territory. <br /><br />Hartmann's procedure is executed in emergencies, such as bowel obstruction or perforation. This involves complete resection of the rectum and sigmoid colon with the formation of an end colostomy and the closure of the rectal stump. This can be revised later, with anastomosis of the two stumps. The mass here is at the hepatic flexure. Therefore the answer is a right hemicolectomy as removing the sigmoid would not help. <br /><br />A high anterior resection is used to excise upper rectal tumours. It involves the resection of the proximal rectum and sigmoid colon, with the advantage of leaving the anal sphincter intact. This allows the creation of anastomoses between the descending colon and the lower rectum. Often a loop ileostomy is performed to defunction the colon to allow healing of the anastomoses. This will be reversed later when the anastomoses have healed. The patient has a mass in the hepatic flexure, not in the rectum, making this an incorrect answer. <br /><br />A left hemicolectomy is used to excise tumours of the distal two-thirds of the transverse colon and descending colon. It involves removing the distal transverse colon, the descending colon and the sigmoid colon. The rectum is left intact and anastomosed with the proximal transverse colon, so the patient will not have a permanent stoma. The patient's mass is at the hepatic flexure (right transverse colon) making the choice of this procedure inappropriate. <br /><br />A low anterior resection is used to approach low rectal tumours (less than 5cm from the anus). It involves excision of the distal colon, rectum and anal sphincters, resulting in a permanent end colostomy. The patient has a mass in the hepatic flexure, not in the rectum, making this an incorrect answer.",
