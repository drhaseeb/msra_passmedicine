            "The correct answer is <b>Inhibition of ovulation</b>. Nexplanon, also known as the etonogestrel contraceptive implant, primarily works by inhibiting ovulation. The progestogen component in Nexplanon suppresses the mid-cycle surge in luteinising hormone (LH), preventing the release of an egg from the ovaries. This is its primary method of contraception.<br /><br />Discussing the other options:<br /><br /><b>Thickens cervical mucus</b>: While it's true that progestogen can lead to thickening of cervical mucus, this is not the primary mechanism of action for Nexplanon. This effect can contribute to contraceptive efficacy by creating a barrier that makes it more difficult for sperm to reach an egg, but its role is secondary compared to inhibition of ovulation.<br /><br /><b>Thins endometrial lining</b>: Progestogens including etonogestrel can cause thinning of the endometrial lining. However, this is not how Nexplanon primarily prevents pregnancy. Thinning the endometrial lining may theoretically make it less likely for a fertilised egg to implant and develop into a pregnancy, but again this effect is secondary to prevention of ovulation.<br /><br /><b>Causes fallopian tube dysfunction</b>: This option is incorrect. Nexplanon does not cause fallopian tube dysfunction or alter tubal motility. Contraceptive methods such as intrauterine devices (IUDs) may interfere with sperm transport within the uterus and fallopian tubes, but this isn't applicable to hormonal implants like Nexplanon.<br /><br /><b>Prevents implantation</b>: Finally, while thinning of the endometrium might theoretically impede implantation if fertilisation were to occur despite inhibition of ovulation and changes in cervical mucus, prevention of implantation isn't considered a main mechanism by which Nexplanon or other hormonal contraceptives work. It's worth noting that there's ongoing debate and research regarding how much hormonal contraceptives might prevent implantation versus simply preventing fertilisation in the first place.<br />",

        "body": "Personality disorders (PD) are a group of mental health conditions characterised by persistent patterns of thinking, feeling, and behaving that are significantly different from cultural expectations. These patterns can lead to distress or problems in personal, social, and occupational functioning. It is thought that around 1 in 20 people have a personality disorder.<br /><br />For many years patients were diagnosed with a specific 'named' personality disorder, such as narcissistic or paranoid. This approach was changed significantly with the introduction of the ICD-11 classification which marked a shift towards a more dimensional model, such as severity and specific problems. This allows for a more flexible and comprehensive understanding of personality pathology.<br /><br />The majority of patients you'll encounter with personality disorders will be 'labelled' using the previous classification system. We've therefore included details of this classification at the end of the notes.<br /><br /><h5 class='notes-heading'>ICD-11 classification of personality disorders</h5><br /><b>Key Features of Personality Disorder (ICD-11)</b><br /><ul><li>Persistent Pattern: The individual's patterns of cognition, emotional experience, behaviour, and interpersonal functioning deviate from cultural expectations. These patterns are stable over time and span across various personal and social situations.</li><li>Impairment: The deviation results in significant problems or dysfunctions in the person\u2019s life, especially in relationships, work, or social functioning.</li><li>Duration: These characteristics are stable over time, beginning in adolescence or early adulthood, and are not transient.</li><li>Distress or Dysfunction: The impairment may result in distress to the individual or others. These patterns are not explained by another mental disorder, a medical condition, or substance misuse.</li></ul><br /><b>Severity Classification in ICD-11</b><br /><br />In the ICD-11, personality disorders are classified based on the degree of severity. This provides a broader and more flexible approach:<br /><br />Mild Personality Disorder:<br /><ul><li>Some impairments in functioning, often limited to specific areas of life (e.g., intimate relationships or work).</li><li>Symptoms may be noticeable to others but do not cause pervasive distress or dysfunction.</li><li>The individual may still maintain relatively stable relationships and occupational roles.</li></ul><br />Moderate Personality Disorder:<br /><ul><li>More significant impairments in multiple areas of life (personal, social, and work).</li><li>The individual may struggle with maintaining close relationships, and there may be greater interpersonal difficulties.</li><li>More distressing symptoms are present, but the individual can manage day-to-day functioning with some effort or support.</li></ul><br />Severe Personality Disorder:<br /><ul><li>Profound impairments in all areas of life.</li><li>Individuals may experience pervasive difficulties in interpersonal relationships, self-identity, and coping mechanisms.</li><li>Significant distress, dysfunction, and reduced quality of life are common.</li><li>Individuals may require intensive and long-term therapeutic interventions.</li></ul><br /><b>Personality Disorder Trait Domains:</b><br /><br />In addition to severity, ICD-11 allows clinicians to specify trait domains that represent the predominant problematic areas in the individual's personality. These are:<br /><ul><li>Negative Affectivity:<ul><li>Tendency to experience a wide range of negative emotions such as anxiety, depression, guilt, and anger.</li><li>Individuals may be prone to mood swings, insecurity, and emotional lability.</li></ul></li><li>Detachment:<ul><li>Avoidance of social interactions, emotional withdrawal, and limited pleasure from relationships.</li><li>Individuals may appear cold, aloof, and isolated.</li></ul></li><li>Dissociality:<ul><li>Disregard for the rights and feelings of others, lack of empathy, and difficulty forming prosocial relationships.</li><li>mpulsivity and manipulative behaviours are common traits.</li></ul></li><li>Disinhibition:<ul><li>Impulsiveness, risk-taking, and difficulty controlling behaviours.</li><li>Individuals may struggle with planning and foresight, leading to reckless or irresponsible actions.</li></ul></li><li>Anankastia:<ul><li>Preoccupation with orderliness, control, and perfectionism.</li><li>Individuals may be rigid, stubborn, and excessively focused on rules and details.</li></ul></li><li>Borderline Pattern (also recognised in ICD-11):<ul><li>An additional qualifier for those showing emotional instability, intense and unstable interpersonal relationships, a fluctuating sense of identity, and impulsivity. </li><li>This pattern is akin to borderline personality disorder as recognised in ICD-10 and DSM-5.</li></ul></li></ul><br /><br /><h5 class='notes-heading'>Previous classification of personality disorders</h5><br />They are typically categorised as belonging to one of three clusters:<br /><br /><div class=\"table-responsive\"><table class = \"tlarge table table-striped table-bordered\"  data-role=\"table\" id=\"tableid1\" ><thead><tr><th>Cluster A: 'Odd or Eccentric'</th><th>Cluster B: 'Dramatic, Emotional, or Erratic'</th><th>Cluster C: 'Anxious and Fearful'</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td><ul><li>Paranoid</li><li>Schizoid</li><li>Schizotypal</td><td></li><li>Antisocial</li><li>Borderline (Emotionally Unstable)</li><li>Histrionic</li><li>Narcissistic</td><td></li><li>Obsessive-Compulsive</li><li>Avoidant </li><li>Dependent</td></tr></tbody></table></div></li></ul><br /><br /><b>Cluster A: 'Odd or Eccentric'</b><br /><br /><span class=\"concept\" data-cid=\"6492\">Paranoid</span><br /><ul><li>\t<span class=\"concept\" data-cid=\"5195\">Hypersensitivity and an unforgiving attitude when insulted</span></li><li>\tUnwarranted tendency to questions the loyalty of friends</li><li>\tReluctance to confide in others</li><li>\tPreoccupation with conspirational beliefs and hidden meaning</li><li>\tUnwarranted tendency to perceive attacks on their character</li></ul><br /><span class=\"concept\" data-cid=\"6493\">Schizoid</span><br /><ul><li>\tIndifference to praise and criticism</li><li>\t<span class=\"concept\" data-cid=\"4103\">Preference for solitary activities</span></li><li>\t<span class=\"concept\" data-cid=\"4103\">Lack of interest in sexual interactions</span></li><li>\tLack of desire for companionship</li><li>\tEmotional coldness</li><li>\tFew interests</li><li>\tFew friends or confidants other than family</li></ul><br /><span class=\"concept\" data-cid=\"6494\">Schizotypal</span><br /><ul><li>\tIdeas of reference (differ from delusions in that some insight is retained)</li><li>\t<span class=\"concept\" data-cid=\"1845\">Odd beliefs</span> and magical thinking</li><li>\tUnusual perceptual disturbances</li><li>\tParanoid ideation and suspiciousness</li><li>\tOdd, eccentric behaviour</li><li>\t<span class=\"concept\" data-cid=\"8949\">Lack of close friends</span> other than family members</li><li>\tInappropriate affect</li><li>\tOdd speech without being incoherent</li></ul><br /><br /><b>Cluster B: 'Dramatic, Emotional, or Erratic' </b><br /><br /><span class=\"concept\" data-cid=\"6485\">Antisocial</span><br /><ul><li><span class=\"concept\" data-cid=\"5189\">Failure to conform to social norms</span> with respect to lawful behaviours as indicated by repeatedly performing acts that are grounds for arrest;</li><li><span class=\"concept\" data-cid=\"1845\">More common in men</span>;</li><li>Deception, as indicated by repeatedly lying, use of aliases, or conning others for personal profit or pleasure;

            "<b>Intravenous piperacillin with tazobactam</b> is the correct answer for this patient with late-onset hospital-acquired pneumonia (HAP). This patient has developed pneumonia on day 6 of her hospital admission, which classifies it as late-onset HAP (occurring after 4 days). Late-onset HAP is associated with a higher risk of infection with gram-negative bacilli such as <i>Escherichia coli</i>, <i>Klebsiella pneumoniae</i>, <i>Enterobacter</i> species, and <i>Acinetobacter</i> species, as well as <i>Pseudomonas aeruginosa</i>. These organisms are often resistant to narrow-spectrum antibiotics. According to BNF guidance, patients with severe signs or symptoms (as evidenced by this patient's clinical presentation requiring hospital-level care) or those at higher risk of resistance (such as late-onset HAP) should receive broad-spectrum coverage. Intravenous piperacillin with tazobactam provides excellent coverage against gram-negative bacilli including <i>Pseudomonas</i>, as well as gram-positive organisms and anaerobes. The combination of a beta-lactam antibiotic with a beta-lactamase inhibitor helps overcome resistance mechanisms commonly found in hospital-acquired pathogens.<br /><br /><b>Intravenous co-amoxiclav</b> would be insufficient for late-onset HAP. Whilst co-amoxiclav provides reasonable broad-spectrum coverage for many community-acquired infections and early HAP, it has poor activity against <i>Pseudomonas aeruginosa</i> and may not adequately cover the gram-negative bacilli commonly implicated in late-onset hospital-acquired infections. This patient's infection occurring on day 6 places her at higher risk for these resistant organisms, making co-amoxiclav an inadequate choice despite its broad-spectrum properties.<br /><br /><b>Oral co-amoxiclav</b> is recommended by the BNF for non-severe HAP in patients not at higher risk of resistance. However, this patient has developed pneumonia after 4 days of hospitalisation, placing her in the late-onset category with higher risk of resistant organisms, particularly gram-negative bacilli. Additionally, the oral route may not be appropriate given the severity of her presentation with consolidation on chest radiograph, and intravenous therapy is generally preferred for hospital-acquired infections to ensure adequate tissue penetration and bioavailability.<br /><br /><b>Intravenous flucloxacillin</b> is a narrow-spectrum antibiotic with excellent activity against methicillin-sensitive <i>Staphylococcus aureus</i> (MSSA). Whilst <i>S. aureus</i> is indeed a common cause of HAP, flucloxacillin alone would not provide adequate coverage for the gram-negative bacilli that are particularly associated with late-onset HAP. This patient requires broader spectrum coverage given the timing of her infection. Flucloxacillin might be considered as part of combination therapy if MSSA was specifically identified, but would be inappropriate as monotherapy in this clinical context.<br /><br /><b>Oral clarithromycin</b> is a macrolide antibiotic commonly used in community-acquired pneumonia, often in combination with other agents. However, it has poor activity against gram-negative bacilli and would be wholly inadequate for late-onset HAP. Macrolides are not recommended as first-line therapy for hospital-acquired infections due to increasing resistance patterns and their spectrum of activity, which does not adequately cover the organisms typically responsible for HAP, particularly the gram-negative pathogens seen in late-onset disease.",

            "<b>2 week-wait referral</b> is the correct answer in this case. This patient presents with several red flag features that warrant urgent investigation for possible malignancy. The combination of unilateral nasal symptoms, epistaxis (nosebleeds), and what appears to be a unilateral nasal polyp in a 68-year-old man with significant smoking history and occupational exposure to construction materials creates a high index of suspicion for nasal or sinus malignancy. Unilateral nasal polyps are particularly concerning as true nasal polyps are typically bilateral. A unilateral nasal mass in an older patient, especially with bleeding, should be considered malignant until proven otherwise. The patient's age, smoking history, and occupational exposure to potential carcinogens further increase the risk. According to NICE guidelines, patients with unilateral nasal symptoms, particularly when associated with bleeding and in the presence of risk factors, should be referred urgently via the 2-week-wait pathway for suspected head and neck cancer. Early diagnosis is crucial for optimal outcomes in nasal and sinus malignancies.<br /><br /><b>Routine referral for nasal cautery</b> would be inappropriate as the primary management in this case. While cautery can be effective for managing recurrent epistaxis from anterior nasal bleeding points, this approach fails to address the underlying cause of the bleeding. The presence of what appears to be a unilateral nasal polyp with associated bleeding requires urgent investigation rather than symptomatic treatment. Cautery would only address the bleeding symptom without investigating the potentially serious underlying pathology. Furthermore, attempting cautery in the presence of a nasal mass could potentially cause harm or delay appropriate diagnosis. The unilateral nature of the symptoms and the presence of a mass lesion necessitate tissue diagnosis before any local treatments are considered.<br /><br /><b>Anti-histamine nasal drops</b> are not appropriate for this clinical scenario. Anti-histamines are primarily used for allergic rhinitis and would not be effective for the symptoms described. This patient's presentation with unilateral nasal obstruction, bleeding, and a visible nasal mass is not consistent with allergic rhinitis, which typically presents with bilateral symptoms, clear rhinorrhoea, sneezing, and itching. The presence of epistaxis and a unilateral mass strongly suggests a structural or potentially malignant cause rather than an allergic process. Using anti-histamine drops would provide no therapeutic benefit and would inappropriately delay the urgent investigation that this patient requires. The age of the patient and the unilateral nature of symptoms make allergic rhinitis an unlikely diagnosis.<br /><br /><b>Oral prednisolone</b> would be contraindicated in this clinical scenario. While corticosteroids can be effective in shrinking true nasal polyps and are often used in the management of chronic rhinosinusitis with polyposis, they should never be used when malignancy is suspected. The unilateral presentation with bleeding raises significant concern for malignancy, and corticosteroids could potentially mask symptoms or delay diagnosis of a serious underlying condition. Additionally, if this lesion is malignant, corticosteroids could theoretically promote tumour growth or interfere with subsequent treatment. The immunosuppressive effects of systemic corticosteroids could also complicate management if the patient requires surgical intervention. Any corticosteroid treatment should only be considered after malignancy has been excluded through appropriate investigation.<br /><br /><b>Topical corticosteroid nasal spray</b> would be inappropriate as the initial management in this case. While topical corticosteroids are indeed the first-line treatment for bilateral nasal polyps and can shrink polyp size in approximately 80% of patients with chronic rhinosinusitis with polyposis, they should not be used when malignancy is suspected. The unilateral nature of this patient's symptoms, combined with epistaxis and his risk factors (age, smoking history, occupational exposure), creates a high suspicion for malignancy that must be investigated urgently. Using topical corticosteroids could potentially delay diagnosis by temporarily reducing inflammation or masking symptoms. Even if this were a benign polyp, the unilateral presentation with bleeding warrants tissue diagnosis before any treatment is initiated. Topical corticosteroids would only be appropriate after malignancy has been excluded and a diagnosis of benign nasal polyposis has been confirmed.",

        "question": "A 68-year-old gentleman comes to see you reporting that he feels his left nostril is blocked and he has had frequent nose bleeds for the past 3 weeks. He has a past medical history of diabetes and high blood pressure both of which are well controlled with medications. He used to work in construction and has smoked 20 cigarettes per day since he was around 20.<br /><br />On examination, you note a left sided nasal polyp.<br /><br />Which one of the following would be the most appropriate next step?",
        "correct_answer": "1",
        "question_notes": "<b>2 week-wait referral</b> is the correct answer in this case. This patient presents with several red flag features that warrant urgent investigation for possible malignancy. The combination of unilateral nasal symptoms, epistaxis (nosebleeds), and what appears to be a unilateral nasal polyp in a 68-year-old man with significant smoking history and occupational exposure to construction materials creates a high index of suspicion for nasal or sinus malignancy. Unilateral nasal polyps are particularly concerning as true nasal polyps are typically bilateral. A unilateral nasal mass in an older patient, especially with bleeding, should be considered malignant until proven otherwise. The patient's age, smoking history, and occupational exposure to potential carcinogens further increase the risk. According to NICE guidelines, patients with unilateral nasal symptoms, particularly when associated with bleeding and in the presence of risk factors, should be referred urgently via the 2-week-wait pathway for suspected head and neck cancer. Early diagnosis is crucial for optimal outcomes in nasal and sinus malignancies.<br /><br /><b>Routine referral for nasal cautery</b> would be inappropriate as the primary management in this case. While cautery can be effective for managing recurrent epistaxis from anterior nasal bleeding points, this approach fails to address the underlying cause of the bleeding. The presence of what appears to be a unilateral nasal polyp with associated bleeding requires urgent investigation rather than symptomatic treatment. Cautery would only address the bleeding symptom without investigating the potentially serious underlying pathology. Furthermore, attempting cautery in the presence of a nasal mass could potentially cause harm or delay appropriate diagnosis.

            "<b>Refer urgently to an ophthalmologist</b> is the correct management for this patient presenting with acute anterior uveitis (iritis). The clinical presentation of acute onset painful red eye with photophobia and lacrimation in a patient with ankylosing spondylitis is highly suggestive of anterior uveitis. Ankylosing spondylitis is strongly associated with HLA-B27, which predisposes to anterior uveitis in approximately 25-30% of patients. The acute nature of symptoms developing over 3 hours, combined with the intense photophobia and the patient's underlying condition, makes this a sight-threatening emergency requiring immediate specialist assessment. Anterior uveitis can lead to serious complications including posterior synechiae, secondary glaucoma, cataract formation, and permanent visual impairment if not treated promptly and appropriately. The ophthalmologist will perform detailed examination including slit-lamp assessment to confirm the diagnosis, assess for complications such as hypopyon or raised intraocular pressure, and initiate appropriate treatment with topical corticosteroids and cycloplegics under specialist supervision. Early intervention is crucial to prevent irreversible damage to ocular structures.<br /><br /><b>Treat with topical corticosteroids</b> is inappropriate as initial management in primary care. While topical corticosteroids are indeed the mainstay of treatment for anterior uveitis, they should only be initiated by an ophthalmologist after confirming the diagnosis through slit-lamp examination. Starting steroids without specialist assessment is potentially dangerous because corticosteroids can worsen certain conditions that may mimic uveitis, particularly infectious causes of red eye such as bacterial, viral, or fungal keratitis. In these infectious conditions, steroids can lead to corneal perforation, worsening of infection, and severe complications. Additionally, the type, concentration, and frequency of steroid drops need to be carefully selected based on the severity of inflammation, and this requires specialist expertise. The ophthalmologist also needs to monitor for steroid-induced complications such as raised intraocular pressure and cataract formation during treatment. Therefore, while steroids will likely be part of the eventual treatment plan, they must be prescribed and monitored by a specialist.<br /><br /><b>Refer routinely to ophthalmology</b> is inadequate given the acute and potentially sight-threatening nature of this presentation. Routine referrals typically take weeks to months to be seen, which is far too long for a patient with acute anterior uveitis. The rapid onset of symptoms over just 3 hours, combined with the severe photophobia and pain, indicates active inflammation that requires immediate attention. Delaying treatment in anterior uveitis can lead to irreversible complications including posterior synechiae formation (where the iris adheres to the lens), secondary glaucoma due to inflammatory debris blocking drainage channels, cataract formation, and in severe cases, permanent visual loss. The inflammation can also spread to involve other parts of the eye if left untreated. Given that this patient has ankylosing spondylitis, he is at higher risk of developing recurrent episodes and more severe disease, making prompt treatment even more critical. The acute nature of anterior uveitis demands same-day ophthalmological assessment to prevent these serious complications.<br /><br /><b>Treat with chloramphenicol eye drops</b> is completely inappropriate for this clinical scenario. Chloramphenicol is an antibiotic used to treat bacterial conjunctivitis and some cases of bacterial keratitis, but this patient's presentation is not consistent with a bacterial infection. The combination of severe photophobia, pain that has worsened rapidly over 3 hours, and the patient's history of ankylosing spondylitis strongly suggests inflammatory rather than infectious pathology. Bacterial conjunctivitis typically presents with purulent discharge, grittiness rather than severe pain, and rarely causes significant photophobia. Using antibiotics inappropriately contributes to antimicrobial resistance and delays appropriate treatment. More importantly, treating this case as simple bacterial conjunctivitis would mean missing the diagnosis of anterior uveitis, allowing the inflammatory process to continue unchecked and potentially leading to the serious complications mentioned above. The patient requires urgent specialist assessment and anti-inflammatory treatment, not antibiotics.<br /><br /><b>Prescribe cycloplegic eye drops and review in 24 hours</b> appears more sophisticated as cycloplegics are indeed used in treating anterior uveitis, but this approach is still inappropriate for primary care management. While cycloplegic agents like atropine or cyclopentolate are valuable in treating anterior uveitis by dilating the pupil and preventing posterior synechiae formation, they should only be prescribed as part of specialist management. Cycloplegics can mask important clinical signs and potentially worsen certain conditions if used inappropriately. For instance, in angle-closure glaucoma, pupil dilation can precipitate an acute attack by further narrowing the drainage angle. Additionally, using cycloplegics alone without concurrent anti-inflammatory treatment (corticosteroids) is inadequate for managing the underlying inflammatory process in anterior uveitis. The 24-hour review timeframe, while shorter than routine referral, is still too long for this acute presentation. This approach also places inappropriate responsibility on the GP to manage a specialist condition that requires slit-lamp examination and expertise in ocular inflammation.",
