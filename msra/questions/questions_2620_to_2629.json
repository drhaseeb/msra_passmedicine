            "<b>Continuous positive airway pressure</b> is the correct answer in this scenario. This patient presents with acute heart failure causing pulmonary oedema, evidenced by acute breathlessness, bilateral basal crackles, and hypoxia. Despite initial treatment with oxygen, intravenous loop diuretics (furosemide), and vasodilators (GTN), she remains severely dyspnoeic with persistent hypoxia on maximal oxygen therapy. This represents respiratory failure secondary to acute heart failure not responding to initial medical management. CPAP is specifically indicated in this situation as it improves oxygenation by recruiting alveoli, reduces the work of breathing, and decreases both preload and afterload on the heart. Studies have shown that CPAP reduces the need for intubation and may improve mortality in acute cardiogenic pulmonary oedema. It should be considered early in patients who remain hypoxic despite maximal oxygen therapy and initial medical treatment, before they deteriorate further requiring invasive ventilation.<br /><br /><b>Intravenous morphine</b> was historically used routinely in acute heart failure to reduce dyspnoea and anxiety. However, NICE guidelines now recommend against routine use of opiates in acute heart failure. Some studies have suggested increased morbidity in patients given opiates, possibly due to respiratory depression, reduced respiratory drive, and delayed mobilisation. Whilst it may provide symptomatic relief, it does not address the underlying respiratory failure and would be inappropriate when a more effective intervention (CPAP) is available. In this patient with significant hypoxia, morphine could worsen respiratory depression.<br /><br /><b>Intravenous dobutamine</b> is an inotropic agent used in acute heart failure complicated by cardiogenic shock or severe hypotension (typically systolic BP < 85 mmHg) with evidence of hypoperfusion. This patient has no mention of hypotension or shock, and the primary problem is respiratory failure from pulmonary oedema rather than inadequate cardiac output with end-organ hypoperfusion. Dobutamine would not be the appropriate next step when the patient requires ventilatory support for respiratory failure. Inotropes are reserved for patients with severe left ventricular dysfunction and potentially reversible cardiogenic shock.<br /><br /><b>Intubation and mechanical ventilation</b> represents invasive ventilatory support and should be reserved for patients who fail to respond to non-invasive ventilation or who have absolute indications for intubation (such as reduced consciousness, inability to protect airway, or cardiovascular instability). This patient should be given a trial of CPAP first, as non-invasive ventilation has been shown to reduce the need for intubation in acute cardiogenic pulmonary oedema. Invasive ventilation carries significant risks including ventilator-associated pneumonia, sedation requirements, and prolonged ICU stay, so should be avoided if possible.<br /><br /><b>Intravenous aminophylline</b> is a bronchodilator sometimes used in severe acute asthma or exacerbations of COPD. It has no role in the management of acute heart failure and pulmonary oedema. This patient's presentation is consistent with cardiogenic pulmonary oedema rather than bronchospasm, with bilateral basal crackles rather than wheeze. Aminophylline has a narrow therapeutic window and significant side effects including arrhythmias, which could be particularly dangerous in a patient with acute heart failure. The appropriate management is to address the respiratory failure with CPAP.",

Hard exudates are seen in both hypertensive and diabetic retinopathy.<br /><br />2. Scattered dot/blot haemorrhages, most easily seen surrounding the area of hard exudate, and flame haemorrhage in the upper right quadrant of the image.

There are no signs of AV nipping (seen by focal narrowing of venules where they cross the arteries) or silver wiring (where arterioles appear white as a result of occlusion of the vessels), which are suggestive of hypertensive retinopathy.

This patient has a background of type 2 diabetes and fundoscopic signs consistent with diabetic neuropathy - the presence of hard exudates and scattered haemorrhages.

This patient has a history of hypertension and changes on fundoscopy which should raise suspicion of hypertensive retinopathy. However, the absence of vascular changes such as AV nipping or silver wiring should lower suspicion of hypertensive disease as these are early signs of this condition.

She is generally well but noted some pain behind her right ear yesterday and says her right eye is becoming dry. On examination she has a complete paralysis of the facial nerve on the right side, extending from the forehead to the mouth. Ear, nose and throat examination is normal. Clinical examination of the peripheral nervous system is normal. What is the most likely diagnosis?",

            "The correct answer is <b>Epstein-Barr virus (EBV)</b>. EBV, also known as human herpesvirus 4, has a well-established association with nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC), particularly in Southeast Asian populations. The virus infects epithelial cells and B lymphocytes, leading to latent infection. In nasopharyngeal tissue, EBV can trigger oncogenic transformation through various mechanisms, including the expression of latent viral proteins such as LMP1 and EBNA1, which interfere with cellular signalling pathways and promote carcinogenesis. The virus is detected in nearly all cases of undifferentiated nasopharyngeal carcinoma.<br /><br /><b>Adenovirus</b> is incorrect. Whilst adenoviruses can cause upper respiratory tract infections, conjunctivitis, and gastroenteritis, they have not been associated with nasopharyngeal carcinoma. They are non-enveloped DNA viruses that typically cause self-limiting infections in immunocompetent hosts.<br /><br /><b>Rhinovirus</b> is incorrect. Rhinoviruses are the predominant cause of the common cold and are responsible for many upper respiratory tract infections. They are RNA viruses belonging to the Picornaviridae family and have not been linked to any human cancers.<br /><br /><b>Herpes simplex virus</b> is incorrect. While HSV-1 and HSV-2 are members of the herpesvirus family like EBV, they are not associated with nasopharyngeal carcinoma. HSV typically causes oral and genital lesions and can cause encephalitis in severe cases, but it has not been implicated in nasopharyngeal oncogenesis.<br /><br /><b>Picornavirus</b> is incorrect. Picornaviruses are a family of RNA viruses that include rhinoviruses and enteroviruses. While they can cause various human diseases including respiratory infections, meningitis, and myocarditis, they have not been associated with the development of nasopharyngeal carcinoma or any other human cancers.",
