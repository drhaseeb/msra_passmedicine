A raised ALP in the presence of otherwise normal LFT's should make you consider bony malignancy in view of the history of lethargy, back pain and feeling unwell in an elderly patient. The back pain could potentially be due to bony metastases, this is common particularly in prostate cancer. Other causes of raised ALP include: Paget's disease, osteomalacia, rickets, bone fractures, primary bone tumours, pregnancy (as it is released by the placenta). Other tests you may wish to consider include: PTH, calcium, PSA and a skeletal survey.<br /><br />Hepatocellular carcinoma would cause deranged LFT's in the vast majority of cases. You would not expect a sole rise in ALP.<br /><br />Hepatitis would also cause deranged LFT's, although ALP would be raised so would ALT. You would not expect a sole rise in ALP.<br /><br />In primary sclerosing cholangitis, ALP is significantly raised but ALT is usually 2-3 times the normal limit as well.<br /><br />In the case of gallstones, deranged LFTs may or may not be seen depending on the location of the gallstone and if the patient is symptomatic or not.

            "<b>Nifedipine</b> is the most appropriate choice for this patient. The blood pressure target for an adult under 80 years old with hypertension is blood pressure below 140/90 mmHg. Both clinic and home readings show that this patient's blood pressure is not controlled by a single agent. NICE recommends that, in this instance, treatment adherence is checked. If compliance is good (as in this patient), a second agent should be considered. For a caucasian man under 55 years old, step one of treatment is an angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor (in this case, ramipril) or an angiotensin-II receptor blocker (ARB). Step two of treatment (now required) is the addition of a calcium-channel blocker (CCB) or thiazide-like diuretic. The exact choice depends on clinical factors. This patient has a history of gout, which can be exacerbated by thiazide-like diuretics, such as bendroflumethiazide. For this reason, of the two possible additional drugs listed (bendroflumethiazide or nifedipine, which is a CCB), nifedipine is more appropriate.<br /><br /><b>Bendroflumethiazide</b> can be added to ramipril for stage-2 hypertension treatment. However, it is a less appropriate choice for this patient as it may exacerbate his gout.<br /><br /><b>Doxazosin</b> is an alpha-blocker. Alpha-blockers are not introduced in managing hypertension until stage 4 hypertension, by which point the patient will already be taking three medications. They would not be added for stage 2 hypertension. <br /><br /><b>Losartan</b> is an ARB, which may be used in stage 1 hypertension (in Caucasians under 55) if the patient does not tolerate an ACE inhibitor. ACE inhibitors and ARBs are not used together due to the risk of renal dysfunction. <br /><br /><b>Discuss lifestyle factors and repeat blood pressure in 3 months</b> is not appropriate. Whilst this patient is already taking steps to improve his lifestyle his blood pressure remains above target, suggesting that a single antihypertensive is not adequate. At this stage, NICE recommends adding a second antihypertensive agent. It is not uncommon for one agent alone to be inadequate at controlling hypertension.",

            "<b>Low-dose dexamethasone suppression test</b> is the correct answer. This patient's presentation with central obesity, new-onset hypertension, easy bruising, fatigue, borderline hypokalaemia, and impaired glucose tolerance (raised HbA1c) is highly suggestive of Cushing's syndrome. According to UK guidelines (e.g., NICE), the first step in the investigation is to confirm the presence of pathological hypercortisolism. The overnight low-dose (1mg) dexamethasone suppression test is the recommended first-line screening test for this purpose. In a healthy individual, exogenous dexamethasone suppresses the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis, leading to a very low serum cortisol level the following morning. In a patient with Cushing's syndrome, this negative feedback mechanism is faulty, and the morning cortisol level remains inappropriately high (i.e., it fails to suppress). This test has high sensitivity and is convenient for the patient. Alternative first-line tests include 24-hour urinary free cortisol or late-night salivary cortisol, but the dexamethasone suppression test is most commonly used in primary and secondary care settings to begin the diagnostic pathway.<br /><br /><b>High-dose dexamethasone suppression test</b> is an incorrect choice at this stage. This is a second-line investigation used to help determine the <i>cause</i> of Cushing's syndrome after the diagnosis has already been confirmed by a first-line test. It helps to differentiate between a pituitary source of ACTH (Cushing's disease), which typically shows suppression of cortisol with a high dose of dexamethasone, and an ectopic ACTH-producing tumour or an adrenal tumour, which usually do not suppress. Performing this test before confirming the presence of hypercortisolism is inappropriate and not in line with the standard diagnostic algorithm.<br /><br /><b>Plasma ACTH level</b> is also an investigation used for localisation rather than initial diagnosis. Once Cushing's syndrome is confirmed biochemically, an ACTH level is measured to differentiate between ACTH-dependent causes (pituitary adenoma, ectopic ACTH production) and ACTH-independent causes (adrenal adenoma/carcinoma). If the ACTH level is suppressed, the cause is likely adrenal. If it is normal or elevated, the cause is ACTH-dependent. It is a crucial step, but it follows, and does not precede, the confirmation of hypercortisolism.<br /><br /><b>Abdominal CT scan</b> is an imaging modality used for localisation, not for initial diagnosis. It would be an appropriate investigation if Cushing's syndrome were confirmed and the plasma ACTH level was found to be suppressed, suggesting an adrenal source. Performing imaging prematurely can be misleading, as it may reveal a non-functioning adrenal incidentaloma, which is common in the general population and could lead to unnecessary further investigations and patient anxiety. The principle is to always establish the biochemical diagnosis before proceeding to imaging.<br /><br /><b>24-hour urinary metanephrines</b> is the first-line investigation for phaeochromocytoma. While this is an important differential diagnosis for a patient presenting with new-onset hypertension, the constellation of other symptoms in this case (central weight gain, easy bruising) and biochemical abnormalities (hypokalaemia, impaired glucose tolerance) points much more strongly towards Cushing's syndrome. Phaeochromocytoma typically presents with more episodic symptoms like palpitations, headaches, and sweating. Therefore, investigating for Cushing's syndrome is the most logical and high-yield next step.",

Her last menstrual period was 2 weeks ago. During her follow-up, she reports no significant new symptoms but is concerned about the potential side effects of tamoxifen. She has no significant past medical history. <br /><br />What is the most likely side effect of this medication?",

            "The correct answer is <b>venous thromboembolism (VTE)</b>. VTE is a serious side effect of tamoxifen use. Tamoxifen\u2019s pro-oestrogenic effects on the liver increase clotting factors, leading to a hypercoagulable state. This risk is greater in women who are immobilised, undergoing surgery or have other VTE risk factors. Although the patient does not have personal or family VTE risk factors, the baseline VTE risk with tamoxifen is still elevated.<br /><br /><b>Acute kidney injury (AKI)</b> is incorrect. Tamoxifen is not associated with AKI. AKI can occur due to a variety of causes, including dehydration, nephrotoxic medications, or other underlying medical conditions, but tamoxifen does not directly affect kidney function. The more concerning risks associated with tamoxifen are related to VTE formation, not renal toxicity. Therefore, this option is incorrect.<br /><br /><b>Arthralgia</b> is incorrect. While arthralgia (joint pain) is a common side effect of aromatase inhibitors, such as anastrozole, it is not typically associated with tamoxifen. Tamoxifen\u2019s mechanism of action involves selective oestrogen receptor modulation, which does not cause the same level of joint discomfort seen with oestrogen depletion from aromatase inhibitors. Thus, tamoxifen is not associated with significant joint pain.<br /><br /><b>Osteoporosis</b> is incorrect. Tamoxifen has a bone-protective effect, particularly in premenopausal women, due to its selective oestrogen receptor modulation activity. It mimics the effects of oestrogen on bone, helping maintain bone density. This is the opposite of what is seen with aromatase inhibitors, such as anastrozole, which can cause bone loss and osteoporosis. Tamoxifen is not associated with an increased risk of osteoporosis and may help preserve bone health instead.<br /><br /><b>Weight gain</b> is incorrect. Weight gain may occur during cancer treatment, but it is not directly caused by tamoxifen. Factors such as reduced activity, dietary changes, menopause, or stress are more likely contributors. Tamoxifen may cause some fluid retention, but it is not directly linked to significant or concerning weight gain. Patients should still be advised to maintain a healthy diet and exercise routine during treatment.",

            "The correct answer is <b>Spironolactone</b>. Spironolactone is a potassium-sparing diuretic that also acts as an aldosterone antagonist. It has anti-androgen effects which can lead to gynaecomastia, a condition characterised by enlargement of the breast tissue in males. This is due to the drug's ability to inhibit androgen receptors, leading to an imbalance between oestrogen and testosterone levels. The incidence of spironolactone-induced gynaecomastia varies but can be as high as 10% in some studies.<br /><br /><b>Tamsulosin</b> is an alpha-blocker primarily used in the management of benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH). While it can cause side effects such as dizziness, headache and postural hypotension, it does not typically cause gynaecomastia.<br /><br /><b>Phenytoin</b>, an antiepileptic drug, has many side effects including gingival hyperplasia, hirsutism and folate deficiency; however, gynaecomastia is not commonly associated with its use.<br /><br /><b>Mirtazapine</b> is an antidepressant that works by antagonising central alpha-2 adrenergic receptors. It may cause weight gain and sedation but it does not usually cause gynaecomastia.<br /><br />Finally, <b>Lansoprazole</b>, a proton pump inhibitor used for conditions like gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD) and peptic ulcer disease, may have side effects including diarrhoea, nausea and abdominal pain but it does not typically result in gynaecomastia.<br /><br />In conclusion, while all the drugs listed could potentially have numerous side effects based on their mechanisms of action and pharmacokinetics, only Spironolactone has a strong association with causing gynaecomastia due to its anti-androgenic properties.",

            "The history of a progressive painful neurological deficit (legs giving way) that improves on rest or leaning forwards is highly suggestive of lumbar spinal canal stenosis. Symptoms are caused by nerve root ischaemia due to the stenosis causing inadequate microvascular blood flow to the spinal nerve roots. The effect of this is a bilateral neuropathic pain and progressive deficit affecting the dermatomes and myotomes below the affected level. Leaning forward can improve spinal stenosis as it makes the canal wider than when standing up and resting improves symptoms as it reduces the oxygen requirement of the nerve roots so the ischaemia slowly resolves. As the symptoms are only brought on by consistent use of the nerve roots, there is normally no abnormal findings on neurological examination of the legs.<br /><br />Osteoarthritis is a degenerative arthropathy that most commonly affects large weight-bearing joints in the lower limbs such as the hip or knee. It often causes pain which can limit exercise but rarely improves with rest and is not associated with a neurological deficit so is incorrect. Additionally, osteoarthritis is usually unilateral and does not cause symmetrical symptoms.<br /><br />Peripheral neuropathy can produce a similar set of symptoms to spinal stenosis with pain and leg weakness when walking. However, as the pathology in peripheral neuropathy is not related to nerve use, a deficit (usually sensory) would be detected on examination. The normal examination in this scenario indicates it is not peripheral neuropathy.<br /><br />Peripheral vascular disease is the most likely differential for patients with spinal stenosis and the symptoms of progressive leg pain which is relieved by rest are usually identical. However, when peripheral vascular disease is bad enough to cause symptoms after relatively short distances of walking, you will find evidence of vascular insufficiency on examination. There may be absent distal pulses, ulceration or skin changes and the absence of these points away from peripheral vascular disease as the cause.

        "question": "A 51-year-old man visits his GP due to difficulty walking. He reports that after walking approximately 500m he gets pain in both calves and feet that becomes progressively worse and eventually results in his legs giving way. The pain settles completely on sitting and resting for a few minutes and he finds that leaning forward allows him to walk further before the pain comes on. He has no past medical history and examination of his lower limbs is normal.<br /><br />What is the likely diagnosis?",

        "body": "Lumbar spinal stenosis is a condition in which the central canal is narrowed by tumour, disk prolapse or other similar degenerative changes. <br /><br />Patients may present with a combination of back pain, neuropathic pain and symptoms mimicking <span class=\"concept\" data-cid=\"10560\">claudication</span>. One of the main features that may help to differentiate it from true claudication in the history is the positional element to the pain. <span class=\"concept\" data-cid=\"2367\">Sitting is better than standing and patients may find it easier to walk uphill rather than downhill</span>. The neurogenic claudication type history makes lumbar spinal stenosis a likely underlying diagnosis, the absence of such symptoms makes it far less likely. <br /><br /><h5 class='notes-heading'>Pathology</h5><br />Degenerative disease is the commonest underlying cause. Degeneration is believed to begin in the intervertebral disk where biochemical changes such as cell death and loss of proteoglycan and water content lead to progressive disk bulging and collapse. This process leads to an increased stress transfer to the posterior facet joints, which accelerates cartilaginous degeneration, hypertrophy, and osteophyte formation; this is associated with thickening and distortion of the ligamentum flavum. The combination of the ventral disk bulging, osteophyte formation at the dorsal facet, and ligamentum flavum hyptertrophy combine to circumferentially narrow the spinal canal and the space available for the neural elements. The compression of the nerve roots of the cauda equina leads to the characteristic clinical signs and symptoms of lumbar spinal stenosis.<br /><br /><h5 class='notes-heading'>Diagnosis</h5><br /><span class=\"concept\" data-cid=\"1719\">MRI scanning</span> is the best modality for demonstrating the canal narrowing. Historically a bicycle test was used as true vascular claudicants could not complete the test.<br /><br /><h5 class='notes-heading'>Treatment</h5><br />Laminectomy",
