It occurs due to surfactant deficiency and causes alveolar collapse after expiration.  It is most commonly seen in premature and low birth weight babies. <br /><br />Pneumothorax in the neonatal period is most commonly associated with premature babies with RDS.  It may occur as a complication of continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP).  Examination findings include tachypnoea, reduced expansion, hyperresonance and reduced breath sounds on the affected side.<br /><br />Neonatal pneumonia may be contracted in utero and present at birth, or can be acquired following delivery.  It is usually bacterial in origin and caused by organisms such as group B streptococcus (GBS).  Early features include respiratory distress, poor feeding and temperature instability.  Risk factors include maternal GBS, prolonged rupture of membranes, prematurity and maternal temperature in labour.<br /><br />TOF is a connection between the oesophagus and trachea.

            "The correct answer is <b>Squamous cell cancer</b>. PUVA therapy, which involves the use of psoralen (a photosensitizing medication) and ultraviolet A light, has been associated with an increased risk of squamous cell carcinoma. This is due to the mutagenic effect of UVA radiation on keratinocytes when used in conjunction with psoralen. The risk is particularly high in patients who have received a high cumulative dose of PUVA or those who have fair skin.<br /><br /><b>Osteoporosis</b> is not typically associated with PUVA therapy. Osteoporosis is primarily related to age, hormonal changes especially in post-menopausal women, low body mass index, smoking, excessive alcohol intake and lack of physical activity among others. It's important to note that corticosteroids, which are sometimes used in the management of severe skin conditions like psoriasis can lead to osteoporosis but this is not directly linked to PUVA therapy.<br /><br /><b>Basal cell cancer</b> although it's a type of non-melanoma skin cancer like squamous cell carcinoma, it's less frequently associated with PUVA compared to squamous cell carcinoma. Basal cell carcinomas are more commonly linked with chronic sun exposure and use of tanning beds.<br /><br /><b>Dermoid cysts</b> are benign tumours that often contain structures such as hair, fluid, teeth or skin glands. They are most commonly found on the ovaries in women or near the lateral eyebrows in children. Dermoid cysts are not associated with PUVA therapy.<br /><br />Finally, <b>Malignant melanoma</b>, though a serious form of skin cancer, its association with PUVA therapy remains controversial and unclear. Some studies suggest a possible link while others don't. However, it's generally agreed that people receiving any form of phototherapy should be regularly screened for all types of skin cancers including malignant melanoma as part of good clinical practice.<br />",
