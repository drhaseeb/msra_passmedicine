            "The correct answer is <b>Widening of the QRS complex</b>. Hyperkalaemia, defined as a serum potassium level greater than 5.5 mmol/L, can cause several ECG changes. The most consistent and life-threatening change is widening of the QRS complex. This represents delayed ventricular depolarisation due to impaired sodium conductance across cell membranes.

            "The correct answer is <b>Sick sinus syndrome</b>. Donepezil, a cholinesterase inhibitor, is commonly used in the management of Alzheimer's disease. However, it can increase vagal tone and cause bradycardia. In patients with sick sinus syndrome - a group of heart rhythm disorders where the sinus node doesn't work properly - this could lead to severe symptomatic bradycardia or even sinus arrest. Therefore, donepezil should be used with caution in these patients.<br /><br /><b>History of depression</b> is not a contraindication to the use of donepezil. Depression is common in patients with Alzheimer's disease and there is no evidence that donepezil exacerbates depressive symptoms. In fact, some studies suggest that it may improve neuropsychiatric symptoms in some individuals.<br /><br /><b>Concurrent simvastatin therapy</b> is also not a contraindication. While both drugs are metabolised by cytochrome P450 enzymes, they do not share the same subtypes and therefore significant drug interactions are unlikely.<br /><br /><b>Concurrent citalopram therapy</b> does not contraindicate the use of donepezil either.

        "question": "A 76-year-old woman is diagnosed with Alzheimer's disease. Which one of the following could be a contraindication to the prescription of donepezil?",
        "correct_answer": "2",
        "question_notes": "The correct answer is <b>Sick sinus syndrome</b>. Donepezil, a cholinesterase inhibitor, is commonly used in the management of Alzheimer's disease. However, it can increase vagal tone and cause bradycardia. In patients with sick sinus syndrome - a group of heart rhythm disorders where the sinus node doesn't work properly - this could lead to severe symptomatic bradycardia or even sinus arrest. Therefore, donepezil should be used with caution in these patients.<br /><br /><b>History of depression</b> is not a contraindication to the use of donepezil. Depression is common in patients with Alzheimer's disease and there is no evidence that donepezil exacerbates depressive symptoms. In fact, some studies suggest that it may improve neuropsychiatric symptoms in some individuals.<br /><br /><b>Concurrent simvastatin therapy</b> is also not a contraindication. While both drugs are metabolised by cytochrome P450 enzymes, they do not share the same subtypes and therefore significant drug interactions are unlikely.<br /><br /><b>Concurrent citalopram therapy</b> does not contraindicate the use of donepezil either.

It is typically used in the management of type 2 diabetes mellitus. <br /><br />Bromocriptine is incorrect; this is a dopamine agonist which inhibits the release of prolactin and is therefore used in the management of prolactinoma.

If we just rely on clinic readings then such patients may be diagnosed as having hypertension when, the vast majority of the time, their blood pressure is normal.<br /><br />This has led to the use of both ambulatory blood pressure monitoring (ABPM) and home blood pressure monitoring (HBPM) to confirm the diagnosis of hypertension. These techniques allow a more accurate assessment of a patients' overall blood pressure. Not only does this help prevent overdiagnosis of hypertension - ABPM has been shown to be a more accurate predictor of cardiovascular events than clinic readings.<br /><br /><h5 class='notes-heading'>Blood pressure classification</h5><br />This becomes relevant later in some of the management decisions that NICE advocate.<br /><br /><div class=\"table-responsive\"><table class = \"tlarge table table-striped table-bordered\"  data-role=\"table\" id=\"tableid1\" ><thead><tr><th><b>Stage</b></th><th><b>Criteria</b></th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td><b>Stage 1 hypertension</b></td><td>Clinic BP >= 140/90 mmHg and subsequent ABPM daytime average or HBPM average BP >= 135/85 mmHg</td></tr><tr><td><b>Stage 2 hypertension</b></td><td>Clinic BP >= 160/100 mmHg and subsequent ABPM daytime average or HBPM average BP >= 150/95 mmHg</td></tr><tr><td><b>Severe hypertension</b></td><td>Clinic systolic BP >= 180 mmHg, or clinic diastolic BP >= 120 mmHg</td></tr></tbody></table></div><br /><h5 class='notes-heading'>Diagnosing hypertension</h5><br />Firstly, NICE recommend measuring blood pressure in both arms when considering a diagnosis of hypertension. <br /><br />If the difference in readings between arms is more than 20 mmHg then the measurements should be repeated. If the difference remains > 20 mmHg then subsequent blood pressures should be recorded from the arm with the higher reading.<br /><br />It should of course be remember that there are pathological causes of unequal blood pressure readings from the arms, such as supravalvular aortic stenosis. It is therefore prudent to listen to the heart sounds if a difference exists and further investigation if a very large difference is noted.<br /><br />NICE also recommend taking a second reading during the consultation, if the first reading is > 140/90 mmHg. The lower reading of the two should determine further management.<br /><br />NICE suggest offering ABPM or HBPM to any patient with a blood pressure >= 140/90 mmHg.<br /><br />If the blood pressure is >= 180/120 mmHg:<br /><ul><li>admit for specialist assessment if:<ul><li><span class=\"concept\" data-cid=\"10965\">signs of retinal haemorrhage or papilloedema (accelerated hypertension)</span> or</li><li>life-threatening symptoms such as <span class=\"concept\" data-cid=\"10966\">new-onset confusion, chest pain, signs of heart failure, or acute kidney injury</span></li></ul></li><li>NICE also recommend referral if a phaeochromocytoma is suspected (labile or postural hypotension, headache, palpitations, pallor and diaphoresis)</li><li>if none of the above then arrange <span class=\"concept\" data-cid=\"10967\">urgent investigations for end-organ damage</span> (e.g. bloods, urine ACR, ECG)<ul><li>if target organ damage is identified, consider starting antihypertensive drug treatment immediately, without waiting for the results of ABPM or HBPM.</li><li>if no target organ damage is identified, repeat clinic blood pressure measurement within 7 days</li></ul></li></ul><br />Ambulatory blood pressure monitoring (ABPM)<br /><ul><li>at least 2 measurements per hour during the person's usual waking hours (for example, between 08:00 and 22:00)</li><li>use the average value of at least 14 measurements</li></ul><br />If ABPM is not tolerated or declined HBPM should be offered.<br /><br />Home blood pressure monitoring (HBPM)<br /><ul><li>for each BP recording, two consecutive measurements need to be taken, at least 1 minute apart and with the person seated</li><li>BP should be recorded twice daily, ideally in the morning and evening</li><li>BP should be recorded for at least 4 days, ideally for 7 days</li><li>discard the measurements taken on the first day and use the average value of all the remaining measurements</li></ul><br /><h5 class='notes-heading'>Interpreting the results</h5><br />ABPM/HBPM >= 135/85 mmHg (i.e. stage 1 hypertension)<br /><ul><li>treat if < 80 years of age AND any of the following apply; target organ damage, established cardiovascular disease, renal disease, diabetes or a 10-year cardiovascular risk equivalent to 10% or greater</li><li>in 2019, NICE made a further recommendation, suggesting that we should <i>'consider antihypertensive drug treatment in addition to lifestyle advice for adults aged under 60 with stage 1 hypertension and an estimated 10-year risk below 10%.
