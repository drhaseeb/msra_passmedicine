            "<b>Essential tremor</b> is the correct diagnosis. This is the most common movement disorder. The patient's presentation is classical. The tremor is postural, meaning it is most prominent when the limbs are held in a fixed position against gravity, such as holding a cup or writing, and is typically absent at rest. It is usually bilateral and symmetrical, affecting both hands. A key feature is the strong family history, as essential tremor is often inherited in an autosomal dominant pattern, which is suggested by the patient's father having a similar problem. Another highly specific feature mentioned is the improvement of symptoms with a small amount of alcohol. The absence of other neurological signs, specifically bradykinesia and rigidity, helps to differentiate it from other causes of tremor like Parkinson's disease. Management is often not required if symptoms are mild, but first-line treatment according to UK guidelines is propranolol or primidone.<br /><br /><b>Parkinson's disease</b> is a key differential but is less likely here. The classic Parkinsonian tremor is a resting tremor, which is present when the limb is fully supported and at rest. It typically diminishes or disappears with voluntary movement, which is the opposite of the postural tremor described in this scenario. Parkinson's disease tremor is often asymmetrical at onset, starting in one limb before spreading. Crucially, a diagnosis of Parkinson's disease requires the presence of bradykinesia (slowness of movement) in addition to either tremor or rigidity. The scenario explicitly states that these features were absent on examination.<br /><br /><b>Cerebellar disease</b> is an important cause of tremor, but it typically manifests as an intention tremor. This type of tremor is absent at rest and during the initial phase of a movement but worsens significantly as the individual approaches a target (e.g., during finger-nose testing). This is distinct from the postural tremor described. Furthermore, cerebellar disease would usually be accompanied by other signs of cerebellar dysfunction, such as dysdiadochokinesia (inability to perform rapid alternating movements), ataxia (unsteady gait), nystagmus, or dysarthria (slurred speech), none of which are mentioned in the presentation.<br /><br /><b>Physiological tremor</b> is a fine, high-frequency tremor that is present in all healthy individuals but is usually not visible. It can become more prominent (enhanced physiological tremor) due to factors such as anxiety, fatigue, caffeine intake, or certain metabolic conditions like thyrotoxicosis. While it is a postural tremor, it is not typically associated with a strong family history or a dramatic improvement with alcohol. It is less likely to be the primary presenting complaint in a 68-year-old without a clear precipitating factor.<br /><br /><b>Drug-induced tremor</b> is a common cause of tremor and should always be considered. It is typically a postural tremor. However, this diagnosis requires a history of exposure to a causative medication, such as sodium valproate, lithium, beta-agonists (e.g., salbutamol), or amiodarone. The scenario provides no such medication history. While it's important to take a full drug history, the combination of a positive family history and improvement with alcohol makes essential tremor a much more likely primary diagnosis.",

            "The clinical presentation is classical for an acute attack of gout. The question asks for the most likely precipitant among his regular medications.<br /><br /><b>Indapamide</b> is the correct answer. Indapamide is a thiazide-like diuretic. Thiazide and thiazide-like diuretics are a well-established cause of hyperuricaemia, which can precipitate attacks of gout. They are thought to increase uric acid levels by increasing its reabsorption in the proximal convoluted tubule, possibly through competition for the same organic acid transporter system. The temporal relationship is key in this scenario; the patient's symptoms developed four weeks after the initiation of indapamide, making it the most probable trigger for his first presentation of gout.<br /><br /><b>Amlodipine</b> is a calcium channel blocker used for hypertension and angina. Its common side effects include headache, flushing, and peripheral oedema (typically ankle swelling). While it causes swelling, this is due to vasodilation and fluid transudation, not an acute inflammatory arthritis. Amlodipine is not associated with hyperuricaemia or precipitating gout, making it an unlikely cause of this patient's symptoms.<br /><br /><b>Aspirin</b> is a very plausible distractor. At low doses (75-325 mg daily), as used for secondary cardiovascular prevention, aspirin can cause hyperuricaemia by inhibiting the renal tubular secretion of uric acid. Therefore, it can precipitate gout. However, the patient has a history of ischaemic heart disease and has likely been taking aspirin long-term. The most significant recent event is the addition of indapamide. In clinical practice, a newly introduced medication is a more likely precipitant than a long-standing one, although aspirin remains a potential contributing factor.<br /><br /><b>Atorvastatin</b> is an HMG-CoA reductase inhibitor (statin). The most well-known side effects are muscle-related, such as myalgia and, rarely, myositis. While arthralgia is a recognised but less common side effect, statins are not associated with causing an acute inflammatory monoarthritis typical of gout. In fact, some observational studies suggest that statins may have a modest urate-lowering effect and could potentially reduce the risk of gout attacks.<br /><br /><b>Bisoprolol</b> is a cardioselective beta-blocker. While diuretics are strongly linked with gout, the evidence for beta-blockers is much weaker and less consistent. They are not considered a common or significant precipitant for gout, especially when compared to the well-documented risk associated with thiazide-like diuretics like indapamide. Therefore, it is a much less likely cause in this patient.",

            "The correct answer is <b>Diastolic murmur</b>. Innocent murmurs, also known as physiological or functional murmurs, are heart sounds produced when the blood flows rapidly through the heart and vessels. They are typically heard during systole - the phase of the heartbeat when the heart muscle contracts and pumps blood from the chambers into the arteries. Diastolic murmurs, on the other hand, occur during diastole - when the heart relaxes and fills with blood. These are usually indicative of structural heart disease such as aortic or mitral stenosis or regurgitation.<br /><br />Discussing each of the incorrect options:<br /><br /><b>Short buzzing murmur in the aortic area</b>: This description is consistent with an innocent murmur. An innocent murmur can be described as short (less than half of systole), soft, and often vibratory or musical ('buzzing').<br /><br /><b>Soft-blowing murmur in the pulmonary area</b>: This characteristic is also typical for an innocent murmur. They are often best heard at left upper sternal border (pulmonary area) and they have a soft blowing quality.<br /><br /><b>Varies with posture</b>: The intensity and character of an innocent murmur can change with changes in body position. For example, it can become softer or disappear altogether when moving from standing to lying down.<br /><br /><b>Continuous blowing noise heard just below the clavicles</b>: This could describe a venous hum, which is considered an innocent sound. It's caused by turbulent blood flow in jugular veins and is typically heard just below clavicles.<br />   <br />Innocent murmurs are common in children and usually do not require treatment unless they cause symptoms or complications. However, any new-onset murmur should be evaluated carefully to rule out underlying cardiac pathology.",
