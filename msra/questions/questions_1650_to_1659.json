            "The correct answer is <b>Advice on diet/fluid intake + Movicol Paediatric Plain</b>. This choice is the most appropriate first-line intervention for a child with chronic constipation according to NICE guidelines. The guidance suggests an oral macrogol (such as Movicol Paediatric Plain) in combination with advice about diet and fluid intake. Macrogols are osmotic laxatives that increase the amount of water in the bowels, softening stools and making them easier to pass.<br /><br /><b>Advice on diet/fluid intake + lactulose</b> is not the best answer because lactulose, although an osmotic laxative, is less effective than macrogols and can cause bloating and flatulence. It's usually reserved for when macrogols cannot be tolerated or are ineffective.<br /><br /><b>Advice on diet/fluid intake</b> alone may not be enough to manage this boy's constipation. While increasing fibre and fluid intake can help prevent constipation, it may not be sufficient to relieve existing symptoms in a child who has been passing hard stools every 4-5 days.<br /><br /><b>Advice on diet/fluid intake + refer to local Constipation Nurse for support</b> could be useful if initial treatments fail or if there are complications such as faecal impaction. However, referral should not be the first-line intervention. According to NICE guidelines, children with uncomplicated constipation should initially be managed in primary care.<br /><br />Finally, <b>Advice on diet/fluid intake + senna</b> isn't recommended as a first-line treatment either.

        "body": "The frequency at which children open their bowels varies widely but generally decreases with age from a mean of 3 times per day for infants under 6 months old to once a day after 3 years of age.<br /><br />NICE produced guidelines in 2010 on the diagnosis and management of constipation in children. A diagnosis of constipation is suggested by 2 or more of the following:<br /><br /><div class=\"table-responsive\"><table class = \"tlarge table table-striped table-bordered\"  data-role=\"table\" id=\"tableid1\" ><thead><tr><th></th><th><b>Child < 1 year</b></th><th><b>Child > 1 year</b></th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td><b>Stool pattern</b></td><td>Fewer than 3 complete stools per week (type 3 or 4 on Bristol Stool Form Scale) (this does not apply to exclusively breastfed babies after 6 weeks<br />of age)<br /> Hard large stool<br /> 'Rabbit droppings' (type 1)</td><td>Fewer than 3 complete stools per week (type 3 or 4)<br /> Overflow soiling (commonly very loose, very smelly, stool passed without sensation)<br /> 'Rabbit droppings' (type 1)<br /> Large, infrequent stools that can block the toilet</td></tr><tr><td><b>Symptoms associated with defecation</b></td><td>Distress on passing stool<br /> Bleeding associated with hard stool<br /> Straining</td><td>Poor appetite that improves with passage of large stool<br /> Waxing and waning of abdominal pain with passage of stool<br /> Evidence of retentive posturing: typical straight-legged, tiptoed, back arching<br />posture<br /> Straining<br /> Anal pain</td></tr><tr><td><b>History</b></td><td>Previous episode(s) of constipation<br /> Previous or current anal fissure</td><td>Previous episode(s) of constipation<br /> Previous or current anal fissure<br /> Painful bowel movements and bleeding associated with hard stools</td></tr></tbody></table></div><br />The vast majority of children have no identifiable cause - idiopathic constipation. Other causes of constipation in children include:<br /><ul><li>dehydration</li><li>low-fibre diet</li><li>medications: e.g. Opiates</li><li>anal fissure</li><li>over-enthusiastic potty training</li><li>hypothyroidism</li><li>Hirschsprung's disease</li><li>hypercalcaemia</li><li>learning disabilities</li></ul><br /><br />After making a diagnosis of constipation NICE then suggesting excluding secondary causes. If no red or amber flags are present then a diagnosis of idiopathic constipation can be made:<br /><br /><div class=\"table-responsive\"><table class = \"tlarge table table-striped table-bordered\"  data-role=\"table\" id=\"tableid2\" ><thead><tr><th></th><th><b>Indicates idiopathic constipation</b></th><th><b>'Red flag' suggesting underlying disorder</b></th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td><b>Timing</b></td><td>Starts after a few weeks of life<br /> Obvious precipitating factors coinciding with the start of symptoms: fissure, change of diet, timing of potty/toilet training or acute events such as infections, moving house, starting nursery/school, fears and phobias, major change in family, taking medicines</td><td>Reported from birth or first few weeks of life</td></tr><tr><td><b>Passage of meconium</b></td><td>< 48 hours</td><td>> 48 hours</td></tr><tr><td><b>Stool pattern</b></td><td></td><td>'Ribbon' stools</td></tr><tr><td><b>Growth</b></td><td>Generally well, weight and height within normal limits, fit and active</td><td>Faltering growth is an <b>amber</b> flag</td></tr><tr><td><b>Neuro/locomotor</b></td><td>No neurological problems in legs, normal locomotor development</td><td>Previously unknown or undiagnosed weakness in legs, locomotor delay</td></tr><tr><td><b>Abdomen</b></td><td></td><td>Distension</td></tr><tr><td><b>Diet</b></td><td>Changes in infant formula, weaning, insufficient fluid intake or poor diet<br /></td><td></td></tr><tr><td><b>Other</b></td><td></td><td><b>Amber</b> flag: Disclosure or evidence that raises concerns over possibility of child maltreatment</td></tr></tbody></table></div><br />Prior to starting treatment, the child needs to be assessed for faecal impaction. Factors which suggest faecal impaction include:<br /><ul><li>symptoms of severe constipation</li><li>overflow soiling</li><li>faecal mass palpable in the abdomen (digital rectal examination should only be carried out by a specialist)</li></ul><br /><h5 class='notes-heading'>NICE guidelines on management</h5><br />If faecal impaction is present<br /><ul><li><span class=\"concept\" data-cid=\"266\">polyethylene glycol 3350 + electrolytes (Movicol Paediatric Plain)</span> using an escalating dose regimen as the first-line treatment</li><li>add a stimulant laxative if Movicol Paediatric Plain does not lead to disimpaction after 2 weeks</li><li>substitute a stimulant laxative singly or in combination with an osmotic laxative such as lactulose if Movicol Paediatric Plain is not tolerated</li><li>inform families that disimpaction treatment can initially increase symptoms of soiling and abdominal pain</li></ul><br />Maintenance therapy<br /><ul><li>very similar to the above regime, with obvious adjustments to the starting dose, i.e. </li><li>first-line: Movicol Paediatric Plain</li><li>add a stimulant laxative if no response</li><li>substitute a stimulant laxative if Movicol Paediatric Plain is not tolerated.

            "<b>She must not drive for 6 months</b> is the correct answer. Following a first unprovoked or isolated seizure, UK DVLA regulations stipulate that patients must refrain from driving for 6 months, provided that brain imaging and EEG show no relevant structural abnormalities or definite epileptiform activity. In this case, both the CT head and EEG are normal, meeting these criteria. The patient must inform the DVLA of the seizure. This 6-month period allows time to assess whether this was truly an isolated event or the first manifestation of epilepsy. If the patient remains seizure-free during this period and investigations remain normal, driving can resume. This balance protects both the individual and public safety whilst not imposing unnecessarily prolonged restrictions on those with a genuinely isolated seizure.<br /><br /><b>She can drive immediately as investigations are normal</b> is incorrect. Despite normal investigations, DVLA regulations mandate a period off driving following any seizure. The normal investigations determine the length of the driving ban (6 months rather than 12 months) but do not eliminate the requirement for a period of observation. Immediate return to driving would pose an unacceptable risk of recurrence whilst operating a vehicle.<br /><br /><b>She must not drive for 1 month</b> is incorrect. This duration applies to patients who have suffered a stroke or TIA without residual neurological deficit. It does not apply to seizures, which carry different risks regarding sudden loss of consciousness and control whilst driving. The unpredictable nature of seizure recurrence necessitates a longer observation period.<br /><br /><b>She must not drive for 3 months</b> is incorrect.

Three months would provide insufficient time to confidently assess the risk of seizure recurrence.<br /><br /><b>She must not drive for 12 months</b> is incorrect. Whilst this is the standard period for patients with established epilepsy or multiple unprovoked seizures to be seizure-free before driving, it also applies to first seizures where brain imaging shows relevant structural abnormalities or EEG demonstrates definite epileptiform activity.

        "body": "The management of breast cancer depends on the staging, tumour type and patient background. It may involve any of the following:<br /><ul><li>surgery</li><li>radiotherapy</li><li>hormone therapy</li><li>biological therapy</li><li>chemotherapy</li></ul><br /><h5 class='notes-heading'>Surgery</h5><br />The vast majority of patients who have breast cancer diagnosed will be offered surgery. An exception may be a very frail, elderly lady with metastatic disease who may be better managed with hormonal therapy.<br /><br />Prior to surgery, the presence/absence of axillary lymphadenopathy determines management:<br /><ul><li><span class=\"concept\" data-cid=\"10185\">women with no palpable axillary lymphadenopathy at presentation should have a pre-operative axillary ultrasound</span> before their primary surgery<ul><li><span class=\"concept\" data-cid=\"10186\">if negative then they should have a sentinel node biopsy to assess the nodal burden</span></li></ul></li><li><span class=\"concept\" data-cid=\"10189\">in patients with breast cancer who present with clinically palpable lymphadenopathy, axillary node clearance is indicated at primary surgery</span><ul><li><span class=\"concept\" data-cid=\"10191\">this may lead to arm lymphedema and functional arm impairment</span></li></ul></li></ul><br />Depending on the characteristics of the tumour women either have a wide-local excision or a mastectomy. Around two-thirds of tumours can be removed with a wide-local excision. The table below lists some of the factors determining which operation is offered:<br /><br /><div class=\"table-responsive\"><table class = \"tlarge table table-striped table-bordered\"  data-role=\"table\" id=\"tableid1\" ><thead><tr><th><b>Mastectomy</b></th><th><b>Wide Local Excision</b></th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Multifocal tumour</td><td>Solitary lesion</td></tr><tr><td>Central tumour</td><td>Peripheral tumour</td></tr><tr><td>Large lesion in small breast</td><td>Small lesion in large breast</td></tr><tr><td>DCIS > 4cm</td><td>DCIS < 4cm</td></tr></tbody></table></div><br />Women should be offered breast reconstruction to achieve a cosmetically suitable result regardless of the type of operation they have. For women who've had a mastectomy this may be done at the initial operation or at a later date.<br /><br /><h5 class='notes-heading'>Radiotherapy</h5><br /><span class=\"concept\" data-cid=\"9151\">Whole breast radiotherapy is recommended after a woman has had a wide-local excision as this may reduce the risk of recurrence by around two-thirds</span>. For women who've had a mastectomy radiotherapy is offered for T3-T4 tumours and for those with four or more positive axillary nodes<br /><br /><h5 class='notes-heading'>Hormonal therapy</h5><br />Adjuvant hormonal therapy is offered if tumours are positive for hormone receptors. For many years this was done using tamoxifen for 5 years after diagnosis. <span class=\"concept\" data-cid=\"3967\">Tamoxifen is still used in pre- and peri-menopausal women</span>. In <span class=\"concept\" data-cid=\"1261\">post-menopausal women, aromatase inhibitors such as anastrozole</span> are used for this purpose*. This is important as aromatisation accounts for the majority of oestrogen production in post-menopausal women and therefore anastrozole is used for ER +ve breast cancer in this group. <br /><br />Important side effects of tamoxifen include an increased risk of endometrial cancer, venous thromboembolism and menopausal symptoms.<br /><br /><h5 class='notes-heading'>Biological therapy</h5><br />The most common type of biological therapy used for breast cancer is <span class=\"concept\" data-cid=\"3966\">trastuzumab (Herceptin)</span>. It is only useful in the 20-25% of tumours that are <span class=\"concept\" data-cid=\"3966\">HER2 positive</span>.<br /><br />Trastuzumab cannot be used in patients with a history of heart disorders.<br /><br /><h5 class='notes-heading'>Chemotherapy</h5><br />Cytotoxic therapy may be used either prior to surgery ('neoadjuvanant' chemotherapy) to <span class=\"concept\" data-cid=\"10193\">downstage a primary lesion</span> or after surgery depending on the stage of the tumour, for example, if there is <span class=\"concept\" data-cid=\"3968\">axillary node disease - FEC-D is used in this situation</span>.",
