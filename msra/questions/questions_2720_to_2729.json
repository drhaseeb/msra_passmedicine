Nexplanon, also known as the etonogestrel implant, is a long-acting reversible contraceptive device that provides effective contraception for up to three years.

            "The correct answer is <b>Enhances the effect of gamma-aminobutyric acid</b>. Temazepam belongs to a class of drugs known as benzodiazepines. Its mechanism of action involves enhancing the effect of gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA), an inhibitory neurotransmitter in the brain. This enhancement is achieved by increasing the frequency of chloride channel opening within the GABA-A receptor complex, leading to hyperpolarisation of neurons and ultimately decreased neuronal excitability.<br /><br />Discussing the incorrect options:<br /><br /><b>Inhibits the effect of acetylcholine</b> is not correct. Anticholinergic drugs inhibit the effects of acetylcholine, a neurotransmitter involved in many functions including muscle movement, heart rate regulation, learning and memory. Examples include atropine and scopolamine. Temazepam does not have this mechanism.<br /><br /><b>Inhibits the effect gamma-aminobutyric acid</b> is also incorrect. Drugs that inhibit GABA usually increase neuronal activity rather than decrease it, which can lead to seizures or anxiety rather than sedation. An example would be flumazenil, a GABA antagonist used as an antidote for benzodiazepine overdose.<br /><br /><b>Inhibits the effect of glutamate</b> is not correct either. Glutamate is an excitatory neurotransmitter in CNS and its inhibition would indeed result in reduced neuronal activity similar to enhancing GABA's effects. However, temazepam doesn't work by inhibiting glutamate; drugs that do this are typically NMDA receptor antagonists like memantine used in Alzheimer's disease treatment.<br /><br />Finally, <b>Inhibits the effect of noradrenaline</b> is also incorrect. Noradrenaline (norepinephrine) inhibitors are typically used as antihypertensives or antidepressants such as beta-blockers or selective noradrenaline reuptake inhibitors (NARIs). They do not primarily induce sleep or reduce anxiety which are key therapeutic effects of temazepam.<br />",

The Committee on Safety of Medicines advises that benzodiazepines are only prescribed for a short period of time (2-4 weeks).<br /><br />The BNF gives advice on how to withdraw a benzodiazepine. The dose should be withdrawn in steps of about <span class=\"concept\" data-cid=\"12518\">1/8 (range 1/10 to 1/4) of the daily dose every fortnight</span>.

            "<b>Intravenous 0.9% sodium chloride pre- and post-procedure</b> is the most effective intervention for reducing the risk of contrast-induced nephropathy (CIN). This patient has several risk factors for developing CIN: age over 70 years, pre-existing chronic kidney disease stage 3 (as evidenced by his elevated creatinine), and is undergoing a contrast-enhanced CT scan. The current evidence base strongly supports the use of intravenous isotonic fluids as the cornerstone of prevention. Specifically, 0.9% sodium chloride administered at a rate of 1 mL/kg/hour for 12 hours before and after the procedure has been shown to significantly reduce the incidence of CIN. The mechanism is thought to be through expansion of intravascular volume, increased renal blood flow, and enhanced contrast dilution within the tubular lumen, thereby reducing direct toxicity to tubular cells. This approach is recommended in all major guidelines for patients with risk factors for CIN, particularly those with pre-existing renal impairment.<br /><br /><b>Oral sodium bicarbonate pre- and post-procedure</b> is not as effective as intravenous hydration with 0.9% sodium chloride. While intravenous isotonic sodium bicarbonate has shown some benefit in certain studies, the oral route does not provide adequate or reliable hydration to protect against contrast nephropathy. The oral route results in variable absorption and cannot achieve the same level of volume expansion as intravenous fluids. Additionally, the alkalinisation effect of bicarbonate (which may theoretically reduce free radical formation) is less pronounced when administered orally.<br /><br /><b>Oral N-acetylcysteine pre- and post-procedure</b> was previously recommended based on its antioxidant properties and potential to reduce contrast-induced renal damage. However, more recent high-quality evidence, including the PRESERVE trial published in the New England Journal of Medicine in 2018, has demonstrated that N-acetylcysteine provides no significant benefit in preventing CIN. This large randomised controlled trial showed no difference in outcomes between patients who received N-acetylcysteine versus placebo. Current guidelines no longer recommend its routine use for CIN prevention.<br /><br /><b>Intravenous furosemide pre-procedure</b> would actually be harmful rather than protective in this scenario. Loop diuretics like furosemide cause volume depletion and can potentially worsen renal hypoperfusion when contrast media is administered. This would increase rather than decrease the risk of contrast nephropathy. The patient already has risk factors for CIN, and inducing a diuresis before contrast administration would further compromise renal perfusion and exacerbate the nephrotoxic effects of the contrast media.<br /><br /><b>Reducing contrast volume to minimum required dose</b>, while a sensible approach in patients at risk of CIN, is not the most important preventative measure compared to adequate hydration. Although there is a dose-dependent relationship between contrast volume and nephrotoxicity, and minimising contrast dose is considered good practice, this strategy alone is insufficient to prevent CIN in high-risk patients. The evidence for volume reduction is less robust than for intravenous hydration, and it doesn't address the underlying pathophysiological mechanisms as effectively as proper hydration protocols. Additionally, reducing contrast volume too much might compromise diagnostic quality, potentially necessitating repeat examinations and ultimately increasing total contrast exposure.",

            "The correct answer is <b>Acute onset</b>. Acute onset of schizophrenia is associated with a better prognosis compared to insidious or gradual onset. This is because acute onset often follows a stressful event and patients usually have a good premorbid personality and functioning. They are also more likely to respond well to treatment, which improves the overall prognosis.<br /><br />Now let's discuss why the other options are incorrect.<br /><br /><b>Strong family history</b>: While having a strong family history of schizophrenia does increase an individual's risk for developing the disease, it does not correlate with a better prognosis. In fact, some studies suggest that individuals with a strong family history may have more severe symptoms and poorer response to treatment.<br /><br /><b>Low IQ</b>: Low IQ is generally associated with poorer outcomes in schizophrenia. Individuals with lower cognitive abilities may struggle more with managing their symptoms and adhering to treatment plans, leading to worse outcomes over time.<br /><br /><b>Premorbid history of social withdrawal</b>: A premorbid history of social withdrawal is generally associated with worse outcomes in schizophrenia. These individuals often have poorer social skills and fewer support systems in place, which can complicate treatment and recovery efforts.<br /><br /><b>Lack of obvious precipitant</b>: The presence or absence of an obvious precipitant does not significantly impact the prognosis of schizophrenia.
