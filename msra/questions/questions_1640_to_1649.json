            "<b>Basal atelectasis</b> is the correct answer. This patient presents with the classical features of postoperative atelectasis: dyspnoea and hypoxaemia occurring around 72 hours following major abdominal surgery. Atelectasis results from alveolar collapse, typically in the lung bases, caused by obstruction of airways with bronchial secretions. Following upper abdominal surgery, patients often have reduced chest wall movement due to pain, leading to inadequate clearance of secretions and subsequent airway obstruction. The timing (day 3 postoperatively), the clinical presentation of breathlessness with reduced basal air entry, and the mild hypoxaemia without fever are characteristic. The absence of significant fever makes infection less likely. Management involves positioning the patient upright, encouraging deep breathing exercises, and chest physiotherapy to help mobilise secretions and re-expand collapsed alveoli. This is a preventable complication, which is why early mobilisation and adequate analgesia are emphasised in postoperative care.<br /><br /><b>Hospital-acquired pneumonia</b> would typically present with fever, productive cough, and more pronounced systemic features. While it can occur postoperatively, the timing is usually later (typically after 48 hours in hospital), and the patient would be expected to have a higher temperature and raised inflammatory markers. The absence of fever and the specific timing at 72 hours post-surgery make atelectasis more likely than pneumonia in this scenario.<br /><br /><b>Pulmonary embolism</b> is an important differential in any postoperative patient presenting with breathlessness and hypoxaemia. However, PE typically presents more acutely with pleuritic chest pain, and patients often appear more unwell with tachycardia being more prominent. While the timing could fit with PE, the bilateral reduced basal air entry is more consistent with atelectasis. PE would be expected to show clear lung fields or wedge-shaped peripheral opacities on imaging rather than basal changes.<br /><br /><b>Pleural effusion</b> can develop postoperatively, particularly following upper abdominal surgery, but would typically present with stony dull percussion note rather than just reduced air entry. Effusions large enough to cause significant hypoxaemia would usually be visible on chest radiograph as meniscus signs, and the clinical picture would show more pronounced asymmetry if unilateral. The bilateral nature and timing make atelectasis more likely.<br /><br /><b>Acute pulmonary oedema</b> would typically present with more dramatic breathlessness, often with orthopnoea, pink frothy sputum, and widespread crackles on auscultation rather than just reduced air entry at the bases. There is no mention of fluid overload, cardiac history, or features suggesting heart failure. The postoperative timing and clinical findings are much more consistent with atelectasis than cardiac pathology.",

The term transient monocular visual loss (TMVL) describes a sudden, transient loss of vision that lasts less than 24 hours. <br /><br />The most common causes of a sudden painless loss of vision are as follows:<br /><ul><li>ischaemic/vascular (e.g. thrombosis, embolism, temporal arteritis etc). This includes recognised syndromes e.g. occlusion of central retinal vein and occlusion of central retinal artery</li><li>vitreous haemorrhage</li><li>retinal detachment</li><li><span class=\"concept\" data-cid=\"4503\">retinal migraine</span></li></ul><br />Ischaemic/vascular<br /><ul><li>often referred to as 'amaurosis fugax'</li><li>wide differential including large artery disease (atherothrombosis, embolus, dissection), small artery occlusive disease (anterior ischemic optic neuropathy, vasculitis e.g. temporal arteritis), venous disease and hypoperfusion</li><li>may represent a form of <span class=\"concept\" data-cid=\"8607\">transient ischaemic attack</span> (TIA).

            "The correct answer is sigmoid volvulus. This patient is presenting with intense abdominal pain and constipation, two cardinal signs of acute bowel obstruction, in this case, due to volvulus. In this x-ray, we can notice a large, dilated loop of the large bowel. The dilation causes the classic coffee-bean sign, a pathognomonic of sigmoid volvulus.  <br /><br />A caecal volvulus would cause signs and symptoms of small bowel obstruction rather than large bowel. The patient would be more likely to vomit and the x-ray would underline enlargement of the small bowel. <br /><br />Ischemic colitis presents usually with a normal x-ray. The standard diagnostic tool for it is an angiogram. It is caused by a reduced blood supply to the gut and one of the major risk factors for it is atrial fibrillation. <br /><br />Pneumoperitoneum means free air in the abdomen. It can be diagnosed with an erect abdominal x-ray, that shows air under the diaphragm. One of the classic signs of pneumoperitoneum is the Rigler's sign, where you can observe both walls of the bowel. If there is free abdominal gas adjacent to a gas-filled loop of the bowel then both sides of the bowel wall are well-defined. Its absence in this case, together with normal vitals make the diagnosis unlikely. <br /><br />Toxic megacolon is a localised or pancolonic dilatation with systemic features. It can be due to infection or severe inflammation such as a severe flare of inflammatory bowel disease. On x-ray, you would observe a dilated portion of the colon, specifically, it needs to be dilated more than 6cm to be diagnosed. Additionally, if long-standing you would be able to note faecal loading and loss of normal radiological anatomy of the rest of the bowel. In this case, the patient has no risk factors for it and no radiological signs that would point towards this diagnosis.",

A similar problem may also occur at the caecum (20% of cases). In most people (around 80%) the caecum is a retroperitoneal structure so not at risk of twisting. In the remaining minority there is however developmental failure of peritoneal fixation of the proximal bowel putting these patients at risk of caecal volvulus.<br /><br /><div class=\"table-responsive\"><table class = \"tlarge table table-striped table-bordered\"  data-role=\"table\" id=\"tableid1\" ><thead><tr><th>Sigmoid volvulus associations</th><th>Caecal volvulus associations</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td><ul><li>older patients </li><li>chronic constipation</li><li>Chagas disease</li><li>neurological conditions e.g. Parkinson's disease,  Duchenne muscular dystrophy</li><li>psychiatric conditions e.g. schizophrenia</td><td></li><li>all ages</li><li>adhesions</li><li>pregnancy</td></tr></tbody></table></div></li></ul><br />Features<br /><ul><li>constipation</li><li>abdominal bloating</li><li>abdominal pain</li><li>nausea/vomiting</li></ul><br />Investigation<br /><ul><li>usually diagnosed on the abdominal film</li><li>sigmoid volvulus: large bowel obstruction (large, dilated loop of colon, often with air-fluid levels) + coffee bean sign</li><li>caecal volvulus: small bowel obstruction may be seen</li></ul><br /><div class=\"container\"><div class=\"row\"><div class=\"col-md-3\"><a href=\"https://d32xxyeh8kfs8k.cloudfront.net/images_Passmedicine/xrb941b.jpg\" data-fancybox=\"gallery\" data-caption=\"Sigmoid volvulus in an elderly male.
