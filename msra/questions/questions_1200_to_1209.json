The underlying pathophysiology is not fully understood.<br /><br /><h5 class='notes-heading'>Asbestosis</h5><br />The severity of asbestosis is related to the length of exposure. This is in contrast to mesothelioma where even very limited exposure can cause disease. The latent period is typically 15-30 years. Asbestosis typically causes lower lobe fibrosis. <br /><br />Features<br /><ul><li>dyspnoea and reduced exercise tolerance</li><li>clubbing</li><li>bilateral end-inspiratory crackles</li><li>lung function tests show a restrictive pattern with reduced gas transfer</li></ul><br />It is <span class=\"concept\" data-cid=\"11477\">treated conservatively</span> - no interventions offer a significant benefit. <br /><br /><h5 class='notes-heading'>Mesothelioma</h5><br />Mesothelioma is a malignant disease of the pleura.

            "<b>Lorazepam</b> is the correct answer. The patient is presenting with features of delirium tremens (DTs), a medical emergency characterised by confusion, agitation, tremor, and autonomic hyperactivity, typically occurring 48-72 hours after alcohol cessation. The first-line treatment for alcohol withdrawal, including DTs, is a benzodiazepine. However, this patient has known alcohol-related cirrhosis, which significantly alters the choice of agent. Chlordiazepoxide and diazepam are long-acting benzodiazepines that undergo hepatic oxidation via the cytochrome P450 system for their metabolism. This pathway is significantly impaired in patients with cirrhosis, leading to a prolonged half-life, drug accumulation, and an increased risk of over-sedation and precipitating or worsening hepatic encephalopathy. Lorazepam, in contrast, is an intermediate-acting benzodiazepine that is metabolised primarily through glucuronidation. This metabolic pathway is relatively preserved even in advanced liver disease. Therefore, lorazepam is the preferred benzodiazepine for managing alcohol withdrawal in patients with significant hepatic impairment, as it provides effective symptom control with a lower risk of adverse effects.<br /><br /><b>Chlordiazepoxide</b> is a long-acting benzodiazepine and is recommended by NICE as a first-line agent for managing uncomplicated alcohol withdrawal. It is typically administered as part of a fixed-dose or symptom-triggered reducing regimen. However, its use is relatively contraindicated in patients with severe liver impairment, such as the man in this scenario with alcohol-related cirrhosis. Its reliance on oxidative metabolism in the liver means it can accumulate to toxic levels, leading to prolonged sedation and potentially worsening the patient's confusion by contributing to hepatic encephalopathy. While it is a standard treatment, the presence of cirrhosis makes it a less safe and therefore less appropriate choice than lorazepam.<br /><br /><b>Haloperidol</b> is an antipsychotic medication that can be used to manage severe agitation or psychotic symptoms (like hallucinations) in delirium. However, it is not a first-line treatment for the underlying pathophysiology of alcohol withdrawal. Using it as monotherapy would fail to address the GABA/glutamate imbalance and would not prevent seizures or other complications. Furthermore, haloperidol can lower the seizure threshold, which is particularly dangerous in a patient already at high risk of withdrawal seizures. It also carries risks of extrapyramidal side effects and QT interval prolongation. It should only be considered as a small-dose adjunct to benzodiazepines in cases of severe, refractory agitation or psychosis.<br /><br /><b>Carbamazepine</b> is an anticonvulsant that has been shown to be effective in treating mild to moderate alcohol withdrawal symptoms and can be considered a second-line option. However, for severe withdrawal, as evidenced by the delirium tremens in this scenario, benzodiazepines are considered the gold standard and are more effective at preventing seizures and managing severe agitation. Additionally, carbamazepine is also metabolised in the liver and can cause hepatotoxicity, making it a less ideal choice in a patient with pre-existing cirrhosis. Its use would not be the most appropriate immediate step in a patient with DTs.<br /><br /><b>Phenytoin</b> is an anti-epileptic drug used for the management of focal and generalised tonic-clonic seizures. While seizures are a known and feared complication of alcohol withdrawal, phenytoin has been shown to be ineffective in their prevention or treatment in this specific context. Alcohol withdrawal seizures are caused by acute CNS hyperexcitability due to neurotransmitter imbalance, not by an underlying epileptic focus. The treatment of choice for preventing and managing alcohol withdrawal seizures is benzodiazepines, which directly target the underlying GABAergic deficit. Therefore, prescribing phenytoin would be inappropriate.",

            "Buerger's disease, or thromboangiitis obliterans, is a condition characterised by progressive inflammation and thrombosis of the small and medium arteries in the hands and feet. It can present as acute ischaemia or chronic progressive ischaemic changes to the skin/tissues. Ultimately it may result in gangrene of the affected area, often needing amputation. It is strongly associated with an extensive smoking history. The exact pathophysiology is not fully understood. <br /><br />Osteoarthritis presents with pain and swelling in the affected joint. Areas commonly affected include the wrist, knee, hip and thumb base. It is increasingly common with age and often presents as joint pain which is relieved by rest, worsening on use. <br /><br />Whilst radial artery dissection may present with acute ischaemia, it is unlikely in the scenario given the absence of traumatic injury in the history. <br /><br />Raynaud's phenomenon is characterised by transient vasospasm of the digits. It is most commonly triggered by cold and treatment is usually conservative, i.e. wear gloves/keep hands warm where possible. Sometimes calcium channel blockers are used in severe cases. The affected fingers classically change from white (hypoperfusion) to blue to red (reperfusion). It is mostly idiopathic but is sometimes associated with underlying connective tissue disease. <br /><br />Superficial vein thrombosis presents with a painful, inflamed area of skin in which the thrombosed or hardened vein is usually palpable. It is important to exclude underlying deep vein thrombosis in these cases.",

        "question": "A 54-year-old female presents with an acutely painful hand. She has a history of hypertension, Raynaud's phenomenon, and has smoked twenty cigarettes a day since she was twenty-two years old. She describes the pain as 'different from her usual Raynaud's,' there has been no relief of symptoms despite wearing gloves and making sure her hands are warm.  On examination she has a blood pressure of 158/80 mmHg, her right hand is blanched white and feels cold. The colour of her forearm is normal. The radial pulse is not palpable at the wrist. <br /><br />Which of the following conditions is the most likely explanation for her symptoms?",
