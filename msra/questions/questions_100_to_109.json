            "The correct answer is '<b>Patients who complain of pruritus 4 weeks following treatment should be retreated</b>'. This statement is false because itching can persist for up to 6 weeks after successful treatment due to a delayed hypersensitivity reaction to the mites, even if all the mites have been killed. Retreatment should only be considered if new burrows or rashes appear, or if living mites are found upon examination.<br /><br />Now let's move on to the other options:<br /><br />'<b>All members of the household should be treated</b>' - this statement is true. Scabies is highly contagious and can easily spread among people living in close quarters. Therefore, it's recommended that all members of a household, as well as any recent sexual partners, be treated at the same time to prevent re-infestation.<br /><br />'<b>Typically affects the fingers, interdigital webs and flexor aspects of the wrist in adults</b>' - this statement is also true. The <i>Sarcoptes scabiei</i> mite prefers warmer areas of the body such as these mentioned locations where they burrow into the skin and lay eggs.<br /><br />'<b>Scabies causes a delayed type IV hypersensitivity reaction</b>' - this statement is true as well. The intense itching associated with scabies isn't caused by the mites themselves but by an allergic reaction (type IV hypersensitivity) to their bodies, eggs and faeces.<br /><br />Finally, '<b>Malathion is suitable for the eradication of scabies</b>' - this statement is true too. Malathion 0.5% lotion (also known as Derbac-M) is indeed one of several treatments licensed in UK for use against scabies. It's particularly useful when first-line treatments cannot be used or have failed.",

            "Whilst uterine fibroids may be asymptomatic, symptoms can include menorrhagia (as seen in the history of this patient), symptoms due to their size (such as bloating and dysuria) and sub-fertility. In patients with sub-fertility in whom the only abnormal finding is a fibroid (or more than one fibroid) distorting the uterine cavity, treatment of the fibroid can promote fertility and also improve pregnancy outcomes. The medical therapies used to treat fibroids (such as anti-progestogens and gonadotrophin-releasing hormone agonists) often only temporarily reduce the size of fibroids. Furthermore, they interfere with fertility. Surgical treatment is therefore required in this case. The only surgical treatment of fibroids that preserves fertility is <b>myomectomy</b>, which is associated with improved fertility.  <br /><br />Whilst <b>the combined oral contraceptive pill</b> may be used to reduce the bleeding associated with fibroids, there is no good evidence that it alters the size of fibroids, and hence it would not help in this case, where a patient has sub-fertility due to a fibroid distorting her uterine cavity. Furthermore, the patient would be unable to conceive whilst on this trial of treatment.<br /><br /><b>Endometrial ablation</b> is a treatment that destroys the lining of the endometrium. It does not shrink the size of the fibroid but does significantly reduce menstrual bleeding. It is not appropriate for this patient as this patient desires fertility. Pregnancy is often not possible after treatment and, if the patient does become pregnant, ectopic pregnancies are more likely. <br /><br /><b>Uterine artery embolisation</b> is another procedure that is only used in patients with fibroids who do not desire fertility. It involves stopping the blood supply to the fibroid so that it degenerates. Whilst pregnancy may still be possible after uterine artery embolisation, it is not recommended due to increased obstetric risks such as placental abnormalities.<br /><br /><b>Repeat ultrasound in three months to monitor for spontaneous regression</b> is inappropriate. Whilst conservative management may be used for fibroids that are not causing symptoms, it is not appropriate for a fibroid that is distorting the uterine cavity, potentially causing sub-fertility.

            "<b>Pelvic floor muscle training</b> is the most appropriate first-line management for this patient with stress urinary incontinence. The clinical scenario describes classic stress incontinence symptoms - leakage with increased intra-abdominal pressure (coughing, laughing, exercising) without urgency or frequency. The examination findings of weak pelvic floor contraction and anterior wall prolapse are consistent with this diagnosis. According to NICE guidelines, supervised pelvic floor muscle training for at least 3 months (minimum 8 contractions performed 3 times daily) should be offered as first-line treatment for women with stress urinary incontinence. This non-invasive approach has good evidence for effectiveness in strengthening the pelvic floor muscles, which support the bladder and urethra, thereby reducing stress incontinence episodes. Risk factors in this patient include multiple vaginal deliveries and post-menopausal status, which can weaken pelvic floor muscles.<br /><br /><b>Duloxetine</b> is a serotonin-noradrenaline reuptake inhibitor that can be used in stress urinary incontinence by enhancing urethral sphincter contraction. However, it is not recommended as first-line therapy. NICE guidelines suggest duloxetine may be offered to women who decline surgical intervention or as a second-line option when conservative measures have failed. It is associated with significant side effects including nausea, dry mouth, and fatigue, making it less suitable as an initial treatment approach.<br /><br /><b>Mirabegron</b> is a beta-3 adrenergic receptor agonist used to treat overactive bladder syndrome and urge incontinence. It works by relaxing the detrusor muscle during bladder filling, increasing bladder capacity. This patient has no symptoms of urge incontinence (no urgency, frequency or nocturia), making mirabegron inappropriate. Mirabegron is particularly useful in elderly patients with overactive bladder where anticholinergic side effects are concerning.<br /><br /><b>Oxybutynin</b> is an antimuscarinic medication used for overactive bladder and urge incontinence. It reduces involuntary detrusor contractions by blocking muscarinic receptors. This patient's presentation is consistent with stress incontinence rather than urge incontinence, making oxybutynin inappropriate and potentially harmful as it could cause side effects such as dry mouth, constipation, and cognitive impairment without addressing her actual condition.<br /><br /><b>Tension-free vaginal tape procedure</b> is a surgical intervention for stress urinary incontinence that involves placing a synthetic mesh tape under the mid-urethra to provide support. While effective, surgery is not recommended as first-line management. NICE guidelines recommend considering surgical options only after conservative measures have been tried and failed, and after a comprehensive discussion of risks and benefits. Potential complications include mesh erosion, pain, infection, and voiding difficulties. Conservative management should always be attempted before considering invasive procedures.",

            "<b>Ofloxacin orally for 14 days</b> is the correct answer. This patient presents with epididymo-orchitis in the context of a low STI risk profile - he is in his 50s, married, and monogamous. In such cases, the most likely causative organisms are enteric bacteria, particularly <i>E. coli</i>, which spread from the urinary tract. UK guidelines recommend empirical treatment with an oral quinolone (such as ofloxacin or ciprofloxacin) for 2 weeks whilst awaiting urine culture results. The presence of the cremasteric reflex and the gradual onset over 3 days makes testicular torsion unlikely. A mid-stream urine sample should be sent for microscopy and culture, but treatment should not be delayed. Quinolones provide excellent tissue penetration into the epididymis and cover the likely enteric pathogens in this demographic group.<br /><br /><b>Ceftriaxone intramuscularly and doxycycline orally</b> is the recommended treatment when sexually transmitted infections are the most likely cause of epididymo-orchitis. This combination is used in younger, sexually active adults where <i>Chlamydia trachomatis</i> and <i>Neisseria gonorrhoeae</i> are the predominant pathogens. Given this patient's age, stable relationship, and low STI risk profile, this regimen would be inappropriate. This treatment would typically be initiated following referral to a sexual health clinic or when STI testing suggests these organisms.<br /><br /><b>Doxycycline orally for 7 days</b> would provide inadequate coverage for this patient. Whilst doxycycline is effective against chlamydial infections, it has poor activity against enteric organisms like <i>E. coli</i>, which are the likely pathogens in older men with low STI risk. Additionally, the duration of 7 days is insufficient for epididymo-orchitis, which requires at least 10-14 days of treatment to adequately penetrate the epididymal tissue and prevent chronic infection or abscess formation.<br /><br /><b>Co-amoxiclav orally for 7 days</b> is not the first-line treatment for epididymo-orchitis caused by enteric organisms. Whilst co-amoxiclav has activity against <i>E. coli</i>, quinolones are preferred due to their superior tissue penetration into the epididymis and their broader coverage of urinary pathogens. Additionally, the 7-day duration is too short for adequate treatment of epididymo-orchitis, which requires 14 days of therapy.<br /><br /><b>Trimethoprim orally for 7 days</b> is inadequate for treating epididymo-orchitis. Although trimethoprim is commonly used for uncomplicated urinary tract infections, it has poor tissue penetration into the epididymis and would not achieve adequate concentrations to treat this infection effectively. Furthermore, the 7-day course is insufficient - epididymo-orchitis requires 14 days of treatment.

Coarctation of the aorta is a type of congenital heart disease where there is a narrowing of the aorta, the large blood vessel that branches off your heart and delivers oxygen-rich blood to your body. This condition leads to acyanotic congenital heart disease, in which there is no blue or purple coloration due to deoxygenated blood bypassing the lungs and entering systemic circulation.<br /><br />Let's now discuss why other options are incorrect.<br /><br /><b>Tetralogy of Fallot</b> is incorrect because it typically presents as cyanotic congenital heart disease. It consists of four defects: ventricular septal defect (VSD), pulmonary stenosis, right ventricular hypertrophy, and an overriding aorta. These defects often lead to decreased pulmonary blood flow and right-to-left shunting of blood, causing cyanosis.<br /><br /><b>Pulmonary valve stenosis</b> can be part of Tetralogy of Fallot which is a cyanotic condition as mentioned above. Isolated pulmonary valve stenosis can potentially lead to acyanotic presentation but it usually causes right ventricular outflow tract obstruction leading to right ventricular hypertrophy and post-stenotic dilatation which may present with cyanosis in severe cases.<br /><br /><b>Transposition of the great arteries</b> is also incorrect as this condition typically results in cyanotic congenital heart disease. In this condition, the positions of the pulmonary artery and the aorta are switched, meaning that oxygenated and deoxygenated blood are not properly circulated throughout the body leading to cyanosis soon after birth.<br /><br />Finally, <b>Tricuspid atresia</b> is another example of cyanotic congenital heart disease where there's absence or underdevelopment of tricuspid valve leading to hypoplastic or absent right ventricle. This forces deoxygenated systemic venous blood from right atrium to left atrium through an atrial septal defect causing mixing with oxygenated pulmonary venous return leading to systemic desaturation i.e., cyanosis.<br />",
