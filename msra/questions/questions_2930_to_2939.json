        "body": "NICE updated their guidelines on the management of venous thromboembolism (VTE) in 2020. Some of the key changes include recommending the following:<br /><ul><li>the use of direct oral anticoagulants (DOACs) as first-line treatment for most people with VTE</li><li>the use of DOACs in patients with active cancer, as opposed to low-molecular weight heparin as was the previous recommendation</li><li>outpatient treatment in low-risk pulmonary embolism (PE) patients</li><li>routine cancer screening is no longer recommended following a VTE diagnosis</li></ul><br /><br /><h5 class='notes-heading'>Outpatient treatment in low-risk PE patients</h5><br />Deep vein thrombosis has for a long time been treated on an outpatient condition. In contrast, patients with any form of PE were typically admitted. However, in recent years patients with a new diagnosis of PE who are deemed low-risk are now increasingly managed as outpatients. NICE formally supported this approach in their latest guidance.<br /><ul><li>NICE recommends using a 'validated risk stratification tool' to determine the suitability of outpatient treatment.<ul><li>no guidance is given as to what tool should be used</li><li>the 2018 British Society guidelines support the use of the <span class=\"concept\" data-cid=\"10423\">Pulmonary Embolism Severity Index (PESI) score</span></li></ul></li><li>key requirements would clearly be haemodynamic stability, lack of comorbidities and support at home</li></ul><br /><br /><h5 class='notes-heading'>Anticogulant therapy</h5><br />The cornerstone of VTE management is anticoagulant therapy. This was historically done with warfarin, often preceded by heparin until the INR was stable. However, the development of DOACs, and an evidence base supporting their efficacy, has changed modern management.<br /><br />Choice of anticoagulant<br /><ul><li>the big change in the 2020 guidelines was the increased use of DOACs</li><li>apixaban or rivaroxaban (both DOACs) should be offered first-line following the diagnosis of a PE<ul><li>instead of using low-molecular weight heparin (LMWH) until the diagnosis is confirmed, NICE now advocate using a <span class=\"concept\" data-cid=\"8024\">DOAC once a diagnosis is suspected</span>, with this continued if the diagnosis is confirmed</li><li>if neither apixaban or rivaroxaban are suitable then either LMWH followed by dabigatran or edoxaban OR LMWH followed by a vitamin K antagonist (VKA, i.e. warfarin)</li></ul></li><li>if the patient has active cancer<ul><li>previously LMWH was recommended</li><li>the new guidelines now recommend using a DOAC, unless this is contraindicated</li></ul></li><li>if renal impairment is severe (e.g. < 15/min) then LMWH, unfractionated heparin or LMWH followed by a VKA</li><li>if the patient has antiphospholipid syndrome (specifically 'triple positive' in the guidance) then LMWH followed by a VKA should be used</li></ul><br />Length of anticoagulation<br /><ul><li>all patients should have anticoagulation for at least 3 months</li><li>continuing anticoagulation after this period is partly determined by whether the VTE was provoked or unprovoked<ul><li>a provoked VTE is due to an obvious precipitating event e.g. immobilisation following major surgery. The implication is that this event was transient and the patient is no longer at increased risk</li><li>an unprovoked VTE occurs in the absence of an obvious precipitating event, i.e. there is a possibility that there are unknown factors (e.g. mild thrombophilia) making the patient more at risk from further clots</li></ul></li><li><span class=\"concept\" data-cid=\"8025\">if the  VTE was provoked the treatment is typically stopped after the initial 3 months</span> (3 to 6 months for people with active cancer)</li><li><span class=\"concept\" data-cid=\"8026\">if the VTE was unprovoked then treatment is typically continued for up to 3 further months (i.e. 6 months in total)</span><ul><li>NICE recommend that whether a patient has a total of 3-6 months anticoagulant is based upon balancing  a person's risk of VTE recurrence and their risk of bleeding</li><li>the ORBIT score can be used to help assess the risk of bleeding</li><li>NICE state: '<i>Explain to people with unprovoked DVT or PE and a low bleeding risk that the benefits of continuing anticoagulation treatment are likely to outweigh the risks. </i>'.

        "body": "A scaphoid fracture is a type of wrist fracture, typically arises as a result of a fall onto an outstretched hand (FOOSH). This results in axial compression of the scaphoid, with the wrist hyperextended, and radially deviated. This can also occur during contact sports such as football, or during a road traffic accident due to the patient holding the steering wheel. It is important to examine for scaphoid fractures in anyone presenting with an acutely painful wrist for medico-legal reasons.<br /><br />Recognising scaphoid fractures is particularly important given the unusual blood supply of the scaphoid bone. Around 80% of the blood supply is derived from the <span class=\"concept\" data-cid=\"5352\">dorsal carpal branch (branch of the radial artery)</span>, in a retrograde manner. Interruption of the blood supply risks <b>avascular necrosis of the scaphoid</b>, with this most commonly complicating proximal injuries.   <br /><br /> Causes <br /><ul><li><span class=\"concept\" data-cid=\"11163\">Falling onto an outstretched hand (FOOSH)</span></li><li>Contact sports: The peak incidence during the autumn is thought to correlate with the start of football and rugby activities at school.</li></ul><br />Patients typically present with:<br /><ul><li>Pain along the radial aspect of the wrist, at the base of the thumb</li><li>Loss of grip / pinch strength</li></ul><br />Signs:<br /><ul><li>1.

Transmission occurs directly by close personal contact, or indirectly via fomites (contaminated surfaces) such as shared towels and flannels. The majority of cases occur in children (often in children with atopic eczema), with the maximum incidence in preschool children aged 1-4 years.<br /><br />Typically, molluscum contagiosum presents with characteristic pinkish or pearly white papules with a central umbilication, which are up to 5 mm in diameter. Lesions appear in clusters in areas anywhere on the body (except the palms of the hands and the soles of the feet). In children, lesions are commonly seen on the trunk and in flexures, but anogenital lesions may also occur. In adults, sexual contact may lead to lesions developing on the genitalia, pubis, thighs, and lower abdomen. Rarely, lesions can occur on the oral mucosa and on the eyelids.<br /><br /><div class=\"container\"><div class=\"row\"><div class=\"col-md-3\"><a href=\"https://d32xxyeh8kfs8k.cloudfront.net/images_Passmedicine/dsd121b.jpg\" data-fancybox=\"gallery\" data-caption=\"Molluscum contagiosum .

The patient presents with symptoms that are suggestive of hypothyroidism (fatigue, constipation) and has a mildly elevated TSH level with normal T4 levels on two separate occasions three months apart. Since the TSH is between 5.5 - 10mU/L and the patient is under 65 years old with symptoms of hypothyroidism, according to NICE guidelines, it would be reasonable to consider offering a trial of levothyroxine.<br /><br /><b>Prescribe iodine supplements</b> is incorrect. In this patient's case (with elevated TSH and normal free T4), iodine deficiency is unlikely to be the cause, and therefore supplementation would not address the underlying issue of subclinical hypothyroidism.
