            "The correct answer is acute closed-angle glaucoma. Acute closed-angle glaucoma describes a rise in intra-ocular pressure, secondary to impairment of aqueous outflow. This classically presents with an acutely painful red eye, associated with reduced visual acuity and haloes around light. Risk factors include hypermetropia, pupillary dilatation and age-associated lens growth. Common examination findings include a fixed dilated pupil with conjunctival injection (enlargement of conjunctival vessels). Management options include reducing aqueous secretions with acetazolamide (carbonic anhydrase inhibitor) and increasing pupillary constriction with topical pilocarpine. <br /><br />Anterior uveitis is incorrect. This describes inflammation of the anterior portion of the uvea (includes iris and ciliary body). It is associated with systemic inflammatory conditions (e.g. ankylosing spondylitis, psoriatic arthritis). A key ophthalmoscopy finding is an irregular pupil. <br /><br />Central retinal vein occlusion is incorrect. This is a cause of acute blindness and occurs due to the presence of either thromboembolism or vasculitis in the central retinal vein. Severe retinal haemorrhages are seen on ophthalmoscopy. <br /><br />Infective conjunctivitis is incorrect. This is characterised by sore, red eyes with associated discharge. In bacterial causes, discharge is purulent and in viral cases, this is often serous in nature.<br /><br />Vitreous haemorrhage is incorrect. This describes bleeding into the vitreous humour and is a common cause of sudden, painless loss of vision. Causes include proliferative diabetic retinopathy, bleeding disorders and ocular trauma.",

This precipitates damage to endothelial cells and pericytes<br /><br />Endothelial dysfunction leads to increased vascular permeability which causes the characteristic exudates seen on fundoscopy. Pericyte dysfunction predisposes to the formation of microaneurysms. Neovasculization is thought to be caused by the production of growth factors in response to retinal ischaemia<br /><br /><br /><h5 class='notes-heading'>Classification</h5><br />Patients are typically classified into those with non-proliferative diabetic retinopathy (NPDR), proliferative retinopathy (PDR) and maculopathy.<br /><br /><h6 class='notes-subheading'>Non-proliferative diabetic retinopathy</h6><br />Mild NPDR<br /><ul><li>1 or more microaneurysm</li></ul><br />Moderate NPDR<br /><ul><li>microaneurysms</li><li>blot haemorrhages </li><li>hard exudates</li><li>cotton wool spots  ('soft exudates' -  <span class=\"concept\" data-cid=\"11238\">represent areas of retinal infarction</span>), venous beading/looping and intraretinal microvascular abnormalities (IRMA) less severe than in severe NPDR</li></ul><br />Severe NPDR<br /><ul><li>blot haemorrhages and microaneurysms in 4 quadrants</li><li>venous beading in at least 2 quadrants</li><li>IRMA in at least 1 quadrant</li></ul><br /><div class=\"container\"><div class=\"row\"><div class=\"col-md-3\"><a href=\"https://d32xxyeh8kfs8k.cloudfront.net/images_Passmedicine/pdd576b.jpg\" data-fancybox=\"gallery\" data-caption=\"Pre-proliferative diabetic retinopathy\"><img  class=\"img-thumbnail mx-auto d-block\" style=\"max-height:150px;margin-bottom:10px;\" src=\"https://d32xxyeh8kfs8k.cloudfront.net/images_Passmedicine/pdd576.jpg\" alt=\"\" /></a></div></div></div><br /><h6 class='notes-subheading'>Proliferative diabetic retinopathy</h6><br />Key features<br /><ul><li>retinal neovascularisation - may lead to vitrous haemorrhage</li><li>fibrous tissue forming anterior to retinal disc</li><li>more common in Type I DM, 50% blind in 5 years</li></ul><br /><div class=\"container\"><div class=\"row\"><div class=\"col-md-3\"><a href=\"https://d32xxyeh8kfs8k.cloudfront.net/images_Passmedicine/img055b.jpg\" data-fancybox=\"gallery\" data-caption=\"Proliferative diabetic retinopathy\"><img  class=\"img-thumbnail mx-auto d-block\" style=\"max-height:150px;margin-bottom:10px;\" src=\"https://d32xxyeh8kfs8k.cloudfront.net/images_Passmedicine/img055.jpg\" alt=\"\" /></a></div></div></div><br /><h6 class='notes-subheading'>Maculopathy</h6><br />Key features<br /><ul><li>based on location rather than severity, anything is potentially serious</li><li>hard exudates and other 'background' changes on macula</li><li>check visual acuity</li><li>more common in Type II DM</li></ul><br /><h5 class='notes-heading'>Management</h5><br />All patients<br /><ul><li>optimise glycaemic control, blood pressure and hyperlipidemia</li><li>regular review by ophthalmology</li></ul><br />Maculopathy<br /><ul><li>if there is a change in visual acuity then intravitreal vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) inhibitors </li></ul><br />Non-proliferative retinopathy<br /><ul><li>regular observation</li><li>if severe/very severe consider panretinal laser photocoagulation</li></ul><br />Proliferative retinopathy<br /><ul><li><span class=\"concept\" data-cid=\"11714\">panretinal laser photocoagulation</span><ul><li>following treatment around 50% of patients develop a <span class=\"concept\" data-cid=\"12018\">noticeable reduction in their visual fields</span> due to the scarring of peripheral retinal tissue</li><li>other complications include a <span class=\"concept\" data-cid=\"12109\">decrease in night vision</span> (rods are predominantly responsible for vision in low light conditions, the majority of rod cells are located in the peripheral retina), a generalised decrease in visual acuity and macular oedema</li></ul></li><li><span class=\"concept\" data-cid=\"11787\">intravitreal VEGF inhibitors</span><ul><li>often now used in combination with panretinal laser photocoagulation</li><li>examples include ranibizumab</li><li>strong evidence base suggests they both slow progression of proliferative diabetic retinopathy and improve visual acuity</li></ul></li><li>if severe or vitreous haemorrhage: vitreoretinal surgery</li></ul><br /><div class=\"container\"><div class=\"row\"><div class=\"col-md-3\"><a href=\"https://d32xxyeh8kfs8k.cloudfront.net/images_Passmedicine/img053b.jpg\" data-fancybox=\"gallery\" data-caption=\"Diabetic retinopathy previously treated with panretinal laser photocoagulation\"><img  class=\"img-thumbnail mx-auto d-block\" style=\"max-height:150px;margin-bottom:10px;\" src=\"https://d32xxyeh8kfs8k.cloudfront.net/images_Passmedicine/img053.jpg\" alt=\"\" /></a></div></div></div>",
