        "title": "Acute coronary syndrome: initial management",
        "body": "Acute coronary syndrome (ACS) is a very common and important presentation in medicine. The management of ACS has evolved over recent years, with the development of new drugs and procedures such as percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI).<br /><br />Emergency departments often have their own protocols based on local factors such as the availability of PCI and hospital drug formularies. The following is based on the 2020 update to the NICE ACS guidelines.<br /><br />Acute coronary syndrome can be classified as follows:<br /><ul><li>ST-elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI): ST-segment elevation + elevated biomarkers of myocardial damage</li><li>non ST-elevation myocardial infarction (NSTEMI): ECG changes but no ST-segment elevation + elevated biomarkers of myocardial damage</li><li>unstable angina</li></ul><br />The management of ACS depends on the particular subtype. NICE management guidance groups the patients into two groups:<br /><ul><li>1. STEMI</li><li>2. NSTEM/unstable angina</li></ul><br /><h5 class='notes-heading'>Common management of all patients with ACS</h5><br />Initial drug therapy<br /><ul><li><span class=\"concept\" data-cid=\"11121\">aspirin 300mg</span></li><li><span class=\"concept\" data-cid=\"11122\">oxygen should only be given if the patient has oxygen saturations < 94%</span> in keeping with British Thoracic Society oxygen therapy guidelines</li><li><span class=\"concept\" data-cid=\"11123\">morphine should only be given for patients with severe pain</span><ul><li>previously IV morphine was given routinely</li><li>evidence, however, suggests that this may be associated with adverse outcomes </li></ul></li><li>nitrates<ul><li>can be given either sublingually or intravenously</li><li>useful if the patient has ongoing chest pain or hypertension</li><li><span class=\"concept\" data-cid=\"11124\">should be used in caution if patient hypotensive</span></li></ul></li></ul><br />The next step in managing a patient with suspected ACS is to determine whether they meet the ECG criteria for STEMI.

            "The correct answer is <b>Dilated cardiomyopathy</b>. A third heart sound, or S3, is often associated with conditions that lead to rapid filling of the ventricles. This can happen in dilated cardiomyopathy, a condition characterised by dilation and impaired contraction of the left or both ventricles. The increased volume load leads to rapid early diastolic filling, causing an audible S3. In addition to this, the patient's age and symptoms of exertional dyspnoea are consistent with dilated cardiomyopathy.<br /><br />The option <b>Hypertrophic obstructive cardiomyopathy</b> is incorrect. While this condition can indeed cause shortness of breath due to obstruction of the outflow tract, it is typically not associated with an S3 heart sound. Instead, a fourth heart sound (S4) due to forceful atrial contraction against a stiffened ventricle may be heard.<br /><br /><b>Atrial fibrillation</b> is also an incorrect choice. Although atrial fibrillation can lead to symptoms such as shortness of breath and fatigue due to irregular and often rapid heart rate, it does not produce an S3 heart sound. Additionally, atrial fibrillation would likely present with an irregularly irregular pulse on examination.<br /><br /><b>Mitral stenosis</b> too is incorrect in this context. Mitral stenosis usually presents with a loud first heart sound (S1), an opening snap following the second heart sound (S2), and a mid-diastolic rumbling murmur heard best at the apex. An S3 heart sound is not typical for mitral stenosis.<br /><br />Finally, this presentation cannot be considered a <b>normal variant</b>. Although an S3 may be heard in young individuals or athletes due to increased blood return during diastole causing rapid ventricular filling (physiological third heart sound), in older adults like our 60-year-old patient it generally indicates pathological conditions such as dilated cardiomyopathy or congestive heart failure.",

            "The correct answer is <b>7 days</b>. According to the UK Faculty of Sexual and Reproductive Healthcare (FSRH) guidance, if a combined oral contraceptive pill (COCP) such as Microgynon 30 is started after the fifth day of the menstrual cycle, it will not provide reliable contraception until 7 days of consistent use. This is due to the fact that ovulation may have already occurred, and therefore additional contraceptive measures should be used for the first seven days.<br /><br />The option <b>Immediately</b> is incorrect because the COCP does not provide immediate contraceptive protection if started after day 5 of the menstrual cycle. The pill needs time to suppress ovulation and thicken cervical mucus to prevent sperm from reaching an egg.<br /><br />The option <b>2 days</b> is also incorrect. While some effects of COCPs, such as changes in cervical mucus, can occur within two days, it takes a full seven days for these pills to reliably prevent pregnancy if they are started after day 5 of the menstrual cycle.<br /><br />Similarly, <b>5 days</b> is not enough time for the COCP to become fully effective if it was initiated after day five of the menstrual cycle. Although some women may start ovulating again as soon as five days after stopping their birth control pill, this does not mean that starting a COCP on or after day five will provide reliable contraception within this timeframe.<br /><br />Finally, waiting until the <b>first day of next period</b> would actually result in an extended period without effective contraception. If a woman starts taking her COCP on day eight of her cycle and then waits until her next period before relying on it for contraception, she would be unprotected during her most fertile time'the week leading up to and including ovulation'which typically occurs mid-cycle.<br />",

        "question_notes": "<b>Observation and supportive care</b> is correct. This patient is presenting with signs and symptoms of transient tachypnoea of the newborn. Increased respiratory rate and the chest x-ray findings of hyperinflation and fluid in the horizontal fissure are key findings in transient tachypnoea of the newborn. This patient should be managed with supportive care and supplemental oxygen if required. Symptoms usually resolve spontaneously within a couple of days. <br /><br /><b>IV ceftriaxone</b> and <b>IV steroids</b> are incorrect. Antibiotics and steroids are not indicated in transient tachypnoea of the newborn as only supportive management and supplemental oxygen are required. Therefore, both of these options are incorrect. <br /><br /><b>Urgent blood transfusion</b> is incorrect. There is no indication for a blood transfusion in this patient as there is no sign of haemorrhage or hypotension. This patient has transient tachypnoea of the newborn, a condition that resolves with just supportive care and supplemental oxygen. <br /><br /><b>Urgent surgical referral</b> is incorrect. There is no need for surgical referral for patients with transient tachypnoea of the newborn. This condition will resolve spontaneously without the need for surgery.",
