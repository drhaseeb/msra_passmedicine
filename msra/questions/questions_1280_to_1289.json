            "<b> Meconium ileus </b> - this is the correct answer because the baby has presented with abdominal distention and bilious vomiting in the first couple days of life. She has also not passed any meconium. Meconium ileus is more common in children with cystic fibrosis but this child is too young to have had a heel prick test to diagnose cystic fibrosis yet since this is normally done at day 5.<br /><br /><b> Duodenal atresia </b> - duodenal atresia normally presents in the first few hours of life and often shows up on antenatal scans. This baby is now 2 days old and had normal antenatal scans making this answer less likely.<br /><br /><b> Necrotizing enterocolitis </b> - this is incorrect because necrotizing enterocolitis (NEC) is normally seen in preterm babies at a few weeks of life. This baby is born at term and is only 2 days old so NEC is unlikely.<br /><br /><b> Posseting </b> - posseting is the act of bringing up small quantities of milk without any pain or discomfort. This is normal and is not associated with any pathology. In this scenario, there is green/yellow vomit which is not seen in posseting so this is incorrect.<br /><br /><b> Pyloric stenosis </b> - pyloric stenosis usually presents at 2-12 weeks with projectile vomiting.

            "The correct answer is <b>sleep paralysis</b>. Sleep paralysis is a condition characterized by the inability to move or speak when transitioning between sleep and wakefulness, either when falling asleep or upon awakening. It can be accompanied by vivid hallucinations, which may explain the patient's description of seeing another person in the room. Sleep paralysis is generally harmless but can cause significant anxiety for those who experience it.<br /><br />The first incorrect option, <b>frontal lobe epilepsy</b>, is a type of focal epilepsy that originates in the frontal lobes of the brain. While seizures in frontal lobe epilepsy can occur during sleep and present with unusual behaviours or movements, they would not typically cause the sensation of paralysis described by the patient.<br /><br /><b>Generalised anxiety disorder</b> (GAD) is another incorrect option. GAD is characterized by excessive and persistent worry about various aspects of life, which might include concerns about one's health. However, GAD does not directly cause episodes of sleep-related paralysis or hallucinations.<br /><br />The fourth option, <b>night terrors</b>, are episodes of intense fear and agitation that occur during deep non-REM sleep. They are more common in children but can also affect adults. During a night terror episode, an individual may scream, thrash around, or exhibit other signs of distress; however, they do not experience paralysis as described by the patient.<br /><br />Finally, <b>acute schizophrenia</b> is an incorrect answer choice. Schizophrenia is a chronic mental health disorder characterized by symptoms such as hallucinations, delusions, disorganized speech and behaviour, and negative symptoms like diminished emotional expression. While hallucinations may be present in schizophrenia patients, the specific pattern of sleep-related paralysis described by this patient does not align with typical manifestations of acute schizophrenia.<br /><br />In conclusion, based on this 23-year-old man's presentation of transient paralysis upon waking up or falling asleep, accompanied by hallucinations and increasing anxiety, the most likely diagnosis is sleep paralysis.",

This scoring system superceded the CHADS<sub>2</sub> score.<br /><br /><div class=\"table-responsive\"><table class = \"tlarge table table-striped table-bordered\"  data-role=\"table\" id=\"tableid1\" ><thead><tr><th></th><th>Risk factor</th><th>Points</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td> <b>C</b></td><td>Congestive heart failure</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td> <b>H</b></td><td>Hypertension (or treated hypertension)</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td> <b>A<sub>2</sub></b></td><td>Age >= 75 years</td><td>2</td></tr><tr><td></td><td>Age 65-74 years</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td> <b>D</b></td><td>Diabetes</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td> <b>S<sub>2</sub></b></td><td>Prior Stroke, TIA or thromboembolism</td><td>2</td></tr><tr><td> <b>V</b></td><td>Vascular disease (including ischaemic heart disease and peripheral arterial disease)</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td><b>S</b></td><td>Sex (female)</td><td>1</td></tr></tbody></table></div><br />The table below shows a suggested <span class=\"concept\" data-cid=\"1686\">anticoagulation strategy based on the score</span>:<br /><br /><div class=\"table-responsive\"><table class = \"tlarge table table-striped table-bordered\"  data-role=\"table\" id=\"tableid2\" ><thead><tr><th>Score</th><th>Anticoagulation</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>0</td><td>No treatment</td></tr><tr><td>1</td><td>Males: Consider anticoagulation<br />Females: No treatment (this is because their score of 1 is only reached due to their gender)</td></tr><tr><td>2 or more</td><td>Offer anticoagulation</td></tr></tbody></table></div><br />Remember that if a CHA<sub>2</sub>DS<sub>2</sub>-VASc score suggests no need for anticoagulation it is important to ensure a <span class=\"concept\" data-cid=\"10904\">transthoracic echocardiogram has been done to exclude valvular heart disease</span>, which in combination with AF is an absolute indication for anticoagulation.<br /><br /><br /><h5 class='notes-heading'>Assessing bleeding risk</h5><br />Doctors have always thought carefully about the risk/benefit profile of starting someone on warfarin. A history of falls, old age, alcohol excess and a history of previous bleeding are common things that make us consider whether anticoagulation is in the best interests of the patient., but NICE warn us <span class=\"concept\" data-cid=\"5359\">not to withhold anticoagulation solely on the grounds of age or risk falls</span>. NICE now recommend we formalise this risk assessment using the <span class=\"concept\" data-cid=\"11422\">ORBIT scoring system</span>. Previously the HAS-BLED scoring system was recommended.<br /><br /><div class=\"table-responsive\"><table class = \"tlarge table table-striped table-bordered\"  data-role=\"table\" id=\"tableid3\" ><thead><tr><th>Variable</th><th>Points</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td><span class=\"concept\" data-cid=\"11423\">Haemoglobin</span> <130 g/L  for males and < 120 g/L for females, or haemtocrit < 40% for males and < 36% for females</td><td>2</td></tr><tr><td>Age > 74 years</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>Bleeding history (GI bleeding, intracranial bleeding or haemorrhagic stroke)</td><td>2</td></tr><tr><td><span class=\"concept\" data-cid=\"11423\">Renal impairment</span> (GFR < 60 mL/min/1.73m<sup>2</sup>)</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>Treatment with antiplatelet agents</td><td>1</td></tr></tbody></table></div><br />There are no formal rules on how we act on the ORBIT score and individual patient factors should be taken into account. However, the following table acts as a guide: <br /><br /><div class=\"table-responsive\"><table class = \"tlarge table table-striped table-bordered\"  data-role=\"table\" id=\"tableid4\" ><thead><tr><th>ORBIT score</th><th>Risk group</th><th>Bleeds per 100 patient-years</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>0-2</td><td>Low</td><td>2.4</td></tr><tr><td>3</td><td>Medium</td><td>4.7</td></tr><tr><td>4-7</td><td>High</td><td>8.1</td></tr></tbody></table></div><br /><br /><h5 class='notes-heading'>If treatment is indicated, which anticoagulant?</h5><br />For many years warfarin was the anticoagulant of choice in atrial fibrillation. This changed following the development of <span class=\"concept\" data-cid=\"3635\"><b>direct oral anticoagulants (DOACs)</b></span>. These have the advantage of not requiring regular blood tests to check the INR and now recommended as the first-line anticoagulant for patients with AF. If a patient was previously started on warfarin, NICE recommend discussing switching to a DOAC during a routine follow-up appointment.<br /><br />The following DOACs are recommended by NICE for reducing stroke risk in AF:<br /><ul><li>apixaban</li><li>dabigatran</li><li>edoxaban</li><li>rivaroxaban</li></ul><br />Warfarin is now used second-line, in patients where a DOAC is contraindicated or not tolerated.<br /><br />Aspirin is not recommended for reducing stroke risk in patients with AF.",
