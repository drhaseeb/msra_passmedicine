The pain has been present for the past 48 hours and worse at night. He states the pain is in the outer side of his calf and the top of his foot and toes. He has a past medical history of osteoarthritis, gout and hypertension. His regular medications are paracetamol, amlodipine, naproxen, allopurinol and omeprazole.<br /><br />On examination he has no ankle or foot tenderness or joint deformity. He has limited movement of the ankle and it is painful to dorsiflex his foot. He has slightly altered sensation over the dorsum of his foot but sensation in the rest of his leg is normal.

            "<b>Inotropic support on the high dependency unit (HDU)</b> is the correct answer. In acute pulmonary oedema, the primary aim of management is diuresis to offload excess fluid. In patients who have cardiogenic shock, diuresis would lower blood pressure further and worsen the picture of shock. Inotropes should therefore be considered in this patient group to promote increased cardiac contractility and support blood pressure whilst diuresis is ongoing. <br /><br /><b>Biphasic positive airway pressure</b> (BiPAP) is used as a method of non-invasive ventilation for patients who are hypoxic and hypercapnic. BiPAP is used primarily to aid in carbon dioxide elimination where retention has led to adverse physiological consequences such as acidosis. Pulmonary oedema does not typically lead to hypercapnia therefore BiPAP would not be an immediate consideration for this patient.<br /><br /><b>Giving IV fluid for her hypotension</b> would not be appropriate. In this scenario, her hypotension is secondary to cardiogenic shock, not hypovolaemic shock. Giving further fluid in this scenario would worsen the condition of the patient by contributing to the fluid overload.<br /><br /><b>Bisoprolol</b> is contraindicated in this scenario. In acute heart failure, there is a compensatory tachycardia to maintain cardiac output. Giving bisoprolol would suppress this mechanism and worsen the cardiogenic shock. Outside of an acute scenario, a patient can continue on their routine bisoprolol if they are already prescribed this for heart failure unless they are bradycardic.<br /><br /><b>Start a rate-limiting calcium channel blocker</b> is also inappropriate for the same reasons as starting bisoprolol.",

            "<b>Arrange a lipid profile then calculate his QRISK2 score</b> is the most appropriate next step for this 49-year-old man concerned about his coronary heart disease risk. According to NICE guidelines on cardiovascular disease risk assessment, a systematic strategy should be used to identify people aged over 40 years who may be at high risk of cardiovascular disease. The QRISK2 tool is recommended for patients up to 84 years of age to calculate their 10-year risk of developing cardiovascular disease.

        "body": "In 2014 NICE updated their guidelines on lipid modification. This proved highly controversial as it meant that we should be recommending statins to a significant proportion of the population over the age of 60 years. Anyway, the key points of the new guidelines are summarised below.<br /><br /><CENTER><table><tr><td align = 'left' colspan='2'><a data-fancybox class='fancybox' rel='group' href='https://d32xxyeh8kfs8k.cloudfront.net/images_Passmedicine/pdd915b.png'><img class='ajaximage' src='https://d32xxyeh8kfs8k.cloudfront.net/images_Passmedicine/pdd915.png'/></a></td></tr><tr><td valign='top' align='left'></td><td align='right'><a data-fancybox class='fancybox lbmagglasslink' rel='group' href='https://d32xxyeh8kfs8k.cloudfront.net/images_Passmedicine/pdd915b.png'><img src='https://d32xxyeh8kfs8k.cloudfront.net/css/images/mag_glass.png'/></a></td></tr></table></CENTER><div class='imagetext'>Graphic showing choice of statin.</div><br /><h5 class='notes-heading'>Primary prevention - who and how to assess risk</h5><br />A systematic strategy should be used to identify people aged over 40 years who are likely to be at high risk of cardiovascular disease (CVD), defined as a 10-year risk of <b>10%</b> or greater. <br /><br />NICE recommend we use the <b>QRISK2</b> CVD risk assessment tool for patients aged <= 84 years. Patients >= 85 years are at high risk of CVD due to their age. QRISK2 should not be used in the following situations as there are more specific guidelines for these patient groups:<br /><ul><li>type 1 diabetics</li><li>patients with an estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) less than 60 ml/min and/or albuminuria</li><li>patients with a history of familial hyperlipidaemia</li></ul><br />NICE suggest QRISK2 may underestimate CVD risk in the following population groups:<br /><ul><li>people treated for HIV</li><li>people with serious mental health problems</li><li>people taking medicines that can cause dyslipidaemia such as antipsychotics, corticosteroids or immunosuppressant drugs</li><li>people with autoimmune disorders/systemic inflammatory disorders such as systemic lupus erythematosus</li></ul><br /><br /><h5 class='notes-heading'>Measuring lipid levels</h5><br />When measuring lipids both the total cholesterol and HDL should be checked to provide the most accurate risk of CVD. A full lipid profile should also be checked (i.e. including triglycerides) before starting a statin. The samples do not need to be fasting.<br /><br />In the vast majority of patients the cholesterol measurements will be fed into the QRISK2 tool. If however, the patient's cholesterol is very high we should consider familial hyperlipidaemia. NICE recommend the following that we should consider the possibility of familial hypercholesterolaemia and investigate further if:<br /><ul><li>the total cholesterol level greater than 7.5 mmol/L and/or</li><li>there is a personal or family history of premature coronary heart disease (an event before 60 years in an index person or first-degree relative [parents, siblings, children])</li></ul><br /><br /><h5 class='notes-heading'>Interpreting the QRISK2 result</h5><br />Probably the headline change in the 2014 guidelines was the new, lower cut-off of 10-year CVD risk cut-off of 10%. <br /><br /><h5 class='notes-heading'>NICE now recommend we offer a statin to people with a QRISK2 10-year risk of >= 10%</h5><br />Lifestyle factors are of course important and NICE recommend that we give patients the option of having their CVD risk reassessed after a period of time before starting a statin.<br /><br />Atorvastatin 20mg should be offered first-line.<br /><br /><br /><h5 class='notes-heading'>Special situations</h5><br />Type 1 diabetes mellitus<br /><ul><li>NICE recommend that we 'consider statin treatment for the primary prevention of CVD in all adults with type 1 diabetes'</li><li>atorvastatin 20 mg should be offered if type 1 diabetics who are:<ul><li>older than 40 years, or</li><li>have had diabetes for more than 10 years or</li><li>have established nephropathy or</li><li>have other CVD risk factors</li></ul></li></ul><br />Chronic kidney disease (CKD)<br /><ul><li>atorvastatin 20mg should be offered to patients with CKD</li><li>increase the dose if a greater than 40% reduction in non-HDL cholesterol is not achieved and the eGFR > 30 ml/min.

            "A bulk-forming laxative such as isphagula husk is the first-line recommended pharmacological treatment for constipation in patients with IBS. It helps to retain fluid within the stool and increases faecal mass, therefore stimulating peristalsis. It also is known to have stool-softening properties.<br /><br />As per NICE guidelines, lactulose is not recommended to treat constipation in IBS as it can increase gas production, thereby making symptoms worse in some patients.<br /><br />Linaclotide is a newer drug that is licensed to treat constipation in IBS. It is a guanylate cyclase-C receptor agonist that stimulates intestinal fluid secretion and accelerates transit by increasing chloride concentration within the gastrointestinal lumen. However, it should only be considered if optimal doses of laxatives from different classes have been tried and found to be unsuccessful.",
            "From the options above, a proton pump inhibitor (PPI) would be the most effective pharmacological option to manage the dyspepsia symptoms secondary to antiplatelet therapy.<br /><br />Omeprazole and esomeprazole are known to decrease the efficacy of clopidogrel due to its inhibition of the CYP2C19 enzyme, which is needed to convert clopidogrel into its active metabolite. While the clinical consequences of this effect have not been conclusively demonstrated, both the British National Formulary (BNF) and Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA) discourage the concomitant use of these two drugs.<br /><br />Lansoprazole is not thought to exert this pharmacodynamic effect and hence this would be a preferred alternative.",
            "This patient has typical symptoms of migraine. A prokinetic such as metoclopramide is the recommended antiemetic in these patients, as it helps to relieve the gastric stasis that can slow the transit and absorption of drugs during an acute migraine attack. In fact, NICE guidance on migraine suggests that it should be considered even in the absence of nausea and vomiting, solely due to its prokinetic effects.<br /><br />While metoclopramide carries risks of extrapyramidal side-effects with long-term use, it is fairly low-risk given the short duration and relatively low frequency of attacks in this patient. Generally, patients should be advised that metoclopramide is taken for no longer than 5 days in a treatment course."
