            "<b>De Quervain's tenosynovitis</b> is the correct answer. De Quervain's tenosynovitis is an idiopathic pain syndrome involving the tendons of extensor pollicis brevis and abductor pollicis longus at the radial wrist. Finkelstein's test, which is performed by pulling the patient's thumb with ulnar deviation and longitudinal traction, can aid the diagnosis of De Quervain's tenosynovitis. Finkelstein's test is positive if the manoeuvre reproduces pain.<br /><br /><b>Carpal tunnel syndrome</b> is incorrect. Carpal tunnel syndrome is characterised by wrist/hand pain, classically sparing the medial fifth finger and the medial half of the fourth finger, caused by median nerve entrapment within the carpal tunnel. This patient's lateral wrist pain with tenderness over the lateral styloid are more consistent with De Quervain's tenosynovitis.<br /><br /><b>Cervical radiculopathy</b> is incorrect. Patients may develop radicular pain due to entrapment of cervical nerve roots, commonly due to cervical spondylosis and disc disease. This pain characteristically radiates from the neck down the arm, and would not typically present with isolated wrist pain.<br /><br /><b>Cubital tunnel syndrome</b> is incorrect. The ulnar nerve may become trapped within the cubital tunnel, closely associated with the medial epicondyle of the elbow, causing pain in the distribution of the ulnar nerve. Isolated pain at the radial styloid is not typical of cubital tunnel syndrome and should raise suspicion for De Quervain's tenosynovitis.<br /><br /><b>Occult scaphoid injury</b> is incorrect. Although scaphoid fractures may present with wrist pain over the anatomical snuffbox, closely associated with the radial styloid, this usually occurs following trauma, usually a fall onto an outstretched hand. Given the atraumatic presentation, De Quervain's tenosynovitis is a more likely diagnosis than scaphoid injury.",

        "body": "Diabetic retinopathy is the most common cause of blindness in adults aged 35-65 years-old. <br /><br /><h5 class='notes-heading'>Pathophysiology</h5><br />Hyperglycaemia is thought to cause increased retinal blood flow and abnormal metabolism in the retinal vessel walls. This precipitates damage to endothelial cells and pericytes<br /><br />Endothelial dysfunction leads to increased vascular permeability which causes the characteristic exudates seen on fundoscopy. Pericyte dysfunction predisposes to the formation of microaneurysms. Neovasculization is thought to be caused by the production of growth factors in response to retinal ischaemia<br /><br /><br /><h5 class='notes-heading'>Classification</h5><br />Patients are typically classified into those with non-proliferative diabetic retinopathy (NPDR), proliferative retinopathy (PDR) and maculopathy.<br /><br /><h6 class='notes-subheading'>Non-proliferative diabetic retinopathy</h6><br />Mild NPDR<br /><ul><li>1 or more microaneurysm</li></ul><br />Moderate NPDR<br /><ul><li>microaneurysms</li><li>blot haemorrhages </li><li>hard exudates</li><li>cotton wool spots  ('soft exudates' -  <span class=\"concept\" data-cid=\"11238\">represent areas of retinal infarction</span>), venous beading/looping and intraretinal microvascular abnormalities (IRMA) less severe than in severe NPDR</li></ul><br />Severe NPDR<br /><ul><li>blot haemorrhages and microaneurysms in 4 quadrants</li><li>venous beading in at least 2 quadrants</li><li>IRMA in at least 1 quadrant</li></ul><br /><div class=\"container\"><div class=\"row\"><div class=\"col-md-3\"><a href=\"https://d32xxyeh8kfs8k.cloudfront.net/images_Passmedicine/pdd576b.jpg\" data-fancybox=\"gallery\" data-caption=\"Pre-proliferative diabetic retinopathy\"><img  class=\"img-thumbnail mx-auto d-block\" style=\"max-height:150px;margin-bottom:10px;\" src=\"https://d32xxyeh8kfs8k.cloudfront.net/images_Passmedicine/pdd576.jpg\" alt=\"\" /></a></div></div></div><br /><h6 class='notes-subheading'>Proliferative diabetic retinopathy</h6><br />Key features<br /><ul><li>retinal neovascularisation - may lead to vitrous haemorrhage</li><li>fibrous tissue forming anterior to retinal disc</li><li>more common in Type I DM, 50% blind in 5 years</li></ul><br /><div class=\"container\"><div class=\"row\"><div class=\"col-md-3\"><a href=\"https://d32xxyeh8kfs8k.cloudfront.net/images_Passmedicine/img055b.jpg\" data-fancybox=\"gallery\" data-caption=\"Proliferative diabetic retinopathy\"><img  class=\"img-thumbnail mx-auto d-block\" style=\"max-height:150px;margin-bottom:10px;\" src=\"https://d32xxyeh8kfs8k.cloudfront.net/images_Passmedicine/img055.jpg\" alt=\"\" /></a></div></div></div><br /><h6 class='notes-subheading'>Maculopathy</h6><br />Key features<br /><ul><li>based on location rather than severity, anything is potentially serious</li><li>hard exudates and other 'background' changes on macula</li><li>check visual acuity</li><li>more common in Type II DM</li></ul><br /><h5 class='notes-heading'>Management</h5><br />All patients<br /><ul><li>optimise glycaemic control, blood pressure and hyperlipidemia</li><li>regular review by ophthalmology</li></ul><br />Maculopathy<br /><ul><li>if there is a change in visual acuity then intravitreal vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) inhibitors </li></ul><br />Non-proliferative retinopathy<br /><ul><li>regular observation</li><li>if severe/very severe consider panretinal laser photocoagulation</li></ul><br />Proliferative retinopathy<br /><ul><li><span class=\"concept\" data-cid=\"11714\">panretinal laser photocoagulation</span><ul><li>following treatment around 50% of patients develop a <span class=\"concept\" data-cid=\"12018\">noticeable reduction in their visual fields</span> due to the scarring of peripheral retinal tissue</li><li>other complications include a <span class=\"concept\" data-cid=\"12109\">decrease in night vision</span> (rods are predominantly responsible for vision in low light conditions, the majority of rod cells are located in the peripheral retina), a generalised decrease in visual acuity and macular oedema</li></ul></li><li><span class=\"concept\" data-cid=\"11787\">intravitreal VEGF inhibitors</span><ul><li>often now used in combination with panretinal laser photocoagulation</li><li>examples include ranibizumab</li><li>strong evidence base suggests they both slow progression of proliferative diabetic retinopathy and improve visual acuity</li></ul></li><li>if severe or vitreous haemorrhage: vitreoretinal surgery</li></ul><br /><div class=\"container\"><div class=\"row\"><div class=\"col-md-3\"><a href=\"https://d32xxyeh8kfs8k.cloudfront.net/images_Passmedicine/img053b.jpg\" data-fancybox=\"gallery\" data-caption=\"Diabetic retinopathy previously treated with panretinal laser photocoagulation\"><img  class=\"img-thumbnail mx-auto d-block\" style=\"max-height:150px;margin-bottom:10px;\" src=\"https://d32xxyeh8kfs8k.cloudfront.net/images_Passmedicine/img053.jpg\" alt=\"\" /></a></div></div></div>",

            "The correct answer is <b>Activates plasminogen to form plasmin</b>. Alteplase, also known as tissue plasminogen activator (tPA), is a thrombolytic agent used in the management of acute myocardial infarction. Its mechanism of action involves binding to fibrin in a thrombus (blood clot) and converting the entrapped plasminogen to plasmin. Plasmin then degrades fibrin, leading to clot dissolution and restoration of blood flow.<br /><br />The option <b>ADP-receptor blocker</b> is incorrect. ADP-receptor blockers, such as clopidogrel and ticagrelor, prevent platelet aggregation by blocking the P2Y12 adenosine diphosphate (ADP) receptor on the platelet surface. They are antiplatelet agents rather than thrombolytic agents.<br /><br /><b>Inhibits plasmin</b> is also an incorrect answer. Inhibition of plasmin would promote clot formation rather than dissolution, which is contrary to the therapeutic aim of alteplase.<br /><br />The option <b>Inhibits the conversion of fibrinogen to fibrin</b> describes the mechanism of anticoagulants like heparin and direct thrombin inhibitors but not that of alteplase. These medications prevent new clots from forming or existing clots from expanding, but they do not actively dissolve established clots.<br /><br />Finally, <b>Activates thrombin to form thromboplastin</b> is not correct either. Thrombin acts on fibrinogen to convert it into fibrin, which then polymerises to form a blood clot. Therefore, activating thrombin would promote coagulation rather than breakdown clots as intended with alteplase use.<br />",

        "body": "In 2016 the Chief Medical Officer proposed new guidelines in relation to the safe consumption of alcohol following an expert group report. The most significant change has been a reduction in the number of units it is recommending men do not exceed from 21 to 14, in line with the recommendations for women.<br /><br />The government now recommend the following:<br /><ul><li>men <b>and</b> women should drink no more than 14 units of alcohol per week</li><li>they advise <i>'if you do drink as much as 14 units per week, it is best to spread this evenly over 3 days or more'</i></li><li>pregnant women should not drink. The wording of the official advice is '<i>If you are pregnant or planning a pregnancy, the safest approach is not to drink alcohol at all, to keep risks to your baby to a minimum. Drinking in pregnancy can lead to long-term harm to the baby, with the more you drink the greater the risk.</i>'</li></ul><br />One unit of alcohol is equal to 10 mL of pure ethanol. The 'strength' of an alcoholic drink is determined by the 'alcohol by volume' (ABV).<br /><br />Examples of one unit of alcohol:<br /><ul><li>25ml single measure of spirits (ABV 40%)</li><li>a third of a pint of beer (ABV 5 to 6%)</li><li>half a 175ml 'standard' glass of red wine (ABV 12%)</li></ul><br />To calculate the number of units in a drink multiply the number of millilitres by the ABV and divide by 1,000. For example:<br /><ul><li>half a 175ml 'standard' glass of red wine = 87.5 * 12 / 1000 = 1.05 units</li><li>one bottle of wine = 750 * 12 / 1000 = 9 units</li><li>one pint of 5% beer or lager = 568 * 5 / 1000 = 2.8 units</li></ul>",

            "This patient most likely had an episode of cataplexy. The clues that point towards this include the episode of laughter and history of excessive sleepiness during classes which suggest the patient potentially has narcolepsy. <br /><br />Cardiac syncope is possible and would need to be ruled out with appropriate investigations including an ECG and transthoracic echocardiogram. In this stem, the clues point mainly towards cataplexy making that a more suitable answer. <br /><br />Absence seizures are unlikely in this situation. These would not present with the total loss of limb tone which is apparent here. They would instead present with episodes of blank staring.<br /><br />Generalised epilepsy is also unlikely in this situation. It would present with tonic-clonic seizures that last a few minutes and take significant time to completely recover from; this patient had a sudden loss of muscle tone followed by a quick recovery. <br /><br />Vasovagal syncope is another potential differential in this situation but the scenario lacks clues that point towards it. Usually, these would occur concurrently with an unpleasant experience such as the sigh of blood. In this case, the patient was laughing with friends.",
