        "body": "Age-related macular degeneration is the most common cause of blindness in the UK. Degeneration of the central retina (macula) is the key feature with changes usually bilateral. ARMD is characterised by degeneration of retinal photoreceptors that results in the formation of drusen which can be seen on fundoscopy and retinal photography. It is more common with advancing age and is more common in females.<br /><br />Risk factors<br /><ul><li>advancing age itself is the greatest risk factor for ARMD<ul><li>the risk of ARMD increases 3 fold for patients aged older than 75 years, versus those aged 65-74.</li></ul></li><li><span class=\"concept\" data-cid=\"640\">smoking</span><ul><li>current smokers are twice as likely as non-smokers to have ARMD related visual loss, and ex-smokers have a slightly increased risk of developing the condition, (OR 1.13). </li></ul></li><li>family history is also a strong risk factor for developing ARMD<ul><li>first degree relatives of a sufferer of ARMD are thought to be four times more likely to inherit the condition.</li></ul></li><li>other risk factors for developing the condition include those associated with an increased risk of ischaemic cardiovascular disease, such as hypertension, dyslipidaemia and diabetes mellitus. </li></ul><br /><br /><h5 class='notes-heading'>Classification</h5><br />Traditionally two forms of macular degeneration are seen:<br /><ul><li>dry macular degeneration<ul><li>90% of cases</li><li>also known as atrophic</li><li>characterised by <span class=\"concept\" data-cid=\"639\">drusen</span>  - yellow round spots in Bruch's membrane</li></ul></li><li>wet macular degeneration<ul><li>10% of cases</li><li>also known as exudative or neovascular macular degeneration</li><li>characterised by <span class=\"concept\" data-cid=\"11900\">choroidal neovascularisation</span></li><li>leakage of serous fluid and blood can subsequently result in a rapid loss of vision</li><li>carries the worst prognosis</li></ul></li></ul><br />Recently there has been a move to a more updated classification:<br /><ul><li>early age-related macular degeneration (non-exudative, age-related maculopathy): drusen and alterations to the retinal pigment epithelium (RPE)</li><li>late age-related macular degeneration (neovascularisation, exudative)</li></ul><br /><h5 class='notes-heading'>Clinical features</h5><br />Patients typically present with a subacute onset of visual loss with:<br /><ul><li>a reduction in visual acuity, particularly for near field objects<ul><li>gradual in dry ARMD </li><li>subacute in wet ARMD</li></ul></li><li><span class=\"concept\" data-cid=\"12500\">worse in the centre of vision</span> (e.g. difficulty reading, recognising faces, driving)</li><li>difficulties in dark adaptation with an overall deterioration in vision at night</li><li>fluctuations in visual disturbance which may vary significantly from day to day</li><li>they may also suffer from photopsia, (a perception of flickering or flashing lights), and glare around objects</li><li>visual hallucinations may also occur resulting in Charles-Bonnet syndrome</li></ul><br />Signs:<br /><ul><li>distortion of line perception may be noted on <span class=\"concept\" data-cid=\"11392\">Amsler grid testing</span></li><li>fundoscopy reveals the presence of drusen, yellow areas of pigment deposition in the macular area, which may become confluent in late disease to form a macular scar.</li><li>in wet ARMD well demarcated red patches may be seen which represent intra-retinal or sub-retinal fluid leakage or haemorrhage. </li></ul>   <br />Investigations:<br /><ul><li>slit-lamp microscopy is the initial investigation of choice, to identify any pigmentary, exudative or haemorrhagic changes affecting the retina which may identify the presence of ARMD. This is usually accompanied by colour fundus photography to provide a baseline against which changes can be identified over time.</li><li>fluorescein angiography is utilised if neovascular ARMD is suspected, as this can guide intervention with anti-VEGF therapy. This may be complemented with indocyanine green angiography to visualise any changes in the choroidal circulation. </li><li>optical coherence tomography is used to visualise the retina in three dimensions because it can reveal areas of disease which aren't visible using microscopy alone. </li></ul><br /><h5 class='notes-heading'>Management</h5><br />Treatment<br /><ul><li>the AREDS trial examined the treatment of dry ARMD in 3640 subjects. It showed that a combination of zinc with anti-oxidant vitamins A,C and E reduced progression of the disease by around one third. Patients with more extensive drusen seemed to benefit most from the intervention. Treatment is therefore recommended in patients with at least moderate category dry ARMD. </li><li><span class=\"concept\" data-cid=\"4069\">vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF)</span> <ul><li>VEGR is a potent mitogen and drives increased vascular permeability in patients with wet ARMD</li><li>a number of trials have shown that use of anti-VEGF agents can limit progression of wet ARMD and stabilise or reverse visual loss</li><li>evidence suggests that they should be instituted within the first two months of diagnosis of wet ARMD if possible</li><li>examples of anti-VEGF agents include ranibizumab, <span class=\"concept\" data-cid=\"11448\">bevacizumab</span> and pegaptanib,. The agents are usually administered by 4 weekly injection. </li></ul></li><li>laser photocoagulation does slow progression of ARMD where there is new vessel formation, although there is a risk of acute visual loss after treatment, which may be increased in patients with sub-foveal ARMD. For this reason anti-VEGF therapies are usually preferred.</li></ul>",

            "This question is a test of interpreting spirometry results in the context of a patient presenting with suspected pulmonary fibrosis (a restrictive pulmonary condition that impairs gas exchange). It is important to know that a 'normal' spirometry result has a patient receiving over 80% of their predicted values, and their transfer capacity (TLCO) being normal. If the patient performs lower than 80% of their predicted, the FEV1:FVC ratio can then be assessed. If this ratio is <70%, this is suggestive of an obstructive pulmonary condition (including asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD)), whereas a ratio greater than 70% is suggestive of a restrictive pulmonary condition (such as pulmonary fibrosis).<br /><br />Pulmonary fibrosis is a restrictive condition in which gas exchange is impaired, therefore the results should show <80% of the predicted values for FEV1 and FVC, a FEV1:FVC ratio of >70%, and reduced TLCO. As a result, 'FEV1 = 2.79, FVC = 3.34, TLCO = Decreased' is the correct answer.<br /><br />'FEV1 = 2.64, FVC = 3.41, TLCO = Increased' is an incorrect answer. In these results, a restrictive pattern is seen with a FEV1:FVC of 83.5%, however, the results state an increased TLCO. This is not a typical set of results and would not be the single best answer for this question.<br /><br />'FEV1 = 2.65, FVC = 4.19, TLCO = Decreased' is incorrect. Whilst these results show reduced FEV1 and FVC values, and decreased TLCO (as seen in pulmonary fibrosis), the FEV1:FVC ratio is 63%, which is suggestive of an obstructive cause instead. These results may instead be seen in conditions such as COPD.<br /><br />'FEV1 = 2.79, FVC = 3.11, TLCO = Increased' is not correct. The FEV1:FVC ratio here is 89.7% which may suggest a restrictive pathology, however, the increased TLCO is not typical of the results seen in pulmonary fibrosis, where instead transfer capacity will be decreased.<br /><br />'FEV1 = 4.21, FVC = 5.10, TLCO = Normal' is incorrect.

            "<b>Phenoxybenzamine followed by propranolol</b> is the correct management strategy. Phaeochromocytomas are catecholamine-secreting tumours, leading to excessive stimulation of adrenergic receptors. The primary goal of pre-operative management is to control severe hypertension and prevent life-threatening intra-operative haemodynamic instability. This is achieved by first blocking alpha-adrenergic receptors, which mediate vasoconstriction. Phenoxybenzamine is a long-acting, irreversible alpha-adrenoceptor antagonist that effectively controls blood pressure and allows for plasma volume expansion. It is typically started 10-14 days before surgery. Once adequate alpha-blockade is achieved, a beta-blocker such as propranolol is added. This is necessary to control the reflex tachycardia that often occurs due to alpha-blockade-induced vasodilation and to block the direct cardiac effects of catecholamines. This sequential approach is the cornerstone of safe pre-operative preparation for patients with phaeochromocytoma.<br /><br /><b>Propranolol followed by phenoxybenzamine</b> is incorrect and potentially lethal. Initiating beta-blockade before adequate alpha-blockade is a classic and dangerous error. The circulating catecholamines (adrenaline and noradrenaline) act on both alpha and beta receptors. If beta-receptors are blocked first, particularly the vasodilatory beta-2 receptors in skeletal muscle vasculature, it leads to unopposed alpha-receptor stimulation. This results in intense, uncontrolled vasoconstriction, which can precipitate a severe hypertensive crisis, pulmonary oedema, myocardial infarction, or stroke. The correct sequence of 'alpha-blockade then beta-blockade' must always be followed.<br /><br /><b>Labetalol</b> is a mixed alpha- and beta-adrenoceptor antagonist. While it might seem a logical choice, it is generally avoided for initial pre-operative preparation. The reason is that its beta-blocking activity is significantly more potent than its alpha-blocking activity (the ratio is approximately 7:1 for beta:alpha antagonism with oral administration). Therefore, using labetalol carries a similar risk to using a pure beta-blocker first, as the alpha-blockade may be insufficient to counteract the effects of blocking vasodilatory beta-2 receptors. This can still lead to a paradoxical increase in blood pressure. While intravenous labetalol may have a role in managing an acute phaeochromocytoma crisis, sequential therapy with a pure alpha-blocker is the standard of care for elective pre-operative optimisation.<br /><br /><b>Amlodipine</b> is a dihydropyridine calcium channel blocker. It causes peripheral vasodilation and is an effective antihypertensive agent. In the context of phaeochromocytoma, calcium channel blockers can be used as second or third-line agents if blood pressure remains elevated despite optimal alpha- and beta-blockade. However, amlodipine does not directly address the underlying pathophysiology of excessive adrenergic stimulation. It is not the first-line agent for pre-operative preparation, as specific alpha-adrenoceptor blockade with phenoxybenzamine is required to safely manage the condition and prepare the patient for surgery.<br /><br /><b>Ramipril</b> is an angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor. It acts on the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAAS) and is a common treatment for essential hypertension. However, the hypertension in phaeochromocytoma is driven by catecholamines, not the RAAS. Therefore, ramipril would be ineffective at controlling the blood pressure or preventing the haemodynamic swings associated with this tumour. It has no primary role in the medical management of phaeochromocytoma and would not provide the necessary protection against a peri-operative hypertensive crisis.",

This can still lead to a paradoxical increase in blood pressure. While intravenous labetalol may have a role in managing an acute phaeochromocytoma crisis, sequential therapy with a pure alpha-blocker is the standard of care for elective pre-operative optimisation.<br /><br /><b>Amlodipine</b> is a dihydropyridine calcium channel blocker. It causes peripheral vasodilation and is an effective antihypertensive agent. In the context of phaeochromocytoma, calcium channel blockers can be used as second or third-line agents if blood pressure remains elevated despite optimal alpha- and beta-blockade. However, amlodipine does not directly address the underlying pathophysiology of excessive adrenergic stimulation. It is not the first-line agent for pre-operative preparation, as specific alpha-adrenoceptor blockade with phenoxybenzamine is required to safely manage the condition and prepare the patient for surgery.<br /><br /><b>Ramipril</b> is an angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor. It acts on the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAAS) and is a common treatment for essential hypertension. However, the hypertension in phaeochromocytoma is driven by catecholamines, not the RAAS. Therefore, ramipril would be ineffective at controlling the blood pressure or preventing the haemodynamic swings associated with this tumour. It has no primary role in the medical management of phaeochromocytoma and would not provide the necessary protection against a peri-operative hypertensive crisis.",
