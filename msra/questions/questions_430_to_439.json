            "<b>Amlodipine, atorvastatin, and lifestyle advice</b> is the correct management for this patient. According to NICE guidelines, patients aged 55 years or older with stage 2 hypertension (clinic BP \u2265160/100 mmHg and ABPM average \u2265150/95 mmHg) should be started on a calcium channel blocker (CCB) such as amlodipine as first-line therapy. This patient is 62 years old with confirmed stage 2 hypertension (168/102 mmHg in clinic and 155/98 mmHg on ABPM). Age is a key determinant in the choice of initial antihypertensive therapy, with CCBs being more effective in older patients. Additionally, with a QRisk3 score of 15%, which indicates a high 10-year cardiovascular risk (>10%), statin therapy with atorvastatin is indicated for primary prevention. Lifestyle advice including salt reduction, weight loss, increased physical activity, and moderation of alcohol intake is essential alongside pharmacological management.<br /><br /><b>Ramipril, atorvastatin, and lifestyle advice</b> would not be the most appropriate first-line management. ACE inhibitors like ramipril are recommended as first-line therapy for patients under 55 years of age or those with type 2 diabetes mellitus. For patients aged 55 or older, like this 62-year-old woman, calcium channel blockers are preferred due to their superior efficacy in this age group. While the atorvastatin and lifestyle advice components are appropriate, the choice of antihypertensive does not follow current NICE guidelines for her age group.<br /><br /><b>Bendroflumethiazide, atorvastatin, and lifestyle advice</b> is not the recommended first-line approach. Thiazide diuretics are typically considered as second-line agents in the management of hypertension, usually added when a calcium channel blocker or ACE inhibitor/ARB alone is insufficient. Current guidelines recommend calcium channel blockers as first-line therapy for patients aged 55 years or older with hypertension. While the atorvastatin and lifestyle components are appropriate, bendroflumethiazide is not the optimal initial antihypertensive choice.<br /><br /><b>Amlodipine, lifestyle advice, and review in 3 months</b> is incomplete management. While amlodipine is the correct antihypertensive choice for this patient's age group and lifestyle advice is appropriate, this option omits statin therapy. With a QRisk3 score of 15%, which is well above the 10% threshold, statin therapy is clearly indicated for primary prevention of cardiovascular disease according to NICE guidelines. The elevated total cholesterol of 6.2 mmol/L further supports the need for lipid-lowering therapy.<br /><br /><b>Ramipril, amlodipine, atorvastatin, and lifestyle advice</b> represents an unnecessarily aggressive initial approach. While combination antihypertensive therapy may eventually be required for patients with resistant hypertension, NICE guidelines recommend starting with a single agent (step 1) before progressing to combination therapy (step 2). This patient has newly diagnosed hypertension and should begin with monotherapy using a calcium channel blocker, along with a statin and lifestyle modifications. Starting with dual antihypertensive therapy is not recommended as first-line management and may increase the risk of adverse effects.",

While combination antihypertensive therapy may eventually be required for patients with resistant hypertension, NICE guidelines recommend starting with a single agent (step 1) before progressing to combination therapy (step 2). This patient has newly diagnosed hypertension and should begin with monotherapy using a calcium channel blocker, along with a statin and lifestyle modifications. Starting with dual antihypertensive therapy is not recommended as first-line management and may increase the risk of adverse effects.",

This is because it is associated with weight gain (2-3kg over 1 year).<br /><br />In patients on EIDs who wish to take the COCP (providing there are no contraindications) it is important to inform them that the effectiveness is decreased and there is an increased risk of pregnancy. <br />It is recommended that the dose of oestrogen is increased to 50mcg with no pill-free interval, or reduced to 4 days from 7 days (to reduce the chance of ovulation).  In addition, barrier methods would also be advised.  This applies when the patient is on an EID and for 4 weeks after stopping.<br /><br />In patients on EIDs who wish to take the POP or progesterone implant, then additional barrier contraception would be required while using EIDs and for 4 weeks after stopping.<br /><br />Note - rifampicin and rifabutin are potent EIDs and require longer periods of using barrier contraception after stopping (8 weeks).<br /><br />If emergency contraception is required, the copper intra-uterine device is again the best option.  If levonorgestrel (Levonelle) is used, then double the standard dose is recommended. Ulipristal acetate (ellaOne) is not recommended.<br /><br />FSRH guidelines.<br />",
