            "The correct answer is <b><i>Escherichia coli</i></b>. The most common cause of traveller's diarrhoea, particularly in developing countries like Egypt, is enterotoxigenic <i>Escherichia coli</i> (ETEC). ETEC produces heat-labile and heat-stable toxins which stimulate the secretion of fluid leading to watery diarrhoea. <br /><br /><b><i>Salmonella</i></b>, though a common cause of food poisoning, is less likely in this scenario. Salmonella infection usually presents with symptoms such as fever, abdominal pain and sometimes bloody diarrhoea. It is primarily associated with consuming contaminated eggs or poultry.<br /><br /><b><i>Shigella</i></b>, another potential pathogen causing bacterial dysentery, typically leads to bloody diarrhoea accompanied by fever and abdominal cramps. Shigellosis is transmitted via the faecal-oral route and outbreaks often occur in crowded living conditions with poor sanitation.<br /><br /><b><i>Campylobacter</i></b> infection can also lead to diarrhoeal illness but it tends to be associated with consumption of undercooked poultry or unpasteurised milk. While it can cause watery diarrhoea, it more commonly results in bloody stools.<br /><br />Finally, <b><i>Bacillus cereus</i></b> is an unlikely cause for this patient's symptoms. This organism is usually linked to two types of foodborne illnesses: one type presents as vomiting dominant (due to pre-formed emetic toxin in contaminated food) while the other type presents as diarrhoeal disease (due to production of enterotoxin in the gut after ingestion), both occurring within hours after ingestion of contaminated food items like rice or pasta. Therefore, its association with prolonged travel-related diarrhoea as seen in this case would be unusual.",

Given the history of a recent viral infection, viral labyrinthitis is the most likely answer.<br /><br />Vestibular neuritis is inflammation of the vestibular nerve. It presents very similarly to labyrinthitis. However, hearing loss is not a feature of vestibular neuritis, making labyrinthitis the correct option.<br /><br />Meniere's disease typically presents as a triad of tinnitus, vertigo and sensorineural hearing loss. Vertigo tends to last for minutes-hours at a time, and the disease follows a relapsing and remitting course. A sensation of fullness in the ear is also a common feature. <br /><br />Benign paroxysmal positional vertigo (BPPV) is classically characterised by sudden attacks of vertigo of brief duration (< 30 seconds) brought on by changes in position. Common symptoms include sudden onset of vertigo whilst turning in bed or sitting upright. It is a common condition and becomes more common in middle-age. However, sensorineural hearing loss and prolonged vertigo are not features of BPPV, making it a less likely diagnosis. <br /><br />A cholesteatoma is a growth of keratinised epithelium in the middle ear.

            "The correct answer is cranial nerves V, VII, VIII.<br /><br />The patient has features and imaging compatible with a diagnosis of vestibular schwannoma (acoustic neuroma). The classical history of acoustic neuroma includes a combination of vertigo, sensorineural hearing loss and tinnitus.<br /><br />Acoustic neuroma typically arises from Schwann cells of the vestibulocochlear nerve (CNVIII) at the cerebellopontine junction. The sensorineural hearing loss, vertigo, and tinnitus are caused by tumoral infiltration into CN VIII. The location of the tumour can most commonly result in pathology of CN V, VII and VIII, which all pass closely to the cerebellopontine junction. This may result in an absent corneal reflex due to a lesion in CN V or facial palsy due to a lesion in CN VII.<br /><br />The option II, VII, and VIII is incorrect because the optic nerve (CN II) arises from the cerebrum so it is unaffected.<br /><br />The option II, VIII, and IX is wrong because both cranial nerves II is unaffected. Involvement of the lower cranial nerves (IX arises from the medulla) can occur in very large tumours but this is much rarer.<br /><br />The option III, VIII, and IX is incorrect because CN III arises from the midbrain and IX arises from the medulla.<br /><br />The option VII, VIII, and X is incorrect because CN X arises from the medulla - like IX it can be affected only if the tumour is very large.",

        "question": "A 35-year-old man presents to his general practitioner with a history of right-sided hearing loss, vertigo and tinnitus.<br /><br />Cranial MRI demonstrates a mass at the cerebellopontine junction. <br /><br />Given the most likely diagnosis, which one of the following cranial nerves are most likely to be affected?",
        "correct_answer": "4",
        "question_notes": "The correct answer is cranial nerves V, VII, VIII.<br /><br />The patient has features and imaging compatible with a diagnosis of vestibular schwannoma (acoustic neuroma). The classical history of acoustic neuroma includes a combination of vertigo, sensorineural hearing loss and tinnitus.<br /><br />Acoustic neuroma typically arises from Schwann cells of the vestibulocochlear nerve (CNVIII) at the cerebellopontine junction. The sensorineural hearing loss, vertigo, and tinnitus are caused by tumoral infiltration into CN VIII. The location of the tumour can most commonly result in pathology of CN V, VII and VIII, which all pass closely to the cerebellopontine junction. This may result in an absent corneal reflex due to a lesion in CN V or facial palsy due to a lesion in CN VII.<br /><br />The option II, VII, and VIII is incorrect because the optic nerve (CN II) arises from the cerebrum so it is unaffected.<br /><br />The option II, VIII, and IX is wrong because both cranial nerves II is unaffected. Involvement of the lower cranial nerves (IX arises from the medulla) can occur in very large tumours but this is much rarer.<br /><br />The option III, VIII, and IX is incorrect because CN III arises from the midbrain and IX arises from the medulla.<br /><br />The option VII, VIII, and X is incorrect because CN X arises from the medulla - like IX it can be affected only if the tumour is very large.",

The pupil may be small and irregularly shaped due to spasm of the sphincter muscle in the iris. This presentation aligns with the symptoms described by the patient. <br /><br /><b>Conjunctivitis</b> is an inflammation or infection of the conjunctiva, which covers the white part of the eyeball. It is typically associated with redness, itching and discharge from the eye, but not usually pain or photophobia. The pupil would not appear small or irregular in shape.<br /><br /><b>Scleritis</b> refers to inflammation of the sclera (the white outer coating of the eye), and it can indeed cause severe eye pain. However, it does not typically cause a change in pupil size or shape. In addition, photophobia is less common than in anterior uveitis.<br /><br /><b>Meningitis</b>, an inflammation of the meninges around the brain and spinal cord, can present with various symptoms such as headache, fever and neck stiffness. Photophobia can also be a symptom due to irritation of meninges around the optic nerve but it would not cause changes in pupil size or shape unless there are serious complications affecting cranial nerves.<br /><br />Finally, <b>Acute angle closure glaucoma</b> could potentially fit some elements of this scenario - it causes severe eye pain and can lead to a mid-dilated unresponsive pupil rather than a small one.
