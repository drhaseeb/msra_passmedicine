Desmopressin may help achieve short-term control if that is the priority (e.g. for sleepovers). An important side effect to be aware of is hyponatraemia, although NICE guidelines do not routinely recommend U&E or osmolality studies for children on desmopressin treatment.<br /><br /><b>Desmopressin plus oxybutynin</b> can be helpful if there are daytime symptoms or if there is little to no improvement on desmopressin alone.

            "<b>Azithromycin</b> is the correct answer. According to the British Association for Sexual Health and HIV (BASHH) guidelines, azithromycin is the first-line treatment for uncomplicated genital chlamydial infection in pregnancy. It is a macrolide antibiotic with a good safety profile in pregnancy and a simple dosing regimen (typically a single 1g dose), which promotes adherence. Given that the patient is 14 weeks pregnant and has a confirmed diagnosis of <i>Chlamydia</i>, this is the most appropriate and effective treatment to prevent maternal complications, such as pelvic inflammatory disease, and neonatal complications, such as conjunctivitis and pneumonia.<br /><br /><b>Amoxicillin</b> is an incorrect choice. While amoxicillin is considered safe in pregnancy, it is only recommended as an alternative agent for treating chlamydia in pregnancy if macrolides (like azithromycin or erythromycin) are contraindicated or not tolerated. Its efficacy is generally considered lower than that of azithromycin, and it requires a longer course of treatment. Therefore, it is not the first-line choice for this patient.<br /><br /><b>Cefixime</b> is incorrect. Cefixime is a cephalosporin antibiotic that is effective against <i>Neisseria gonorrhoeae</i> but has no activity against <i>Chlamydia trachomatis</i>. It is often used as part of the treatment for gonorrhoea. Since this patient has a confirmed diagnosis of chlamydia, not gonorrhoea, cefixime would be an ineffective treatment.<br /><br /><b>Doxycycline</b> is incorrect. Doxycycline is the first-line treatment for chlamydia in non-pregnant adults. However, it is a tetracycline antibiotic and is contraindicated in the second and third trimesters of pregnancy due to the risk of permanent discolouration of the baby's teeth and potential effects on bone development. Although the risk is lower in the first trimester, it is generally avoided throughout pregnancy when safer and effective alternatives like azithromycin are available. For this 14-week pregnant patient, doxycycline is not the most appropriate choice.<br /><br /><b>Erythromycin</b> is an incorrect choice. Erythromycin is another macrolide antibiotic that is considered safe and effective for chlamydia in pregnancy. However, it is now considered a second-line or alternative option to azithromycin. This is primarily because it requires a longer, multi-day dosing schedule and is associated with a higher incidence of gastrointestinal side effects (e.g., nausea, vomiting), which can lead to poor adherence and treatment failure. Azithromycin is preferred due to its simpler regimen and better tolerability.",

This patient has completed her family and wishes to avoid pregnancy, making the intrauterine system ideal. The levonorgestrel-releasing IUS reduces menstrual blood loss by up to 95% by causing endometrial atrophy and is highly effective contraception. It can be inserted in primary care and provides long-term management (effective for 5 years). The patient's normal examination findings make this an appropriate choice without need for further investigation before treatment. The IUS should be considered first-line in women requiring contraception as it addresses both the heavy bleeding and contraceptive needs simultaneously, avoiding the need for daily medication.<br /><br /><b>Combined oral contraceptive pill</b> is a reasonable option for women requiring contraception with heavy menstrual bleeding and can reduce menstrual blood loss by approximately 40-50%. However, according to current NICE guidance, the intrauterine system should be considered first-line in women requiring contraception due to its superior efficacy in reducing menstrual blood loss and its long-acting nature. The combined pill would be an appropriate second-line option if the IUS was declined or contraindicated.<br /><br /><b>Mefenamic acid</b> is an appropriate first-line treatment for heavy menstrual bleeding in women who do not require contraception, particularly when dysmenorrhoea is also present. It reduces menstrual blood loss by approximately 30% through its anti-prostaglandin effects. However, this patient specifically requires contraception, making options that provide both contraception and treatment of heavy bleeding more appropriate. Mefenamic acid would require her to use separate contraception.<br /><br /><b>Tranexamic acid</b> is another first-line option for women with heavy menstrual bleeding who do not require contraception. It reduces blood loss by approximately 50% through its antifibrinolytic action. Like mefenamic acid, it is taken during menstruation only. However, since this patient requires contraception, treatments that address both needs simultaneously are preferred according to NICE guidance. She would need separate contraceptive arrangements if using tranexamic acid.<br /><br /><b>Endometrial ablation</b> is a second-line treatment option for heavy menstrual bleeding when medical management has failed or is unsuitable. It is not appropriate as initial management, particularly when first-line medical options have not been tried. Endometrial ablation requires referral to secondary care and, whilst it provides good symptom control, the intrauterine system should be trialled first as it is less invasive, reversible, and can be managed in primary care.",

            "<b>Transcatheter aortic valve replacement</b> is correct. This patient has symptoms and signs of aortic stenosis including exertional dyspnoea and dizziness in association with an ejection systolic murmur. The echocardiogram results are supportive of this diagnosis. This patient is symptomatic with his aortic stenosis given the progressive nature of his symptoms and, therefore, warrants further intervention. A transcatheter aortic valve implantation (TAVI) is a suitable surgical approach, particularly in patients who may have a high peri-operative risk. It has the same efficacy as surgical aortic valve replacement.<br /><br /><b>Balloon valvuloplasty</b> is incorrect. This is an option for the management of aortic stenosis. However, it is less commonly offered as its efficacy lasts for approximately 6-12 months. Therefore, the procedure is often reserved for people who cannot undergo any surgical intervention.<br /><br /><b>Beta-blockers</b> is incorrect. This is used in the management of angina and heart failure. However, it plays no role in the management of aortic stenosis. <br /><br /><b>Carotid endarterectomy</b> is incorrect. This is used in the management of carotid stenosis that, if severe, can cause symptoms of an ischaemic stroke (e.g. facial dropping, dysphasia, etc.). It plays no role in the management of aortic stenosis.<br /><br /><b>Watch and wait</b> is incorrect. This tends to be the management for patients with asymptomatic aortic stenosis. However, as this patient has exertional dyspnoea and dizziness that is impacting daily activities, an intervention is required.",

        "question": "An 81-year-old man presents to his GP with a 4-week history of progressive shortness of breath and dizziness on exertion. He normally walks his dog each morning for 30 minutes but now reports feeling light-headed after 5 minutes. His past medical history includes hypercholesterolaemia and hypertension.<br /><br />On examination, he has a heart rate of 67 beats/min with a blood pressure of 145/70mmHg. There is an audible ejection systolic murmur that radiates to the carotids.<br /><br />Echocardiogram: Thickened aortic valve leaflets with restricted movement. <br /><br />What is the most appropriate management for this patient?",
        "correct_answer": "4",
        "question_notes": "<b>Transcatheter aortic valve replacement</b> is correct. This patient has symptoms and signs of aortic stenosis including exertional dyspnoea and dizziness in association with an ejection systolic murmur. The echocardiogram results are supportive of this diagnosis. This patient is symptomatic with his aortic stenosis given the progressive nature of his symptoms and, therefore, warrants further intervention. A transcatheter aortic valve implantation (TAVI) is a suitable surgical approach, particularly in patients who may have a high peri-operative risk. It has the same efficacy as surgical aortic valve replacement.<br /><br /><b>Balloon valvuloplasty</b> is incorrect. This is an option for the management of aortic stenosis. However, it is less commonly offered as its efficacy lasts for approximately 6-12 months. Therefore, the procedure is often reserved for people who cannot undergo any surgical intervention.<br /><br /><b>Beta-blockers</b> is incorrect. This is used in the management of angina and heart failure. However, it plays no role in the management of aortic stenosis. <br /><br /><b>Carotid endarterectomy</b> is incorrect. This is used in the management of carotid stenosis that, if severe, can cause symptoms of an ischaemic stroke (e.g. facial dropping, dysphasia, etc.). It plays no role in the management of aortic stenosis.<br /><br /><b>Watch and wait</b> is incorrect. This tends to be the management for patients with asymptomatic aortic stenosis. However, as this patient has exertional dyspnoea and dizziness that is impacting daily activities, an intervention is required.",
