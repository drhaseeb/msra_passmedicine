        "body": "In X-linked recessive inheritance only males are affected. An exception to this seen in examinations are patients with Turner's syndrome, who are affected due to only having one X chromosome. X-linked recessive disorders are transmitted by heterozygote females (carriers) and male-to-male transmission is not seen. Affected males can only have unaffected sons and carrier daughters.<br /><br />Each male child of a heterozygous female carrier has a 50% chance of being affected whilst each female child of a heterozygous female carrier has a 50% chance of being a carrier.<br /><br />The possibility of an affected father having children with a heterozygous female carrier is generally speaking extremely rare. However, in certain Afro-Caribbean communities G6PD deficiency is relatively common and homozygous females with clinical manifestations of the enzyme defect are seen.",

They have been having regular unprotected intercourse for 14 months and have not conceived yet. Semen analysis from the husband was normal. The GP requests a serum progesterone to check for ovulation.<br /><br />When should this blood test be taken?",

        "question_notes": "Serum progesterone is taken to confirm ovulation in patients who are struggling to conceive. It should be taken <b>7 days before the next expected period</b> to coincide with ovulation.<br /><br /><b>14 days before the next expected period</b> is incorrect as it would not be timed correctly with the expected day of ovulation.<br /><br />Taking the serum progesterone on the <b>first day of her next period</b> would be too late and would be after ovulation had occurred.<br /><br />Serum progesterone does not have to be taken <b>the day after unprotected sexual intercourse</b> as it confirms ovulation, which is unaffected by the timing of intercourse.<br /><br /><b>The timing is not important</b> is incorrect. Serum progesterone levels are taken to confirm ovulation during a patient's menstrual cycle and so timing it with the expected day of ovulation is very important.",

In healthy individuals, this is met by an upregulation of endogenous cortisol production via the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis.<br /><br />However, patients on long-term corticosteroid therapy may have suppression of the HPA axis and are therefore unable to mount an adequate endogenous stress response.

        "body": "A cataract is a common eye condition where the lens of the eye gradually opacifies i.e. becomes cloudy. This cloudiness makes it more difficult for light to reach the back of the eye (retina), thus causing reduced/blurred vision. Cataracts are the leading cause of curable blindness worldwide.<br /><br />Epidemiology<br /><ul><li>Cataracts are more common in women than in men</li><li>The incidence of cataracts increases with age. One study found that 30% of individuals aged 65 and over had a visually-impairing cataract in either one or both eyes</li></ul>\t<br />Causes<br /><ul><li><span class=\"concept\" data-cid=\"9546\">Normal ageing process: most common cause</span></li></ul><br />Other possible causes<br /><ul><li>Smoking</li><li>Increased alcohol consumption</li><li>Trauma</li><li>Diabetes mellitus</li><li><span class=\"concept\" data-cid=\"6026\">Long-term corticosteroids</span></li><li>Radiation exposure</li><li><span class=\"concept\" data-cid=\"5143\">Myotonic dystrophy</span></li><li>Metabolic disorders: <span class=\"concept\" data-cid=\"5142\">hypocalcaemia</span></li></ul><br />Patients typically present with a gradual onset of:<br /><ul><li>Reduced vision</li><li>Faded colour vision: making it more difficult to distinguish different colours</li><li>Glare: lights appear brighter than usual</li><li>Halos around lights</li></ul><br />Signs:<br /><ul><li>A Defect in the red reflex: the red reflex is essentially the reddish-orange reflection seen through an ophthalmoscope when a light is shone on the retina. Cataracts will prevent light from getting to the retina, hence you see a defect in the red reflex.</li></ul><br />Investigations:<br /><ul><li>Ophthalmoscopy: done after pupil dilation. Findings: normal fundus and optic nerve</li><li>Slit-lamp examination. Findings: visible cataract </li></ul><br />Classification<br /><ul><li><span class=\"concept\" data-cid=\"9420\">Nuclear</span>: change lens refractive index, common in old age</li><li>Polar: localized, commonly inherited, lie in the visual axis</li><li>Subcapsular: due to <span class=\"concept\" data-cid=\"2728\">steroid</span> use, just deep to the lens capsule, in the visual axis</li><li>Dot opacities: common in normal lenses, also seen in diabetes and myotonic dystrophy</li></ul><br />Management<br /><ul><li>Non-surgical: In the early stages, age-related cataracts can be managed conservatively by prescribing stronger glasses/contact lens, or by encouraging the use of brighter lighting. These options help optimise vision but do not actually slow down the progression of cataracts, therefore surgery will eventually be needed.</li><li>Surgery: Surgery is the only effective treatment for cataracts. This involves removing the cloudy lens and replacing this with an artificial one. <span class=\"concept\" data-cid=\"9745\">NICE suggests that referral for surgery should be dependent upon whether a visual impairment is present, impact on quality of life, and patient choice</span>. Also whether both eyes are affected and the possible risks and benefits of surgery should be taken into account.  Prior to cataract surgery, patients should be provided with information on the refractive implications of various types of intraocular lenses. After cataract surgery, patients should be advised on the use of eye drops and eyewear, what to do if vision changes and the management of other ocular problems. Cataract surgery has a high success rate with 85-90% of patients achieving 6/12 corrected vision (on a Snellen chart) postoperatively. </li></ul>\t<br />Complications following surgery<br /><ul><li><span class=\"concept\" data-cid=\"4075\">Posterior capsule opacification</span>: thickening of the lens capsule</li><li>Retinal detachment</li><li>Posterior capsule rupture</li><li><span class=\"concept\" data-cid=\"10758\">Endophthalmitis</span>: inflammation of aqueous and/or vitreous humour</li></ul><br /><CENTER><table><tr><td align = 'left' colspan='2'><a data-fancybox class='fancybox' rel='group' href='https://d32xxyeh8kfs8k.cloudfront.net/images_Passmedicine/pdd136b.jpg'><img class='ajaximage' src='https://d32xxyeh8kfs8k.cloudfront.net/images_Passmedicine/pdd136.jpg'/></a></td></tr><tr><td valign='top' align='left'></td><td align='right'><a data-fancybox class='fancybox lbmagglasslink' rel='group' href='https://d32xxyeh8kfs8k.cloudfront.net/images_Passmedicine/pdd136b.jpg'><img src='https://d32xxyeh8kfs8k.cloudfront.net/css/images/mag_glass.png'/></a></td></tr></table></CENTER><div class='imagetext'>A hypermature age-related cortico-nuclear cataract with a brunescent (brown) nucleus.
