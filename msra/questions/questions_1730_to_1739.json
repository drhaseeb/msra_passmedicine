            "This child has had a diarrhoeal illness, likely related to eating undercooked meat at a carnival, and now presents unwell with several abnormal examination findings. Whilst poor urine output could be related to dehydration, the stem is clear that the child has been taking in good amounts of fluid. The oliguria, coupled with peripheral oedema, suggests an underlying acute kidney injury. The petechial bruising and pallor suggest haematological abnormalities. Overall, this picture is in keeping with haemolytic uraemic syndrome (HUS).  HUS is characterised by a triad of normocytic anaemia, thrombocytopenia and acute kidney injury. Most cases occur in children and most are associated with diarrhoeal illnesses. The most common cause is Shiga-toxin producing <i><b>Escherichia coli</i></b>, particularly the O157:H7 strain. Uncooked meat - such as a chicken burger from a carnival - is a common source of <i>Escherichia coli</i> infection. <br /><br /><i><b>Campylobacter jejuni</i></b> is a leading cause of acute diarrhoea, with approximately one quarter of cases involving bloody diarrhoea. Raw or undercooked meat - particularly chicken - is a common source. However, the illness is usually mild, and not in itself associated with anaemia, renal failure or thrombocytopenia. Whilst there are causes of <i>Campylobacter jejuni</i> associated HUS, which would explain the examination findings seen in this patient, it is a very rare cause of HUS and certainly not the most likely differential in this case. <br /><br /><i><b>Clostridium perfringens</i></b> is another common cause of food-borne illness and causes acute diarrhoea and vomiting. It is not associated with HUS. Whilst vomiting and diarrhoea alone could cause an acute kidney injury alone, this would be related to hypovolaemia (which is unlikely in this child who has been receiving lots of fluid). Furthermore, it would not cause signs of anaemia or thrombocytopenia. <br /><br /><i><b>Salmonella</i></b> species cause diarrhoeal illnesses (although usually not with bloody diarrhoea) after ingestion of contaminated food. Whilst they can be implicated in the development of HUS, this is not common. <i>Escherichia coli</i> is a far more likely causative organism in this patient.<br /><br /><i><b>Shigella</i></b> species cause diarrhoeal illnesses (which can involve bloody diarrhoea) after ingestion of contaminated food (including undercooked meat) and water. Infection is typically mild; As above, the findings consistent with anaemia, thrombocytopenia and acute renal failure both suggest HUS, rather than simple infection alone. Whilst some <i>Shigella</i> species can produce toxins causing HUS, this is a far less common cause of HUS than <i>Escherichia coli</i> and hence is not the most likely causative organism in this patient.",

            "<b>Severe asthma treated with oral corticosteroids</b> is the correct answer. Ulipristal acetate is a selective progesterone receptor modulator (SPRM). Its primary mechanism of action is delaying or inhibiting ovulation. Glucocorticoids, which are used to manage severe asthma, also act on steroid receptors. There is a theoretical concern, highlighted by the Faculty of Sexual and Reproductive Healthcare (FSRH) in the UK, that concomitant use of high-dose glucocorticoids could reduce the efficacy of ulipristal acetate, potentially leading to contraceptive failure. Therefore, FSRH guidance advises that ulipristal acetate should be used with caution in women with severe asthma that is controlled with oral glucocorticoids. In this scenario, where the patient is presenting at 80 hours post-UPSI, ulipristal acetate would normally be the preferred oral option over levonorgestrel (licensed up to 72 hours). However, this history of severe asthma necessitates a careful risk-benefit discussion. The most effective overall emergency contraception, the copper intrauterine device (IUD), should be strongly recommended. If an oral method is still preferred, levonorgestrel could be considered as an alternative, although its effectiveness at 80 hours is reduced and its use would be off-licence.<br /><br /><b>Previous ectopic pregnancy</b> is an incorrect option. While a history of an ectopic pregnancy is a significant risk factor for a future ectopic pregnancy, it is not a contraindication to the use of any form of hormonal emergency contraception, including ulipristal acetate or levonorgestrel. These methods work primarily by preventing ovulation or fertilisation and do not increase the risk of an ectopic pregnancy. A copper IUD can also be used for emergency contraception in women with a history of ectopic pregnancy. The concern regarding IUDs and ectopic pregnancy relates more to their use for ongoing contraception, where if a pregnancy does occur, it is more likely to be ectopic, but the overall risk of pregnancy (and therefore ectopic pregnancy) is extremely low.<br /><br /><b>Migraine with aura</b> is incorrect. This is a common point of confusion for trainees. Migraine with aura is a UKMEC (UK Medical Eligibility Criteria for Contraceptive Use) category 4 contraindication for oestrogen-containing contraceptives, such as the combined oral contraceptive pill, due to an increased risk of ischaemic stroke. However, this risk is associated with the oestrogen component. Progestogen-only methods, including ulipristal acetate and levonorgestrel for emergency contraception, do not contain oestrogen and are considered safe to use (UKMEC 1) in women with a history of migraine with or without aura. Therefore, this history would not influence the choice or safety of prescribing ulipristal acetate.<br /><br /><b>BMI of 32 kg/m\u00b2</b> is an incorrect choice. Raised body mass index (BMI) or body weight may reduce the efficacy of oral emergency contraception. For levonorgestrel, FSRH guidance recommends doubling the dose (to 3mg) for women with a BMI >26 kg/m\u00b2 or weight >70kg. For ulipristal acetate, evidence is less conclusive, but some data suggests a possible reduction in efficacy in women with a higher BMI. However, it is not a contraindication, and FSRH guidance states that it can still be offered as it is likely to be more effective than a standard dose of levonorgestrel. The most effective method in this group remains the copper IUD. While BMI is an important consideration, the specific caution regarding severe asthma and potential drug interaction represents a more critical factor influencing the choice of prescription.<br /><br /><b>Currently breastfeeding</b> is incorrect. This factor is important for counselling but is not the most critical medical consideration regarding the drug's efficacy. Ulipristal acetate is excreted into breast milk, and its effects on the infant are unknown. Therefore, the manufacturer and FSRH advise that breastfeeding should be discontinued for one week after taking ulipristal. In contrast, levonorgestrel is considered safe to use during breastfeeding with no interruption needed. This difference would certainly influence the patient's choice between the two oral methods. However, the concern with severe asthma relates directly to a potential failure of the medication to prevent pregnancy, which is a more significant clinical risk than the temporary need to interrupt breastfeeding.",

If we just rely on clinic readings then such patients may be diagnosed as having hypertension when, the vast majority of the time, their blood pressure is normal.<br /><br />This has led to the use of both ambulatory blood pressure monitoring (ABPM) and home blood pressure monitoring (HBPM) to confirm the diagnosis of hypertension. These techniques allow a more accurate assessment of a patients' overall blood pressure. Not only does this help prevent overdiagnosis of hypertension - ABPM has been shown to be a more accurate predictor of cardiovascular events than clinic readings.<br /><br /><h5 class='notes-heading'>Blood pressure classification</h5><br />This becomes relevant later in some of the management decisions that NICE advocate.<br /><br /><div class=\"table-responsive\"><table class = \"tlarge table table-striped table-bordered\"  data-role=\"table\" id=\"tableid1\" ><thead><tr><th><b>Stage</b></th><th><b>Criteria</b></th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td><b>Stage 1 hypertension</b></td><td>Clinic BP >= 140/90 mmHg and subsequent ABPM daytime average or HBPM average BP >= 135/85 mmHg</td></tr><tr><td><b>Stage 2 hypertension</b></td><td>Clinic BP >= 160/100 mmHg and subsequent ABPM daytime average or HBPM average BP >= 150/95 mmHg</td></tr><tr><td><b>Severe hypertension</b></td><td>Clinic systolic BP >= 180 mmHg, or clinic diastolic BP >= 120 mmHg</td></tr></tbody></table></div><br /><h5 class='notes-heading'>Diagnosing hypertension</h5><br />Firstly, NICE recommend measuring blood pressure in both arms when considering a diagnosis of hypertension. <br /><br />If the difference in readings between arms is more than 20 mmHg then the measurements should be repeated. If the difference remains > 20 mmHg then subsequent blood pressures should be recorded from the arm with the higher reading.<br /><br />It should of course be remember that there are pathological causes of unequal blood pressure readings from the arms, such as supravalvular aortic stenosis. It is therefore prudent to listen to the heart sounds if a difference exists and further investigation if a very large difference is noted.<br /><br />NICE also recommend taking a second reading during the consultation, if the first reading is > 140/90 mmHg.

            "<b>Intramuscular methylprednisolone</b> is the correct answer. This patient is experiencing an acute flare of her rheumatoid arthritis, as evidenced by the rapid onset of worsening pain, swelling, and morning stiffness that is impacting her function. According to UK guidelines (NICE), the immediate management of an acute flare involves the use of corticosteroids to rapidly reduce inflammation and alleviate symptoms. An intramuscular injection of a depot steroid like methylprednisolone is a common and effective strategy. It provides a rapid onset of action and sustained relief over several weeks, acting as a 'bridge' to either allow the flare to settle or for adjustments in long-term therapy to take effect. This approach is often preferred over oral prednisolone as it ensures adherence and avoids potential gastrointestinal side effects. The goal is to regain control of the inflammation quickly, improve the patient's quality of life, and prevent further joint damage. While her long-term DMARD regimen may need review, the priority is to manage the acute, debilitating symptoms she is currently experiencing.<br /><br /><b>Add hydroxychloroquine</b> is an incorrect choice for immediate management. Hydroxychloroquine is a conventional synthetic disease-modifying anti-rheumatic drug (csDMARD) used for the long-term control of rheumatoid arthritis. While it can be used in combination therapy (e.g., with methotrexate and sulfasalazine as 'triple therapy'), its onset of action is very slow, typically taking 2-6 months to exert its full therapeutic effect. Therefore, adding it to her current regimen would not provide the rapid symptom relief required to manage this acute flare. The decision to add another DMARD would be made by a rheumatologist as part of a long-term strategy review, likely after the current flare has been brought under control.<br /><br /><b>Increase methotrexate dose</b> is not the most appropriate immediate step. While optimising the dose of methotrexate is a key part of long-term RA management, it is not a treatment for an acute flare. Similar to other DMARDs, the therapeutic effects of a methotrexate dose adjustment are not immediate and can take 4-6 weeks to become apparent. The patient requires prompt relief from her inflammatory symptoms. Although her flare may indicate that her baseline disease control is suboptimal and a dose increase might be considered later, the acute management takes precedence. The immediate priority is to suppress the severe inflammation with a rapid-acting agent like a corticosteroid.<br /><br /><b>Refer for joint replacement surgery</b> is inappropriate in this context. Joint replacement surgery (arthroplasty) is a treatment for end-stage, destructive arthritis where irreversible joint damage has led to chronic pain, deformity, and severe functional limitation. This patient is presenting with an acute inflammatory flare, which is a reversible process that should be managed medically. There is no information in the scenario to suggest she has the kind of advanced, erosive joint damage that would warrant a surgical referral. The focus of management should be on controlling the active inflammation to prevent such long-term damage from occurring.<br /><br /><b>Start a TNF-alpha inhibitor</b> is incorrect. TNF-alpha inhibitors are biologic DMARDs (bDMARDs) used for moderate-to-severe RA that has not responded to adequate trials of at least two different csDMARDs, including methotrexate. Starting a biologic is a significant therapeutic step-up, managed by a specialist rheumatologist, and requires careful consideration and screening (e.g., for latent tuberculosis). It is not used as a first-line treatment for an isolated acute flare in a patient already on csDMARDs. The immediate goal is to control the flare; a decision about escalating to biologic therapy would only be made after assessing the overall long-term disease activity and response to csDMARDs.",
