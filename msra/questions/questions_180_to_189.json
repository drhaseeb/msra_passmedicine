        "title": "Reduced fetal movements",
        "body": "<h5 class='notes-heading'> Introduction </h5><br />Reduced fetal movements can represent fetal distress, as a method of fetal compensation to reduce oxygen consumption as a response to chronic hypoxia in utero. This is concerning, as it reflects risk of stillbirth and fetal growth restriction. It is believed that there may also be a link between reduced fetal movements and placental insufficiency. <br /><br /><h5 class='notes-heading'> Physiology </h5><br />The first onset of recognised fetal movements is known as quickening. This usually occurs between 18-20 weeks gestation, and increase until 32 weeks gestation at which point the frequency of movement tends to plateau. Multiparous women will usually experience fetal movements sooner, from 16-18 weeks gestation. Towards the end of pregnancy, fetal movements should not reduce.<br /><br />Expectant mothers will usually quickly recognise a pattern to these movements. The nature of the movements themselves can be very variable. There is no established definition for what constitutes reduced fetal movements (RFM), but the RCOG considers less than 10 movements within 2 hours (in pregnancies past 28 weeks gestation) an indication for further assessment.<br /><br /><h5 class='notes-heading'> Epidemiology </h5><br />Fetal movements should be established by 24 weeks gestation.<br /><br />Reduced fetal movements is a fairly common presentation, affecting up to 15% of pregnancies. 3-5% of pregnant women will have recurrent presentations with RFM.<br /><br /> Risk factors for reduced fetal movements<br /><ul><li>Posture<ul><li>There can be positional changes in fetal movement awareness, generally being more prominent during lying down and less when sitting and standing</li></ul></li><li>Distraction<ul><li>Awareness of fetal movements can be distractable, and if a woman is busy or concentrating on something else, these can be less prominent</li></ul></li><li>Placental position<ul><li>Patient with anterior placentas prior to 28 weeks gestation may have lesser awareness of fetal movements</li></ul></li><li>Medication<ul><li>Both alcohol and sedative medications like opiates or benzodiazepines can temporarily cause reduced fetal movements</li></ul></li><li>Fetal position <ul><li>Anterior fetal position means movements are less noticeable</li></ul></li><li>Body habitus<ul><li>Obese patients are less likely to feel prominent fetal movements</li></ul></li><li>Amniotic fluid volume<ul><li>Both oligohydramnios and polyhydramnios can cause reduction in fetal movements</li></ul></li><li>Fetal size<ul><li>Up to 29% of women presenting with RFM have a SGA fetus</li></ul></li></ul><br /><h5 class='notes-heading'> Investigations </h5><br />Fetal movements are usually based solely on maternal perception, though it can also be objectively assessed using <span class=\"concept\" data-cid=\"10973\">handheld Doppler</span> or ultrasonography.<br /><br />As per RCOG Green-top guidelines, investigations are dependent of gestation at onset of RFM.<br /><br /><ul><li>If past 28 weeks gestation:<ul><li>Initially, handheld Doppler should be used to confirm fetal heartbeat.</li><li>If no fetal heartbeat detectable, <span class=\"concept\" data-cid=\"10975\">immediate ultrasound</span> should be offered.</li><li>If fetal heartbeat present, CTG should be used for at least 20 minutes to monitor fetal heart rate which can assist in excluding fetal compromise.</li><li>If concern remains, despite normal CTG, urgent (within 24 hours) ultrasound can be used. Ultrasound assessment should include abdominal circumference or estimated fetal weight (to exclude SGA), and amniotic fluid volume measurement</li></ul></li><li>If between 24 and 28 weeks gestation, a handheld Doppler should be used to confirm presence of fetal heartbeat.</li><li>If below 24 weeks gestation, and fetal movements have previously been felt, a handheld Doppler should be used.</li><li>If fetal movements have not yet been felt by <span class=\"concept\" data-cid=\"10974\">24 weeks</span>, onward referral should be made to a maternal fetal medicine unit.</li></ul><br />If RFM are recurrent, further investigations are also required to consider structural or genetic fetal abnormalities.<br /><br /><h5 class='notes-heading'> Prognosis </h5><br />Concern regarding absent or reduced fetal movements stems for the potential for this presentation to represent fetal distress or impending demise. Between 40-55% of women who suffer from stillbirth experience reduced fetal movements prior to diagnosis.<br /><br />However, in 70% of pregnancies with a single episode of reduced fetal movement, there is no onward complication.",

            "The correct answer is <b>Reduced frequency of exacerbations</b>. Inhaled corticosteroids (ICS) are used in the management of COPD primarily to reduce the frequency of exacerbations. This is based on evidence from numerous clinical trials, which have shown that ICS use in COPD patients reduces the rate of exacerbations, especially in those with a history of frequent exacerbations. This therapeutic benefit can significantly improve patient's quality of life and decrease hospital admissions.<br /><br />The option <b>Reduced severity of exacerbations</b> is incorrect. While it might seem logical that if ICS can reduce the frequency of exacerbations, they could also reduce their severity, current evidence does not support this. The severity of an exacerbation when it occurs is not influenced by prior use of ICS.<br /><br /><b>Improved all cause mortality</b> is also incorrect. Although reducing the number and severity of COPD exacerbations has important benefits for patients' quality of life, there's no robust evidence to suggest that these drugs improve all-cause mortality in COPD patients.<br /><br /><b>Reduced use of bronchodilators</b> as an option is misleading. While it's true that effective control of COPD symptoms might result in less need for rescue medication such as short-acting bronchodilators, this isn't a primary therapeutic goal or effect of ICS therapy itself.<br /><br />Finally, <b>Slows decline in FEV1</b>, while desirable, is not a proven benefit associated with ICS use in COPD patients. The decline in FEV1 (Forced Expiratory Volume in 1 second), a measure indicating disease progression in COPD, continues at its natural pace even with ICS treatment according to most research studies.<br />",

            "<b>Ibuprofen</b> is the correct answer and represents the first-line treatment for acute paediatric migraine. This patient presents with features consistent with migraine without aura: recurrent headaches with bilateral frontal location, pulsating quality, moderate intensity aggravated by physical activity (netball), and accompanying nausea. Evidence suggests that ibuprofen is more effective than paracetamol for treating acute migraine episodes in children. It should be given at the onset of symptoms to maximise efficacy. The anti-inflammatory properties of ibuprofen appear to be particularly beneficial in aborting migraine attacks. Parents should be advised to administer it early in the attack and ensure adequate dosing based on the child's weight. This approach aligns with current UK paediatric headache management guidelines and provides effective symptom relief for most children with migraine.<br /><br /><b>Paracetamol</b> is commonly used for paediatric headaches and is generally safe, but evidence indicates it is less effective than ibuprofen specifically for migraine in children. Whilst it may provide some relief and could be considered if ibuprofen is contraindicated, it should not be the first-line choice when migraine is the likely diagnosis. Paracetamol may be more appropriate for tension-type headaches where the evidence base is less clear regarding superiority of NSAIDs.<br /><br /><b>Sumatriptan nasal spray</b> is a triptan that may be used in children aged 12 years and older, making it potentially appropriate for this 9-year-old patient from an age perspective. However, it is a second-line treatment reserved for cases where simple analgesia has failed. Additionally, sumatriptan nasal spray is poorly tolerated by young people due to the unpleasant taste it causes in the back of the throat. Triptans should only be initiated after discussion with a specialist and require appropriate follow-up.<br /><br /><b>Pizotifen</b> is a prophylactic medication used to prevent migraine attacks rather than treat acute episodes. It would be considered if this patient were experiencing frequent migraines (typically more than 2-3 per month) that significantly impact quality of life or school attendance. Prophylaxis is not indicated based on the current presentation of twice-monthly headaches, and pizotifen has no role in acute symptom management.<br /><br /><b>Propranolol</b> is another prophylactic agent used alongside pizotifen as first-line preventative treatment in paediatric migraine. Like pizotifen, it has no role in managing acute migraine episodes and would only be considered if the frequency and severity of attacks warranted preventative therapy. Propranolol requires careful monitoring and may have side-effects including fatigue and exercise intolerance, which could be particularly relevant in an active child.",

        "body": "A transient ischaemic attack (TIA), as the name suggests, is a brief period of neurological deficit due to a vascular cause, typically lasting less than an hour. The National Clinical Guideline for Stroke was published in 2023 and made a number of updated recommendations, including the use of dual antiplatelet therapy (DAPT). It should be noted that DAPT is not currently recommended for 'major' ischaemic stroke as the risk of haemorrhagic transformation is too high.<br /><br />The original definition of a TIA was time-based: a sudden onset of a focal neurologic symptom and/or sign lasting less than 24 hours, brought on by a transient decrease in blood flow. However, this has now changed as it is recognised that even short periods of ischaemia can result in pathological changes to the brain. Therefore, a new '<b>tissue-based'</b> definition is now used: <span class=\"concept\" data-cid=\"9800\">a transient episode of neurologic dysfunction caused by focal brain, spinal cord, or retinal ischaemia, without acute infarction.</span> <a href='https://radiopaedia.org/articles/transient-ischaemic-attack?lang=gb#:~:text=without%20acute%20infarction.-,Terminology,-In%20the%20past' title='Radiopaedia - Transient ischaemic attack' target='_blank' class='badge rounded-pill text-bg-light deeplink'>REF</a> <br /><br />Patients often use the term 'mini-stroke' for TIAs.<br /><br /><h5 class='notes-heading'>Clinical features</h5><br />The clinical features are similar to those of a stroke, i.e. sudden onset, focal neurological deficit but, rather than persisting, the features resolve, typically within 1 hour.<br /><br />Possible features include<br /><ul><li>unilateral weakness or sensory loss.</li><li>aphasia or dysarthria</li><li>ataxia, vertigo, or loss of balance</li><li>visual problems<ul><li>sudden transient loss of vision in one eye (amaurosis fugax)</li><li>diplopia</li><li>homonymous hemianopia</li></ul></li></ul><br /><h5 class='notes-heading'>Assessment and referral</h5><br />Patients with acute focal neurological symptoms that resolve completely within 24 hours of onset (i.e. suspected TIA) should:  <br /><ul><li>be given <span class=\"concept\" data-cid=\"12219\">aspirin 300 mg</span> immediately unless contraindicated </li><li>assessed urgently within 24 hours by a stroke specialist clinician</li></ul><br />Examples of TIA mimics that require exclusion<br /><ul><li><span class=\"concept\" data-cid=\"3993\">hypoglycaemia</span></li><li>intracranial haemorrhage<ul><li>all <span class=\"concept\" data-cid=\"4061\">patients on anticoagulants or with similar risk factors should be admitted for urgent imaging to exclude haemorrhage</span></li></ul></li></ul><br />If a patient presents more than 7 days ago they should be seen by a stroke specialist clinician as soon as possible within 7 days.<br /><br />The <span class=\"concept\" data-cid=\"1684\">ABCD2 prognostic score</span> has previously been used to risk stratify patients who present with a suspected TIA.
