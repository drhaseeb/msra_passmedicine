            "<b>Tremor</b> is the correct answer. A fine postural tremor is one of the most common side effects associated with lithium therapy, affecting a significant proportion of patients, particularly during the initial phase of treatment or following a dose increase. It is crucial to counsel patients about this possibility to manage their expectations and encourage adherence. The tremor is typically a high-frequency, low-amplitude tremor of the hands, which can be exacerbated by anxiety, caffeine, or voluntary action. It is important to differentiate this benign, dose-related tremor from the coarse, irregular tremor that can be a sign of impending lithium toxicity, which would also be accompanied by other features like ataxia, dysarthria, and confusion. Management of a fine tremor involves reassurance, considering a dose reduction if clinically appropriate and the lithium level allows, or dividing the daily dose. In persistent or bothersome cases, a beta-blocker such as propranolol may be prescribed. Counselling about this common side effect is a key part of safe prescribing of lithium.<br /><br /><b>Tinnitus</b> is an incorrect option. While tinnitus, the perception of sound in the absence of an external source, can be a side effect of various medications, it is not a recognised or common side effect of lithium. Drugs classically associated with ototoxicity and tinnitus include loop diuretics (like furosemide), aminoglycoside antibiotics (like gentamicin), and high-dose salicylates (aspirin). When counselling a patient starting lithium, the focus should be on common and clinically significant adverse effects. Mentioning tinnitus would be misleading and is not part of standard practice. If a patient on lithium develops tinnitus, other causes should be investigated rather than attributing it to the lithium itself.<br /><br /><b>Paraesthesia</b> is incorrect. Paraesthesia, an abnormal sensation such as tingling, pricking, or numbness ('pins and needles'), is not a typical side effect of lithium. It is more commonly associated with drug-induced peripheral neuropathy, which can be caused by medications such as isoniazid, metronidazole, or certain chemotherapy agents. It can also be a symptom of various underlying medical conditions, including vitamin B12 deficiency, diabetes mellitus, or nerve compression syndromes. Therefore, it would not be appropriate to counsel a patient that paraesthesia is a likely side effect of starting lithium. Its inclusion as an option serves as a plausible distractor representing a non-specific neurological symptom.<br /><br /><b>Photosensitivity</b> is an incorrect choice. Drug-induced photosensitivity is an adverse skin reaction to sunlight or ultraviolet radiation, but it is not a known side effect of lithium. This reaction is well-documented with other classes of medication, including tetracycline antibiotics, thiazide diuretics, amiodarone, and non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs). Patients taking these medications should be advised to use high-factor sun protection and avoid excessive sun exposure. As this is not an established risk with lithium, it would be inappropriate to include it in pre-treatment counselling, as it may cause unnecessary anxiety and is not evidence-based.<br /><br /><b>Dry eyes</b> is an incorrect option. While dry eyes (xerophthalmia) can be a side effect of medications, it is typically associated with drugs that have anticholinergic properties. These drugs block the action of acetylcholine, leading to reduced secretions from various glands, including the lacrimal glands. Examples include tricyclic antidepressants (e.g., amitriptyline), older antihistamines, and some antipsychotics. Lithium does not have significant anticholinergic activity and is not associated with causing dry eyes. The most relevant effects of lithium on fluid balance are polyuria and polydipsia due to its effect on the kidneys (nephrogenic diabetes insipidus), not on tear production. Therefore, this is not a side effect to counsel the patient about.",

            "The correct answer in this scenario is a <b>blood test for serology</b>. Lyme disease, caused by the spirochete <i>Borrelia burgdorferi</i>, is typically diagnosed through serological testing. This involves detecting antibodies against the organism in the patient's blood. The initial screening test is an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA), followed by a confirmatory Western blot if the ELISA is positive or equivocal. Serological testing can be highly sensitive and specific when performed several weeks after infection, as it takes time for the body to produce detectable levels of antibodies.<br /><br />A <b>skin biopsy</b> might be considered if there was suspicion of another skin condition, such as cutaneous lymphoma or granulomatous skin disorders. However, it is not the most appropriate investigation for Lyme disease, as serological testing provides more accurate results and is less invasive.<br /><br />A <b>test for urinary antigen</b> could be used to diagnose certain infections like Legionnaires' disease, but it is not applicable for diagnosing Lyme disease. Urinary antigen tests are generally not used for spirochetal infections like Lyme disease because they have low sensitivity and specificity compared to serological tests.<br /><br />A <b>blood culture</b> may be helpful in identifying bacterial infections in patients with sepsis or other systemic infections; however, it has limited utility in diagnosing Lyme disease. Blood cultures are often negative in cases of early Lyme disease due to the low number of circulating spirochetes. Additionally, <i>Borrelia burgdorferi</i> requires specialized culture media and conditions that are not routinely available in most laboratories.<br /><br />Lastly, a <b>sputum culture</b> would not be useful in this case as it is primarily used to identify respiratory pathogens causing pneumonia or bronchitis.

            "<b>Oral vancomycin</b> is the correct answer. This patient has developed a severe <i>Clostridioides difficile</i> infection (CDI), most likely precipitated by her recent treatment with a broad-spectrum cephalosporin. According to UK guidelines (NICE NG199), the severity of CDI is assessed using clinical and laboratory markers. This patient meets the criteria for a severe infection based on both her white cell count (WCC) being >15 x 10<sup>9</sup>/L and having an acute kidney injury, with a creatinine rise of more than 50% from her baseline (a 61% increase). For any first episode of CDI, whether non-severe or severe, the recommended first-line antibiotic treatment is a 10-day course of oral vancomycin. It is crucial that vancomycin is given orally, as it is poorly absorbed and therefore achieves high concentrations within the colonic lumen where the infection is located. The precipitating antibiotic (ceftriaxone) should also be reviewed and stopped if clinically appropriate.<br /><br /><b>Oral metronidazole</b> is an incorrect choice. While historically used as a first-line agent for non-severe CDI, UK guidelines were updated due to evidence demonstrating its inferiority to oral vancomycin. Multiple studies and meta-analyses have shown that oral vancomycin is associated with higher clinical cure rates and a lower risk of treatment failure compared to metronidazole, particularly in cases of severe infection. Its use is now generally reserved for situations where oral vancomycin or fidaxomicin are unavailable or contraindicated, or as part of combination therapy with oral vancomycin for life-threatening CDI. Choosing this option would represent outdated clinical knowledge.<br /><br /><b>Oral fidaxomicin</b> is an incorrect choice for this initial presentation. Fidaxomicin is a narrow-spectrum macrocyclic antibiotic with excellent activity against <i>C. difficile</i>. While it is a highly effective treatment, its place in the treatment algorithm is specific. According to NICE guidelines, it is recommended as a second-line option if oral vancomycin is unsuitable for a first episode. Its primary role is in managing recurrent CDI, where it is recommended as a first-line agent for an episode occurring within 12 weeks of the previous one. Given its higher cost, its use is reserved for specific circumstances to ensure cost-effective practice, making vancomycin the most appropriate initial choice here.<br /><br /><b>Intravenous vancomycin</b> is an incorrect and potentially harmful choice. This is a classic pitfall in questions regarding CDI management. Vancomycin is a large glycopeptide antibiotic that, when administered intravenously, does not achieve significant concentrations in the gastrointestinal tract lumen. It is excreted renally and has poor penetration into the colon. Therefore, IV vancomycin is completely ineffective for treating CDI. It is, however, the treatment of choice for systemic Gram-positive infections like MRSA bacteraemia. The distinction between the oral and intravenous routes for treating different infections is a critical piece of pharmacological knowledge.<br /><br /><b>Intravenous metronidazole</b> is incorrect as a sole agent in this scenario. While IV metronidazole does have a role in managing CDI, it is reserved for the most severe, life-threatening cases. Life-threatening CDI is defined by the presence of hypotension, ileus, or toxic megacolon. In such situations, IV metronidazole is given in combination with oral vancomycin (which may need to be administered via a nasogastric tube or as a retention enema if an ileus is present). This patient's laboratory results indicate a severe infection, but there is no information in the vignette to suggest she has life-threatening complications. Therefore, initiating IV metronidazole is not the most appropriate next step.",
