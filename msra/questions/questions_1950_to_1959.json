            "The correct answer is <b>Inverted + plantar flexed foot which is not passively correctable</b>. Clubfoot, also known as talipes equinovarus, is a congenital deformity that is characterised by the foot being turned inwards (inverted) and downwards (plantar flexed). The key feature of this condition is that the foot cannot be easily or fully corrected into a neutral position passively - this means without active movement from the patient. This condition often requires treatment with methods such as the Ponseti method, which involves gentle manipulation and casting of the foot over several weeks to gradually correct its position.<br /><br />Option <b>Inverted + dorsiflexed foot + pes planus which is not passively correctable</b> incorrectly describes clubfoot because it includes dorsiflexion of the foot, which means that the toes are pointed upwards towards the shin. This is not a characteristic of clubfoot. Pes planus, also known as flat foot, is not typically associated with clubfoot.<br /><br />Similarly, option <b>Inverted + plantar flexed foot + pes planus which is passively correctable</b> inaccurately describes clubfoot due to its mention of pes planus and its passive correctability. As previously mentioned, clubfoot involves an inversion and plantar flexion that cannot be corrected passively.<br /><br />Option <b>Everted + dorsiflexed foot which is not passively correctable</b> mischaracterises clubfoot by suggesting that the foot turns outwards (eversion) and upwards (dorsiflexion). In fact, clubfoot involves an inward turning of the foot.<br /><br />Lastly, option <b>Inverted + plantar flexed foot which is passively correctable</b> could be misleading because while it correctly identifies two features of clubfoot - inversion and plantar flexion - it incorrectly suggests that these can be corrected passively. In reality, true cases of clubfoot require more intervention for correction than simple passive manoeuvres.",

The new guidelines represent a major step change in the management of asthma is both diagnosed and treated.<br /><br />For many years patients with asthma were started on a short-acting beta-2 agonist (SABA) inhaler before 'stepping up' to a regular inhaled corticosteroid with a SABA as required. The new guidelines now advocate the use of combined inhalers (ICS + long-acting beta-2 agonist) as reliever therapy or regularly, depending on the severity of asthma. Given the prevalence of asthma, it is likely that doctors will have to deal with patients on 'conventional' asthma treatments for many years to come. The joint guidelines therefore include guidance on how to manage these patients if their current treatment is controlling their symptoms sufficiently.<br /><br /><h5 class='notes-heading'>Management of adult patients aged children aged \u2265 12 years with newly diagnosed asthma</h5><br />Step 1 <a href='https://www.nice.org.uk/guidance/ng245/chapter/Recommendations#pharmacological-management-in-people-aged-12-and-over:~:text=and%20over.-,Initial%20management%20of%20newly%20diagnosed%20asthma%20in%20people%20aged%2012%20and%20over,-1.7.1' title='NICE - 2024 Asthma: diagnosis, monitoring and chronic asthma management (BTS, NICE, SIGN)' target='_blank' class='badge rounded-pill text-bg-light deeplink'>NICE</a><ul><li>a <span class=\"concept\" data-cid=\"12286\">low-dose inhaled corticosteroid (ICS)/formoterol combination inhaler to be taken as needed for symptom relief</span><ul><li>this is termed anti-inflammatory reliever (AIR) therapy</li></ul></li><li>if the patient presents highly symptomatic (for example, regular nocturnal waking) or with a severe exacerbation:<ul><li><span class=\"concept\" data-cid=\"12295\">start treatment with low-dose MART</span> (maintenance and reliever therapy, see below)</li><li>treat the acute symptoms as appropriate (e.g. a course of oral corticosteroids may be indicated)</li></ul></li></ul><br />Step 2  <a href='https://www.nice.org.uk/guidance/ng245/chapter/Recommendations#pharmacological-management-in-people-aged-12-and-over:~:text=asthma%20management.-,Medicine%20combination%20and%20sequencing%20in%20people%20aged%2012%20and%20over,-For%20guidance%20on' title='NICE - 2024 Asthma: diagnosis, monitoring and chronic asthma management (BTS, NICE, SIGN)' target='_blank' class='badge rounded-pill text-bg-light deeplink'>NICE</a> <br /><ul><li><span class=\"concept\" data-cid=\"12287\">a low-dose MART</span><ul><li>MART describes using an inhaled corticosteroid (ICS)/formoterol combination inhaler for daily maintenance therapy and the relief of symptoms as needed, i.e. regularly and as required</li></ul></li></ul><br />Step 3<br /><ul><li>a <span class=\"concept\" data-cid=\"12288\">moderate-dose MART</span></li></ul><br />Step 4<br /><ul><li><span class=\"concept\" data-cid=\"12289\">check the fractional exhaled nitric oxide (FeNO) level if available, and the blood eosinophil count</span>  <a href='https://www.nice.org.uk/guidance/ng245/chapter/Recommendations#pharmacological-management-in-people-aged-12-and-over:~:text=Check%20the%20fractional%20exhaled%20nitric%20oxide%20(FeNO)%20level%20if%20available' title='NICE - 2024 Asthma: diagnosis, monitoring and chronic asthma management (BTS, NICE, SIGN)' target='_blank' class='badge rounded-pill text-bg-light deeplink'>NICE</a> <ul><li>if <span class=\"concept\" data-cid=\"12290\">either of these is raised, refer to a specialist in asthma care</span></li><li>if <span class=\"concept\" data-cid=\"12291\">neither FeNO nor eosinophil count is raised, consider a trial of either a leukotriene receptor antagonist (LTRA) or a long-acting muscarinic receptor antagonist (LAMA)</span> used in addition to moderate-dose MART</li><li>if control has not improved, stop the LTRA or LAMA and start a trial of the alternative medicine (LTRA or LAMA)</li></ul></li></ul><br />Step 5<br /><ul><li><span class=\"concept\" data-cid=\"12292\">refer people to a specialist in asthma care</span> when asthma is not controlled despite treatment with moderate-dose MART, and trials of an LTRA and a LAMA</li></ul><br /><div class=\"container\"><div class=\"row\"><div class=\"col-md-3\"><a href=\"https://d32xxyeh8kfs8k.cloudfront.net/images_Passmedicine/pdd602b.png\" data-fancybox=\"gallery\" data-caption=\"Algorithm showing pharmacological management of asthma in people aged 12 years and over\"><img  class=\"img-thumbnail mx-auto d-block\" style=\"max-height:150px;margin-bottom:10px;\" src=\"https://d32xxyeh8kfs8k.cloudfront.net/images_Passmedicine/pdd602.png\" alt=\"\" /></a></div></div></div><br /><h5 class='notes-heading'>Transferring people aged 12 and over from other treatment pathways</h5><br />There will be many people whose asthma was managed according to the previous guidelines that present with uncontrolled asthmatic symptoms.

            "<b>Ramsay Hunt syndrome</b> is the correct diagnosis based on the clinical presentation. This condition is caused by reactivation of the varicella-zoster virus (the same virus that causes chickenpox) in the geniculate ganglion of the facial nerve. The classic triad includes facial nerve palsy, ear pain, and vesicular eruptions on the ear or in the ear canal. In this case, James presents with weakness of the right side of his face (facial nerve palsy), ear pain, and vesicles visible on otoscopy of the tympanic membrane. These findings are pathognomonic for Ramsay Hunt syndrome. Early diagnosis is crucial as prompt treatment with antivirals (aciclovir) and corticosteroids within 72 hours of symptom onset significantly improves outcomes. Without treatment, patients may experience permanent facial weakness and other complications such as hearing loss or vertigo. The prognosis for facial nerve recovery is generally worse than in Bell's palsy.<br /><br /><b>Malignant otitis externa</b> is an aggressive infection of the external auditory canal that can spread to adjacent tissues including bone. It typically affects elderly diabetic or immunocompromised patients and is most commonly caused by Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Patients present with severe otalgia, otorrhoea, and granulation tissue in the ear canal, but facial nerve palsy is a late finding that occurs when the infection has spread significantly. The absence of purulent discharge, granulation tissue, and the presence of vesicles make this diagnosis unlikely in James's case.<br /><br /><b>Acoustic neuroma</b> (vestibular schwannoma) is a benign tumour arising from the Schwann cells of the vestibular portion of the eighth cranial nerve. It typically presents with progressive unilateral sensorineural hearing loss, tinnitus, and balance disturbances. Facial weakness is a late manifestation that occurs when the tumour is large enough to compress the adjacent facial nerve. The acute onset of symptoms, presence of vesicles, and ear pain are inconsistent with acoustic neuroma, making this diagnosis incorrect for James.<br /><br /><b>Cholesteatoma</b> is an abnormal growth of keratinising squamous epithelium in the middle ear or mastoid. It typically presents with chronic, foul-smelling otorrhoea, conductive hearing loss, and a whitish mass visible behind the tympanic membrane. While facial nerve palsy can occur in advanced cases due to erosion of the facial canal, the acute presentation, ear pain, and vesicular eruptions seen in James are not typical features of cholesteatoma, ruling out this diagnosis.<br /><br /><b>Herpes simplex otitis</b> refers to herpes simplex virus (HSV) infection of the ear. While HSV can cause vesicular eruptions similar to those seen in Ramsay Hunt syndrome, it rarely causes facial nerve palsy. HSV typically causes smaller, grouped vesicles that may involve the external ear canal but rarely affect the tympanic membrane itself. The combination of facial weakness with vesicles on the tympanic membrane is much more consistent with varicella-zoster virus reactivation (Ramsay Hunt syndrome) than with HSV infection. Additionally, HSV otitis is not typically associated with the degree of pain and neurological involvement seen in this case.",
