        "body": "Under normal conditions, clotting and clot breakdown are balanced. Thrombin converts fibrinogen into fibrin to form a stable clot, while the fibrinolytic system generates plasmin to break down fibrin and fibrinogen into fibrin degradation products. Plasmin is central to maintaining this balance.<br /><br />In disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC), this balance is lost, leading to widespread clotting and bleeding. The key trigger is tissue factor (TF), a membrane protein normally hidden from circulation but exposed after vascular injury or in response to cytokines (e.g. IL-1, TNF) and endotoxin, particularly in sepsis. TF is abundant in lung, brain, and placenta, explaining the risk in trauma and obstetric cases.

            "The correct answer is <b>start metformin, up-titrate; introduce dapagliflozin once metformin tolerance is confirmed</b>.<br /><br />This question presents a challenge due to updates in the NICE guidelines. The crucial concept to understand is the importance of managing cardiovascular risk in this patient, which has been shown to improve with SGLT2 inhibitors in numerous trials. Given that the patient has a high QRISK score (> 10%) and a history of heart failure, prescribing dapagliflozin alongside metformin as first-line therapy is indicated. NICE also recommend this approach for all patients with type 2 diabetes who have a history of ischaemic heart disease, peripheral arterial disease or an ischaemic stroke.<br /><br />To clarify, dapagliflozin's role here extends beyond its glycaemic effects; it is primarily being introduced to manage cardiovascular risk. Therefore, initiation of dapagliflozin should proceed regardless of the patient's HbA1c levels. Alternative SGLT2 inhibitors that have demonstrated cardiovascular benefits include empagliflozin, canagliflozin, and ertugliflozin, with dapagliflozin often being favoured for its cost-effectiveness, but any can be used as first line.<br /><br />Directly referencing NICE guidelines: 'When initiating dual therapy with metformin and an SGLT2 inhibitor as first-line treatment in adults with type 2 diabetes, introduce the medications sequentially'beginning with metformin to assess tolerability before starting an SGLT2 inhibitor.' For metformin initiation: 'Gradually increase the dose over several weeks to reduce gastrointestinal side effects' (see points 1.7.6 and 1.7.7 in the guidelines).

        "question": "A 50-year-old man presents to the clinic with a new diagnosis of type 2 diabetes.<br /><br />His past medical history includes obesity, hypertension and heart failure. He has a QRISK score of 14%.<br /><br />His HbA1c was measured at 54 mmol/mol last week, and his eGFR is > 90. You decide to initiate antidiabetic medication and schedule a review in three months, during which you intend to re-evaluate his HbA1c levels.<br /><br />What is the most appropriate management plan for this patient?",
        "correct_answer": "4",
        "question_notes": "The correct answer is <b>start metformin, up-titrate; introduce dapagliflozin once metformin tolerance is confirmed</b>.<br /><br />This question presents a challenge due to updates in the NICE guidelines. The crucial concept to understand is the importance of managing cardiovascular risk in this patient, which has been shown to improve with SGLT2 inhibitors in numerous trials. Given that the patient has a high QRISK score (> 10%) and a history of heart failure, prescribing dapagliflozin alongside metformin as first-line therapy is indicated. NICE also recommend this approach for all patients with type 2 diabetes who have a history of ischaemic heart disease, peripheral arterial disease or an ischaemic stroke.<br /><br />To clarify, dapagliflozin's role here extends beyond its glycaemic effects; it is primarily being introduced to manage cardiovascular risk. Therefore, initiation of dapagliflozin should proceed regardless of the patient's HbA1c levels. Alternative SGLT2 inhibitors that have demonstrated cardiovascular benefits include empagliflozin, canagliflozin, and ertugliflozin, with dapagliflozin often being favoured for its cost-effectiveness, but any can be used as first line.<br /><br />Directly referencing NICE guidelines: 'When initiating dual therapy with metformin and an SGLT2 inhibitor as first-line treatment in adults with type 2 diabetes, introduce the medications sequentially'beginning with metformin to assess tolerability before starting an SGLT2 inhibitor.'

An ambulance is called.<br /><br />The birthday girl's symptoms immediately improve but she remains breathless and unwell. Her friend recalls that she can use a second Epipen\u00b5.<br /><br />When can the adrenaline be re-administered?",

        "question_notes": "In treating anaphylaxis, adrenaline can be repeated every <b>5 minutes</b>. This is the correct answer.<br /><br />The other answers are incorrect. Patients with a history of anaphylaxis are advised to take two auto-injectors around with them at all times, in case they require a second dose.",

            "<b>Pancreatic cancer</b> is most strongly associated with raised levels of CA 19-9, making this the correct answer. CA 19-9 (carbohydrate antigen 19-9) is a tumour marker that is primarily elevated in pancreatic adenocarcinoma, with approximately 70-80% of patients with pancreatic cancer demonstrating elevated levels. It is considered the most useful serum biomarker for pancreatic cancer and is commonly used in clinical practice for diagnosis, monitoring treatment response, and surveillance for recurrence. However, it's important to note that CA 19-9 is not specific to pancreatic cancer and can be elevated in other conditions, particularly biliary obstruction. Additionally, approximately 5-10% of the population cannot synthesise CA 19-9 due to Lewis antigen negativity, resulting in false negatives even in the presence of pancreatic cancer.<br /><br /><b>Breast cancer</b> is not typically associated with elevated CA 19-9 levels. The primary tumour markers used in breast cancer are CA 15-3, carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA), and more recently, circulating tumour cells and circulating tumour DNA. While CA 19-9 may occasionally be elevated in advanced breast cancer, it is not a sensitive or specific marker for this malignancy and is not routinely measured in breast cancer patients.<br /><br /><b>Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC)</b> is primarily associated with elevated alpha-fetoprotein (AFP) levels rather than CA 19-9. AFP is elevated in approximately 70% of HCC cases and is the standard tumour marker used for screening and monitoring this cancer. While CA 19-9 may be elevated in some cases of HCC, particularly those with a cholangiocarcinoma component, it is not the characteristic tumour marker for this malignancy.<br /><br /><b>Ovarian cancer</b> is most commonly associated with elevated CA 125 levels, not CA 19-9. CA 125 is elevated in approximately 80% of epithelial ovarian cancers and is the standard tumour marker used for monitoring treatment response and detecting recurrence. While CA 19-9 may be elevated in some mucinous ovarian tumours, it is not the primary tumour marker used in ovarian cancer diagnosis or management.<br /><br /><b>Colorectal cancer</b> is primarily associated with elevated carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) levels rather than CA 19-9. CEA is the standard tumour marker used for monitoring treatment response and surveillance in colorectal cancer. While CA 19-9 may be elevated in some cases of colorectal cancer, particularly those with liver metastases, it is not routinely measured in colorectal cancer patients and is not the characteristic tumour marker for this malignancy.",
