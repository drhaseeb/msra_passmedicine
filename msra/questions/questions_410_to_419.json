            "<b>IV propranolol</b> is the correct answer as beta-blockers are the most important first-line treatment for addressing the cardiovascular manifestations of thyroid storm. Propranolol works by blocking the peripheral effects of excess thyroid hormone, providing rapid symptomatic relief from tachycardia, hypertension, and other adrenergic symptoms. The cardiovascular effects of thyroid storm can be life-threatening, leading to heart failure and arrhythmias, making immediate beta-blockade crucial. Propranolol is preferred over other beta-blockers as it also has some anti-thyroid properties and crosses the blood-brain barrier, helping with central nervous system symptoms. IV administration ensures rapid onset of action in this emergency situation.<br /><br /><b>IV hydrocortisone</b> is an important component of thyroid storm management but is not the first-line treatment for cardiovascular manifestations. Corticosteroids work by reducing peripheral conversion of T4 to T3 and may help with the underlying inflammatory response. However, their onset of action is slower than beta-blockers, and they do not directly address the immediate cardiovascular crisis that characterises thyroid storm.<br /><br /><b>Oral methimazole</b> is crucial for long-term management as it blocks new thyroid hormone synthesis by inhibiting thyroid peroxidase. However, it does not address the immediate cardiovascular emergency as it takes time to deplete existing hormone stores. In thyroid storm, the priority is managing the effects of circulating hormone rather than preventing new synthesis alone.<br /><br /><b>Lugol's iodine solution</b> prevents further thyroid hormone release through the Wolff-Chaikoff effect but should typically be given after antithyroid drugs to prevent initial stimulation of hormone synthesis. It does not directly address cardiovascular manifestations and is not considered first-line for the immediate management of the cardiovascular crisis.<br /><br /><b>IV paracetamol</b> is important for symptomatic treatment of fever in thyroid storm, but it does not address the life-threatening cardiovascular manifestations. While fever management is necessary, the immediate priority is controlling the dangerous tachycardia and hypertension that can lead to cardiac complications.",

            "The correct answer is <b>Albumin</b>. Albumin is a protein made by the liver and its levels in the blood are often used as an indicator of nutritional status and liver function. In acute inflammation or infection, albumin levels may actually decrease due to increased capillary permeability, leading to leakage of albumin into the interstitial space. Additionally, there may be reduced synthesis as the liver diverts resources towards producing acute phase proteins. Therefore, unlike other markers of inflammation or infection, albumin would not normally be raised.<br /><br /><b>CRP (C-reactive protein)</b> is an incorrect option because it's an acute phase reactant that increases rapidly in response to inflammation or infection. CRP is produced by the liver and its level can rise significantly within just a few hours of an acute inflammatory stimulus.<br /><br /><b>Platelets</b>, also known as thrombocytes, are another incorrect option. Platelets play a vital role in haemostasis but their count can increase during periods of inflammation or infection; this is known as reactive thrombocytosis.<br /><br /><b>ESR (Erythrocyte Sedimentation Rate)</b> is also incorrect as it's another non-specific marker of inflammation. It measures the rate at which red blood cells sediment in a period of one hour. In inflammatory conditions, including infections, the ESR can be elevated.<br /><br />Finally, <b>Ferritin</b> is another incorrect choice since it's an intracellular protein that stores iron and releases it in a controlled fashion. During periods of inflammation or infection, ferritin levels can increase due to its role as an acute phase reactant and because it helps to sequester iron away from pathogens.<br />",

Therefore, unlike other markers of inflammation or infection, albumin would not normally be raised.<br /><br /><b>CRP (C-reactive protein)</b> is an incorrect option because it's an acute phase reactant that increases rapidly in response to inflammation or infection. CRP is produced by the liver and its level can rise significantly within just a few hours of an acute inflammatory stimulus.<br /><br /><b>Platelets</b>, also known as thrombocytes, are another incorrect option. Platelets play a vital role in haemostasis but their count can increase during periods of inflammation or infection; this is known as reactive thrombocytosis.<br /><br /><b>ESR (Erythrocyte Sedimentation Rate)</b> is also incorrect as it's another non-specific marker of inflammation. It measures the rate at which red blood cells sediment in a period of one hour. In inflammatory conditions, including infections, the ESR can be elevated.<br /><br />Finally, <b>Ferritin</b> is another incorrect choice since it's an intracellular protein that stores iron and releases it in a controlled fashion. During periods of inflammation or infection, ferritin levels can increase due to its role as an acute phase reactant and because it helps to sequester iron away from pathogens.<br />",

CRP is a protein synthesised in the liver and binds to phosphocholine in bacterial cells and on those cells undergoing apoptosis. In binding to these cells it is then able to activate the complement system. CRP levels are known to rise in patients following surgery. However, levels of greater than 150 at 48 hours post operatively are suggestive of evolving complications.<br /><br />**plays a more significant role in other mammals such as mice",

            "The correct answer is <b>Afro-Caribbean ethnicity</b>. Post-partum haemorrhage (PPH) refers to a blood loss of 500 ml or more within 24 hours after birth. The risk factors for PPH are multifactorial and include obstetric, maternal, and fetal factors. However, Afro-Caribbean ethnicity is not recognised as a risk factor for PPH.<br /><br /><b>Macrosomia</b> is considered a risk factor for primary post-partum haemorrhage. Macrosomia refers to a newborn with an excessive birth weight, typically defined as a birth weight greater than 4000 to 4500 grams. The increased size of the baby can lead to prolonged labour and increased uterine atony following delivery, both of which increase the risk of PPH.<br /><br /><b>Pre-eclampsia</b> is another recognised risk factor for primary post-partum haemorrhage. Pre-eclampsia is a pregnancy complication characterised by high blood pressure and signs of damage to another organ system, most often the liver and kidneys. Women with pre-eclampsia have an increased risk of abnormal placentation, which can lead to placental abruption or retained placenta - both conditions associated with an increased risk of PPH.<br /><br /><b>Prolonged labour</b>, also known as failure to progress in labour, increases the risk of primary post-partum haemorrhage because it can lead to uterine atony. Uterine atony refers to a lack of normal muscle contraction in the uterus after childbirth, leading to continued bleeding from the site where the placenta was attached.<br /><br />Lastly, <b>Polyhydramnios</b>, which means excessive amniotic fluid around the fetus during pregnancy, increases the likelihood of postpartum hemorrhage due to overdistension of the uterus leading again to uterine atony after delivery.<br />",

Macrosomia refers to a newborn with an excessive birth weight, typically defined as a birth weight greater than 4000 to 4500 grams. The increased size of the baby can lead to prolonged labour and increased uterine atony following delivery, both of which increase the risk of PPH.<br /><br /><b>Pre-eclampsia</b> is another recognised risk factor for primary post-partum haemorrhage. Pre-eclampsia is a pregnancy complication characterised by high blood pressure and signs of damage to another organ system, most often the liver and kidneys. Women with pre-eclampsia have an increased risk of abnormal placentation, which can lead to placental abruption or retained placenta - both conditions associated with an increased risk of PPH.<br /><br /><b>Prolonged labour</b>, also known as failure to progress in labour, increases the risk of primary post-partum haemorrhage because it can lead to uterine atony. Uterine atony refers to a lack of normal muscle contraction in the uterus after childbirth, leading to continued bleeding from the site where the placenta was attached.<br /><br />Lastly, <b>Polyhydramnios</b>, which means excessive amniotic fluid around the fetus during pregnancy, increases the likelihood of postpartum hemorrhage due to overdistension of the uterus leading again to uterine atony after delivery.<br />",
