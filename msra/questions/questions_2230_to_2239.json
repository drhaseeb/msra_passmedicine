            "The correct answer in this case is <b>splenic rupture</b>. The patient's presentation of fatigue, sore throat, fever, cervical lymphadenopathy, and palatal petechiae are suggestive of infectious mononucleosis (IM), which is most commonly caused by the Epstein-Barr virus (EBV). One of the potential complications of IM is splenomegaly, which increases the risk of splenic rupture. Splenic rupture is a rare but serious complication that can lead to life-threatening haemorrhage. Patients with IM should be advised to avoid contact sports or activities that could cause abdominal trauma until their spleen size returns to normal.<br /><br />The other options are incorrect for the following reasons:<br /><br /><b>Subacute sclerosing panencephalitis</b> is a rare and fatal complication of measles infection (<i>Measles morbillivirus</i>). It usually presents several years after the initial measles infection and causes progressive neurological deterioration. This option is not relevant to the patient's likely diagnosis of IM due to EBV.<br /><br /><b>Iron-deficiency anaemia</b> would not typically be a direct complication of infectious mononucleosis. While some patients with IM may experience mild anaemia due to bone marrow suppression or haemolysis, it would not typically present as iron-deficiency anaemia.<br /><br /><b>Encephalitis</b>, although a potential central nervous system complication of various viral infections, is not a common complication associated specifically with infectious mononucleosis caused by EBV. Encephalitis more commonly occurs in infections such as herpes simplex virus (HSV) and arboviruses.<br /><br /><b>Giant cell pneumonia</b>, also known as Hecht's pneumonia, is a severe form of interstitial pneumonia characterized by multinucleated giant cells.

            "The correct answer is <b>Migraine with aura</b>. According to the UK Medical Eligibility Criteria (UKMEC), migraine with aura is an absolute contraindication to combined oral contraceptive pill use due to the increased risk of stroke. The presence of aura in migraines is a significant risk factor for ischemic stroke, and when combined with the prothrombotic effect of oestrogen found in combined oral contraceptives, this risk is further amplified.<br /><br /><b>Concurrent use of St John's Wort</b> is not an absolute contraindication but it should be noted that St John's Wort can reduce the effectiveness of hormonal contraceptives including the combined pill. It does this by inducing liver enzymes which increase the metabolism of ethinylestradiol and progestogens. This may lead to breakthrough bleeding and/or contraceptive failure. Therefore, alternative or additional contraception methods are advised for users of St John's Wort.<br /><br /><b>Family history of thromboembolic disease in first degree relatives < 45 years</b> alone does not constitute an absolute contraindication to combined oral contraceptive use. However, if there are other personal risk factors such as obesity, smoking or immobilisation then a progestogen-only method or non-hormonal method may be more appropriate.<br /><br />As for <b>Immobility (e.g. wheelchair use)</b>, it increases the risk of venous thromboembolism but it is not considered as an absolute contraindication for using COCP according to UKMEC guidelines. The decision should be individualised taking into account other potential risk factors.<br /><br />Finally, <b>Diabetes mellitus (diagnosed 11 years ago)</b> isn't an absolute contraindication either unless it is associated with vascular complications or other severe comorbidities such as nephropathy, retinopathy or neuropathy. In these cases, alternative methods should be considered due to increased cardiovascular risks associated with oestrogen-containing contraceptives.<br />",
