According to SIGN guidelines, patients with clinical signs of superficial thrombophlebitis affecting the proximal long saphenous vein should have an ultrasound scan to exclude concurrent deep vein thrombosis (DVT). This is because approximately 20% of patients with superficial thrombophlebitis will have an underlying DVT at presentation. The patient's presentation with a tender, firm, erythematous cord-like structure along the medial thigh is classic for superficial thrombophlebitis. The length of affected vein (7cm) is significant, as inflammation extending over 5cm is associated with a higher risk of concurrent or subsequent DVT. Additionally, her risk factors for thrombosis include obesity and combined oral contraceptive use. Ultrasound will confirm the diagnosis of superficial thrombophlebitis and, crucially, rule out extension into the deep venous system, which would require different management.<br /><br /><b>D-dimer blood test</b> is not the appropriate first-line investigation in this scenario. While D-dimer testing can be useful in ruling out DVT in low-probability patients, this patient has clear clinical signs of superficial thrombophlebitis, which warrants direct imaging. D-dimer levels would likely be elevated due to the thrombophlebitis itself, regardless of whether there is concurrent DVT, making the test less useful for clinical decision-making in this context. Additionally, a negative D-dimer would not obviate the need for ultrasound imaging given the high clinical suspicion for superficial thrombophlebitis.<br /><br /><b>Blood cultures</b> would be appropriate if there were signs of septic thrombophlebitis or systemic infection.

        "title": "Superficial thrombophlebitis",
        "body": "Superficial thrombophlebitis, as the name suggests describes the inflammation associated with thrombosis of one of the superficial veins, usually the long saphenous vein of the leg. This process is usually non-infective in nature but secondary bacterial infection may rarely occur resulting in septic thrombophlebitis. <br /><br />Around 20% with superficial thrombophlebitis will have an underlying deep vein thrombosis (DVT) at presentation and 3-4% of patients will progress to a DVT if untreated. The risk of DVT is partly linked to the length of vein affected - an inflammed vein > 5 cm is more likely to have an associated DVT.<br /><br /><h5 class='notes-heading'>Management</h5><br />There are currently a variety of treatment approaches to superficial thrombophlebitis. Traditionally NSAIDs have been used, with topical NSAIDs for limited and mild disease and oral NSAIDs for more severe disease.<br /><br />Topical heparinoids have also be used in the management of superficial thrombophlebitis.<br /><br />A Cochrane review however found topical NSAIDs and heparinoids have no significant benefit in terms of reducing extension or progression to DVT. Oral NSAIDs were however shown to reduce the risk of extension by 67%.<br /><br /><span class=\"concept\" data-cid=\"11212\">Compression stockings</span> are also used. Remember that the ankle-brachial pressure index (ABPI) should be measured before prescribing compression stockings, particularly if using class 2 or above stockings. <br /><br />One of the major changes to the management of superficial thrombophlebitis is the increased use of low-molecular weight heparin. This has been shown to reduce extension and transformation to DVT. SIGN produced guidelines in 2010:<br /><br /><div class='bs-callout bs-callout-default'><i><i><br />Patients with clinical signs of superficial thrombophlebitis affecting the proximal long saphenous vein should have an <span class=\"concept\" data-cid=\"566\">ultrasound scan to exclude concurrent DVT</span>.<br /><ul><li>Patients with superficial thrombophlebitis should have anti-embolism stockings and can be considered for treatment with prophylactic doses of LMWH for up to 30 days or fondaparinux for 45 days.</li><li>If LMWH is contraindicated, 8-12 days of oral NSAIDS should be offered.</li></ul><br />Patients with superficial thrombophlebitis at, or extending towards, the sapheno-femoral junction can be considered for therapeutic anticoagulation for 6-12 weeks.<br /></i></i></div><br />This may be a significant departure from our current practice - the majority of patients with superficial thrombophlebitis (i.e. those affecting the long saphenous vein) should be referred for an ultrasound scan.",

            "The correct answer is <b>Intraventricular haemorrhage</b>. Intraventricular haemorrhage (IVH) is the most likely cause of worsening neurological function in a premature infant born at 34 weeks gestation. IVH occurs when there is bleeding into the ventricular system of the brain, which is more common in premature infants due to the fragility of their blood vessels. The immature germinal matrix in preterm infants has an increased risk of rupture and bleeding, leading to IVH. This can result in various neurological complications such as hydrocephalus, cerebral palsy, and developmental delays.<br /><br />The first incorrect option is <b>Extra dural haemorrhage</b>. Extradural haemorrhage, also known as epidural haemorrhage, refers to bleeding between the dura mater and skull. This type of bleeding typically results from a traumatic injury or skull fracture and would not be expected in a newborn without any history of trauma.<br /><br />The second incorrect option is <b>Sub dural haemorrhage</b>. Subdural haemorrhage involves bleeding between the dura mater and arachnoid mater layers of the meninges. While subdural haematoma can occur in neonates due to birth trauma or hypoxic-ischemic events, it is less likely than IVH in this scenario given that the infant initially appeared stable.<br /><br />The third incorrect option is <b>Sub arachnoid haemorrhage</b>. Subarachnoid haemorrhage refers to bleeding into the subarachnoid space surrounding the brain. This condition usually results from aneurysm rupture or head injury and would be unlikely in a newborn without any history of trauma or predisposing factors.<br /><br />Finally, the last incorrect option is <b>Arteriovenous malformation</b>. Arteriovenous malformations (AVMs) are abnormal connections between arteries and veins, typically congenital in nature. While AVMs can cause neurological symptoms due to haemorrhage or mass effect, they would be an uncommon cause of neurological decline in a premature infant without any other signs or symptoms suggestive of an AVM.",

            "The most appropriate first-line treatment for this patient with suspected post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) is <b>cognitive behavioural therapy or eye movement desensitisation and reprocessing therapy</b>. According to the UK guidelines, both cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT) and eye movement desensitisation and reprocessing (EMDR) are recommended as first-line treatments for PTSD.

However, she should also use additional contraception, such as condoms, for the next 2 days (48 hours) because the efficacy of the POP may have been compromised.<br /><br />The option <b>Take missed pill as soon as possible and omit pill break at end of pack</b> is incorrect because there is no 'pill break' or '7-day free interval' with POPs like there is with combined oral contraceptives. Progestogen-only pills are taken continuously without a break.<br /><br /><b>Perform a pregnancy test</b> is not necessary at this stage. This advice would be relevant if two or more pills were missed consecutively and unprotected intercourse occurred during that time period, or if there was another reason to suspect pregnancy such as missing a period.<br /><br />The option <b>Take missed pill as soon as possible and no further action needed</b> is incorrect because although it's important to take the missed pill ASAP, additional contraceptive protection is recommended when the progestogen-only pill has been taken more than 3 hours late.<br /><br />Finally, offering <b>Emergency contraception should be offered</b> would only be appropriate if unprotected sexual intercourse had occurred after missing the pill and before normal pill-taking had been re-established for at least 48 hours.

            "The correct answer is <b>Methotrexate</b>, which is a disease-modifying antirheumatic drug (DMARD) commonly used in rheumatoid arthritis. Methotrexate can cause pneumonitis, an interstitial lung disease characterised by inflammation and fibrosis of the lung parenchyma. This presents with dyspnoea, reduced oxygen saturations, and restrictive pattern on spirometry with reduced transfer factor (DLCO). The condition occurs in approximately 0.3-8% of patients taking methotrexate and can develop at any time during treatment. Recognition and discontinuation of methotrexate is essential in managing this potentially serious adverse effect.<br /><br /><b>Depomederone</b> (depot methylprednisolone) is a long-acting corticosteroid. While it can have numerous side effects, it does not typically cause interstitial lung disease or a restrictive pattern on spirometry. In fact, it is often used therapeutically in inflammatory lung conditions.<br /><br /><b>Hydroxychloroquine</b> is another DMARD used in rheumatoid arthritis. While it can cause serious adverse effects, particularly retinopathy, it rarely causes significant pulmonary toxicity. It is not associated with the development of interstitial lung disease or restrictive lung patterns.<br /><br /><b>Ciclosporin</b> is an immunosuppressant that can cause various side effects, including nephrotoxicity and hypertension. While it can cause respiratory symptoms, particularly in the context of infection due to immunosuppression, it does not typically cause direct pulmonary toxicity leading to a restrictive pattern.<br /><br /><b>Celecoxib</b> is a selective COX-2 inhibitor used for pain management in rheumatoid arthritis. While it can cause bronchospasm in susceptible individuals, particularly those with aspirin-sensitive asthma, it does not cause interstitial lung disease or a restrictive pattern on spirometry.",
