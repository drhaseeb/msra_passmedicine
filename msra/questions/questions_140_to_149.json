            "<b>Rivaroxaban</b> is correct. The electrocardiogram shows an irregularly irregular rhythm with inconsistent/absent p waves. This patient has presented with atrial fibrillation. His symptoms are shortness of breath and palpitations and his signs are an irregular pulse, confirmed on the electrocardiogram. Note the lack of visible p waves in front of every QRS complex and the lack of regular rhythm (compare the distance between two 'R's on the QRS complexes.) This is termed an irregularly irregular rhythm and is diagnosed as atrial fibrillation. For patients with atrial fibrillation, one must calculate their CHA2DS2-VASc score. In this case, it is 3 (congestive cardiac failure, age 65-74 years, diabetes). Since this score is above 0-1, anticoagulation is indicated. Oral anticoagulation using a DOAC such as rivaroxaban is now the first-line recommended management for long-term risk reduction in strokes for these patients.<br /><br /><b>Aspirin</b> is incorrect. This would reduce the risk of atherosclerotic (arterial) risks such as myocardial infarction but not the risk of venous clots which are targeted by anticoagulation. The risks of taking aspirin outweigh any benefits of taking it as monotherapy for stroke prevention in adults with atrial fibrillation.<br /><br /><b>Enoxaparin</b> is incorrect. Although this is an anticoagulant and would reduce the risk of clots and strokes, it is a subcutaneous injection and is not the first-line drug for the prevention of stroke in atrial fibrillation. It is commonly used for venous thromboembolism prophylaxis during pregnancy or for inpatients awaiting surgery. <br /><br /><b>No medication necessary</b> is incorrect. This patient is at high risk of having a stroke and needs anticoagulation. The risk increases as the CHA2DS2-VASc score increases. Since this score is above 0-1, anticoagulation is indicated.<br /><br /><b>Warfarin</b> is incorrect. Although warfarin is an anticoagulant and would be effective in reducing stroke risk, it is no longer first-line for patients with atrial fibrillation that are being anticoagulated. This is because DOACs such as rivaroxaban do not require monitoring and are therefore easier for patients. Warfarin has a narrow therapeutic index and must be monitored by checking the international normalised ratio. It also has many drug interactions which are less common in DOACs.",

        "title": "Atrial fibrillation: a very basic introduction",
        "body": "Atrial fibrillation (AF) is the most common sustained cardiac arrhythmia. It is very common, being present in around 5% of patients over aged 70-75 years and 10% of patients aged 80-85 years. Whilst uncontrolled atrial fibrillation can result in symptomatic palpitations and inefficient cardiac function probably the most important aspect of managing patients with AF is reducing the increased risk of stroke which is present in these patients.<br /><br /><br /><h5 class='notes-heading'>Types of atrial fibrillation</h5><br />AF may by classified as either first detected episode, paroxysmal, persistent or permanent.<br /><ul><li><span class=\"concept\" data-cid=\"7653\">first detected episode</span> (irrespective of whether it is symptomatic or self-terminating)</li><li>recurrent episodes, when a patient has 2 or more episodes of AF. If episodes of AF terminate spontaneously then the term <b><span class=\"concept\" data-cid=\"7654\">paroxysmal AF</span></b> is used. Such episodes last less than 7 days (typically < 24 hours). If the arrhythmia is not self-terminating then the term <b><span class=\"concept\" data-cid=\"7655\">persistent AF</span></b> is used. Such episodes usually last greater than 7 days</li><li>in <b><span class=\"concept\" data-cid=\"7656\">permanent AF</span></b> there is continuous atrial fibrillation which cannot be cardioverted or if attempts to do so are deemed inappropriate. Treatment goals are therefore rated control and anticoagulation if appropriate</li></ul><br /><br /><h5 class='notes-heading'>Symptoms and signs</h5><br />Symptoms<br /><ul><li>palpitations</li><li>dyspnoea</li><li>chest pain</li></ul><br />Signs<br /><ul><li>an irregularly irregular pulse</li></ul><br /><br /><h5 class='notes-heading'>Investigations</h5><br />An ECG is essential to make the diagnosis as other conditions can give an irregular pulse, such as ventricular ectopics or sinus arrhythmia.<br /><br /><div class=\"container\"><div class=\"row\"><div class=\"col-md-3\"><a href=\"https://d32xxyeh8kfs8k.cloudfront.net/images_Passmedicine/ecg097b.png\" data-fancybox=\"gallery\" data-caption=\"Atrial fibrillation - e Image used on license from Dr Smith, University of Minnesota\"><img  class=\"img-thumbnail mx-auto d-block\" style=\"max-height:150px;margin-bottom:10px;\" src=\"https://d32xxyeh8kfs8k.cloudfront.net/images_Passmedicine/ecg097.png\" alt=\"\" /></a></div></div></div><br /><h5 class='notes-heading'>Management</h5><br />There are two key parts of managing patients with AF:<br /><ul><li>1. Rate/rhythm control</li><li>2. Reducing stroke risk</li></ul><br /><h5 class='notes-heading'>Rate vs. rhythm control</h5><br />There are two main strategies employed in dealing with the arrhythmia element of atrial fibrillation:<br /><ul><li><b>rate control</b>: accept that the pulse will be irregular, but slow the rate down to avoid negative effects on cardiac function</li><li><b>rhythm control</b>: try to get the patient back into, and maintain, normal sinus rhythm. This is termed cardioversion. Drugs (pharmacological cardioversion) and synchronised DC electrical shocks (electrical cardioversion) may be used for this purpose</li></ul><br />For many years the predominant approach was to try and maintain a patient in sinus rhythm. This approach changed in the early 2000's and now the majority of patients are managed with a rate control strategy. NICE advocate using a rate control strategy except in a number of specific situations such as <span class=\"concept\" data-cid=\"3120\">coexistent heart failure, first onset AF or where there is an obvious reversible cause</span>.<br /><br /><h5 class='notes-heading'>Rate control</h5><br />A <b>beta-blocker</b> or a <b>rate-limiting calcium channel blocker</b> (e.g. diltiazem) is used first-line to control the rate in AF. <br /><br />If one drug does not control the rate adequately NICE recommend combination therapy with any 2 of the following:<br /><ul><li>a betablocker</li><li>diltiazem</li><li>digoxin</li></ul><br /><h5 class='notes-heading'>Rhythm control</h5><br />As mentioned above there are a subgroup of patients for whom a rhythm control strategy should be tried first. Other patients may have had a rate control strategy initially but switch to rhythm control if symptoms/heart rate fails to settle.<br /><br />When considering cardioversion it is very important to remember that the moment a patient switches from AF to sinus rhythm presents the highest risk for embolism leading to stroke. Imagine the thrombus formed in the fibrillating atrium suddenly being pushed out when sinus rhythm is restored. For this reason patients must either have had a short duration of symptoms (less than 48 hours) or be anticoagulated for a period of time prior to attempting cardioversion.<br /><br /><br /><h5 class='notes-heading'>Reducing stroke risk</h5><br />Some patients with AF are at a very low risk of stroke whilst others are at a very significant risk. Clinicians use risk stratifying tools such as the <b>CHA<sub>2</sub>DS<sub>2</sub>-VASc</b> score to determine the most appropriate anticoagulation strategy. <br /><br /><div class=\"table-responsive\"><table class = \"tlarge table table-striped table-bordered\"  data-role=\"table\" id=\"tableid1\" ><thead><tr><th></th><th><b>Risk factor</b></th><th><b>     Points</b></th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td> <b>C</b></td><td>Congestive heart failure</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td> <b>H</b></td><td>Hypertension (or treated hypertension)</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td> <b>A<sub>2</sub></b></td><td>Age >= 75 years</td><td>2</td></tr><tr><td></td><td>Age 65-74 years</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td> <b>D</b></td><td>Diabetes</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td> <b>S<sub>2</sub></b></td><td>Prior Stroke, TIA or thromboembolism</td><td>2</td></tr><tr><td> <b>V</b></td><td>Vascular disease (including ischaemic heart disease and peripheral arterial disease)</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td><b>S</b></td><td>Sex (female)</td><td>1</td></tr></tbody></table></div><br />The table below shows a suggested anticoagulation strategy based on the score:<br /><br /><div class=\"table-responsive\"><table class = \"tlarge table table-striped table-bordered\"  data-role=\"table\" id=\"tableid2\" ><thead><tr><th><b>Score</b></th><th><b>Anticoagulation</b></th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>0</td><td><span class=\"concept\" data-cid=\"7649\">No treatment</span></td></tr><tr><td>1</td><td><span class=\"concept\" data-cid=\"7650\">Males: Consider anticoagulation</span><br /><span class=\"concept\" data-cid=\"7651\">Females: No treatment (this is because their score of 1 is only reached due to their gender)</span></td></tr><tr><td>2 or more</td><td><span class=\"concept\" data-cid=\"7652\">Offer anticoagulation</span></td></tr></tbody></table></div><br />NICE recommend that we offer patients a choice of anticoagulation, including warfarin and the novel oral anticoagulants (NOACs).",

            "The correct answer is <b>Pseudocyst</b>. A pancreatic pseudocyst is a collection of pancreatic fluid enclosed by fibrous or granulation tissue, which forms as a consequence of acute pancreatitis. The timing of presentation at 6 weeks is classical for pseudocyst formation, as these typically develop 4 or more weeks after an episode of acute pancreatitis. The location behind the stomach (in the lesser sac) is typical, and the presence of a palpable upper abdominal fullness is a common clinical finding. The mildly elevated amylase is also consistent with a pseudocyst, as these collections contain enzyme-rich pancreatic fluid.<br /><br /><b>Early fluid collection</b> is incorrect because these occur within the first 4 weeks of acute pancreatitis and would have resolved or evolved into a pseudocyst by 6 weeks. Early fluid collections lack a defined wall and are typically seen in the acute phase of pancreatitis.<br /><br /><b>Pancreatic abscess</b> is incorrect because this would typically present with signs of infection such as fever, raised inflammatory markers, and systemic illness. The patient's steady progress and lack of infective symptoms make this diagnosis unlikely.<br /><br /><b>Peripancreatic necrosis</b> is incorrect because although necrosis can occur in acute pancreatitis, it typically develops within the first few days of the illness. By 6 weeks, necrotic collections would either have resolved or evolved into walled-off necrosis. The clinical presentation described is more consistent with a pseudocyst.<br /><br /><b>Sterile necrosis</b> is incorrect for similar reasons to peripancreatic necrosis. Sterile necrosis is an early complication of acute pancreatitis, and by 6 weeks would have either resolved or evolved into a different type of collection. The timing and clinical features are much more consistent with a pseudocyst.",

        "body": "Degenerative cervical myelopathy (DCM) has a number of risk factors, which include smoking due to its effects on the intervertebral discs, genetics and occupation - those exposing patients to high axial loading [1]. <br /><br />The presentation of DCM is very variable. Early symptoms are often subtle and can vary in severity day to day, making the disease difficult to detect initially. However as a progressive condition, worsening, deteriorating or new symptoms should be a warning sign.<br /><br />DCM symptoms can include any combination of [1]: <br /><ul><li>Pain (affecting the neck, upper or lower limbs)</li><li>Loss of motor function (loss of digital dexterity, preventing simple tasks such as holding a fork or doing up their shirt buttons, arm or leg weakness/stiffness leading to impaired gait and imbalance</li><li>Loss of sensory function causing numbness</li><li>Loss of autonomic function (urinary or faecal incontinence and/or impotence) - these can occur and do not necessarily suggest cauda equina syndrome in the absence of other hallmarks of that condition</li><li>Hoffman's sign: is a reflex test to assess for cervical myelopathy. It is performed by gently flicking one finger on a patient's hand. A positive test results in reflex twitching of the other fingers on the same hand in response to the flick. </li></ul><br />The most common symptoms at presentation of DCM are unknown, but in one series 50% of patients were initially incorrectly diagnosed and sometimes treated for carpal tunnel syndrome [2].<br /><br />An MRI of the cervical spine is the gold standard test where cervical myelopathy is suspected. It may reveal disc degeneration and ligament hypertrophy, with accompanying cord signal change.<br /><br />All patients with degenerative cervical myelopathy should be urgently referred for assessment by specialist spinal services (neurosurgery or orthopaedic spinal surgery). This is due to the importance of early treatment. The timing of surgery is important, as any existing spinal cord damage can be permanent. Early treatment (within 6 months of diagnosis) offers the best chance of a full recovery but at present, most patients are presenting too late. In one study, patients averaged over 5 appointments before diagnosis, representing >2 years. <br /><br />Currently, decompressive surgery is the only effective treatment. It has been shown to prevent disease progression. Close observation is an option for mild stable disease, but anything progressive or more severe requires surgery to prevent further deterioration. Physiotherapy should only be initiated by specialist services, as manipulation can cause more spinal cord damage. <br /><br />References<br />1. Baron EM, Young WF.
