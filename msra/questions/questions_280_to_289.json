            "<b>Remain upright for at least 30 minutes after taking</b> is the correct answer. This is the single most important piece of advice to prevent the common and potentially serious side effect of oesophagitis. Oral bisphosphonates like alendronic acid can cause severe oesophageal irritation, ulceration, and strictures if they remain in contact with the oesophageal mucosa for a prolonged period. The UK's British National Formulary (BNF) specifically advises that patients should swallow the tablet whole with a full glass of water while sitting or standing, and then remain upright (either sitting or standing) for at least 30 minutes. This allows gravity to assist the tablet's passage into the stomach, minimising the risk of it lodging in the oesophagus. Failing to follow this advice is the primary cause of bisphosphonate-induced oesophageal injury.<br /><br /><b>Take the tablet with a meal to reduce stomach upset</b> is incorrect. This advice is appropriate for some medications, such as NSAIDs, but is directly contraindicated for bisphosphonates. The oral bioavailability of alendronic acid is very low (less than 1%), and the presence of food, particularly products containing calcium like dairy, can reduce its absorption by up to 60%. To be effective, the tablet must be taken on a completely empty stomach, at least 30 minutes before any food, drink, or other medication.<br /><br /><b>Ensure a dental check-up before the first dose</b> is incorrect in this context. While bisphosphonate-related osteonecrosis of the jaw (ONJ) is a recognised, serious side effect, the risk is significantly lower for patients taking oral bisphosphonates for osteoporosis compared to those receiving intravenous bisphosphonates for cancer treatment. Although good dental hygiene is important for all patients on bisphosphonates, the immediate and more common risk of severe oesophagitis from incorrect administration makes the advice to remain upright a higher priority for initial counselling in this low-risk patient.<br /><br /><b>Take the tablet immediately before bed</b> is dangerous and incorrect advice. Taking the tablet and then lying down significantly increases the risk of the tablet lodging in the oesophagus. This prolonged contact with the oesophageal lining can lead to severe chemical oesophagitis, ulceration, and bleeding. Patients must remain upright for at least 30 minutes and should not lie down until after they have eaten their first food of the day.<br /><br /><b>Take with your other morning medications</b> is incorrect. As with food, other medications can interfere with the absorption of alendronic acid. To ensure maximal absorption, it must be taken alone, with only water, at least 30 minutes before any other oral medications are consumed. Taking it concurrently with other tablets, especially supplements containing calcium or iron, would render the alendronic acid ineffective.",

The UK's British National Formulary (BNF) specifically advises that patients should swallow the tablet whole with a full glass of water while sitting or standing, and then remain upright (either sitting or standing) for at least 30 minutes. This allows gravity to assist the tablet's passage into the stomach, minimising the risk of it lodging in the oesophagus. Failing to follow this advice is the primary cause of bisphosphonate-induced oesophageal injury.<br /><br /><b>Take the tablet with a meal to reduce stomach upset</b> is incorrect. This advice is appropriate for some medications, such as NSAIDs, but is directly contraindicated for bisphosphonates. The oral bioavailability of alendronic acid is very low (less than 1%), and the presence of food, particularly products containing calcium like dairy, can reduce its absorption by up to 60%. To be effective, the tablet must be taken on a completely empty stomach, at least 30 minutes before any food, drink, or other medication.<br /><br /><b>Ensure a dental check-up before the first dose</b> is incorrect in this context. While bisphosphonate-related osteonecrosis of the jaw (ONJ) is a recognised, serious side effect, the risk is significantly lower for patients taking oral bisphosphonates for osteoporosis compared to those receiving intravenous bisphosphonates for cancer treatment. Although good dental hygiene is important for all patients on bisphosphonates, the immediate and more common risk of severe oesophagitis from incorrect administration makes the advice to remain upright a higher priority for initial counselling in this low-risk patient.<br /><br /><b>Take the tablet immediately before bed</b> is dangerous and incorrect advice. Taking the tablet and then lying down significantly increases the risk of the tablet lodging in the oesophagus. This prolonged contact with the oesophageal lining can lead to severe chemical oesophagitis, ulceration, and bleeding. Patients must remain upright for at least 30 minutes and should not lie down until after they have eaten their first food of the day.<br /><br /><b>Take with your other morning medications</b> is incorrect. As with food, other medications can interfere with the absorption of alendronic acid. To ensure maximal absorption, it must be taken alone, with only water, at least 30 minutes before any other oral medications are consumed. Taking it concurrently with other tablets, especially supplements containing calcium or iron, would render the alendronic acid ineffective.",

            "<b>Check and document inhaler technique</b> is the correct answer. According to British Thoracic Society guidelines, before discharging a patient admitted with acute asthma, their inhaler technique must be checked and documented. This is a crucial safety step that directly addresses one of the most common reasons for poor asthma control and subsequent readmissions. Poor inhaler technique means patients receive suboptimal doses of their medication, increasing the risk of future exacerbations. This patient meets other discharge criteria (stable on discharge medication for >12 hours, peak flow >75% predicted, no oxygen requirement), but cannot be safely discharged without ensuring she can use her inhalers correctly. The technique should be checked for both the reliever and preventer inhalers, and the assessment documented in the medical notes. This forms part of the comprehensive discharge planning that should also include a written asthma action plan and follow-up arrangements.<br /><br /><b>Arrange follow-up with GP within 2 weeks</b> is important and should be done before discharge, but it is not the immediate next step. Patients discharged following an acute asthma admission should have GP follow-up arranged, ideally within 2 working days, and respiratory clinic follow-up within 4 weeks. However, this can be arranged after ensuring the patient's inhaler technique is adequate, as without proper technique, even with good follow-up arrangements, the patient remains at high risk of further exacerbations.<br /><br /><b>Measure arterial blood gas</b> is not indicated in this stable patient. BTS guidelines recommend arterial blood gases for patients with oxygen saturations <92% or those with life-threatening features. This patient is clinically stable, not requiring oxygen, and has a good peak flow reading. An ABG would be invasive and unnecessary at this point, adding no useful information to guide her immediate management or discharge planning.<br /><br /><b>Request chest radiograph</b> is not routinely indicated before discharge in uncomplicated acute asthma. BTS guidelines recommend chest radiographs only in specific circumstances: life-threatening asthma, suspected pneumothorax, or failure to respond to treatment. This patient has responded well to treatment and has no features suggesting complications. A routine chest radiograph would delay discharge unnecessarily and expose the patient to radiation without clinical benefit.<br /><br /><b>Continue observation for further 24 hours</b> is unnecessary as the patient already meets the clinical criteria for discharge. She has been stable on her discharge medication (inhalers without nebulisers or oxygen) for 36 hours, which exceeds the recommended 12-24 hour stability period. Her peak flow is >75% predicted. Keeping her in hospital longer than necessary increases the risk of hospital-acquired infections, uses valuable bed resources, and provides no additional clinical benefit once discharge criteria are met and inhaler technique is confirmed.",

            "The correct answer is the <b>skin patch test</b>. This form of testing is most appropriate for diagnosing contact dermatitis, which is suspected in this case due to the patient's reaction to her new wristwatch. The skin patch test involves applying a small amount of suspect allergen (in this case nickel) onto a patch, which is then placed on the patient's skin. After 48 hours, the patch is removed and any reaction is assessed. This test is considered safe and effective for diagnosing allergic contact dermatitis.<br /><br />On the other hand, a <b>skin prick test</b> would not be suitable in this instance. This type of test is primarily used to identify immediate hypersensitivity reactions, such as those seen in food or respiratory allergies. It involves introducing small amounts of allergens into the skin via tiny pricks or punctures and observing for an immediate wheal-and-flare reaction.<br /><br />A <b>skin biopsy</b>, while useful in certain circumstances, would not be the best initial investigation for suspected allergic contact dermatitis. Skin biopsies are generally reserved for cases where there are diagnostic uncertainties such as unresolving lesions or suspicion of malignancy.<br /><br /><b>Serum IgE</b> levels can be elevated in many types of allergic reactions but they do not specifically indicate an allergy to nickel nor do they provide information about the particular type of allergy (contact vs respiratory vs food).

When the immune system encounters these non-toxic toxoids, it learns to combat the natural toxins the bacteria produce, providing immunity against the toxic effects of infections</li><li>toxoid vaccines often require booster doses to maintain immunity since, like inactivated vaccines, the immune response they induce can wane over time</li><li>examples:<ul><li><span class=\"concept\" data-cid=\"6352\">tetanus</span></li><li><span class=\"concept\" data-cid=\"6353\">diphtheria</span></li><li><span class=\"concept\" data-cid=\"6354\">pertussis</span></li></ul></li></ul><br />Subunit and conjugate vaccines are often grouped together.
