            "<b>Micturating cystography</b> is the correct answer. 25% of children <6 years of age with a urinary tract infection (UTI) have vesicoureteral reflux (VUR). The 'valve' problem the mother recalls is alluding to VUR. The family history, combined with the age of the patient and the abnormal ultrasound findings, indicates VUR as the underlying cause of her recurrent UTI. The severity is graded (as summarised in the table below) with a voiding cystourethrogram, otherwise known as micturating cystography. This test takes around 15-20 minutes and involves injecting a dye into the bladder via a catheter, and taking x-ray images whilst the child passes urine. It is important to detect VUR early, as it can result in scarring of the kidneys (reflux nephropathy). <br /><br /><b>Bladder ultrasound</b> is not correct. Whilst it is useful to do ultrasound imaging of the urinary tract including the kidneys (not the bladder alone), ultrasound would not be used to grade the severity of VUR.<br /><br /><b>CT abdomen</b> is not indicated and would be unjustified exposure to radiation.<br /><br /><b>Dimercaptosuccinic acid (DMSA) scan</b> would be useful in assessing renal parenchymal defects which may result from VUR, and would usually be performed within 6 months of an acute infection in all children with recurrent UTI. However, it is not able to grade the severity so is not the correct answer here.<br /><br /><b>Urine culture for fungus</b> is not correct. It should be considered in immunosuppressed patients, but this case is in keeping with VUR as the cause of recurrent UTI rather than atypical organisms.",
