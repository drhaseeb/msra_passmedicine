            "<b>Pain on resisted wrist extension with elbow extended</b> is the pathognomonic test for lateral epicondylitis (tennis elbow). This condition involves inflammation or degeneration of the common extensor tendon origin at the lateral epicondyle, particularly affecting the extensor carpi radialis brevis. The key diagnostic manoeuvre involves asking the patient to extend their wrist against resistance whilst the elbow is held in extension - this specifically stresses the affected tendon insertion and reproduces the characteristic pain. An alternative test involves resisted supination with the elbow extended, which also stresses the same anatomical structures. The clinical scenario describes typical features of lateral epicondylitis: onset following unaccustomed manual activity, pain with functional activities like lifting, and lateral elbow tenderness in a middle-aged patient.<br /><br /><b>Pain on resisted elbow flexion with forearm pronated</b> would be more suggestive of biceps tendinopathy or anterior compartment pathology. This test does not specifically stress the lateral epicondylar region or the common extensor tendon origin, making it less relevant for diagnosing lateral epicondylitis.<br /><br /><b>Pain on resisted wrist flexion with elbow flexed</b> would more likely indicate medial epicondylitis (golfer's elbow) or flexor tendon pathology. This test stresses the medial epicondylar region and flexor muscle origins, which is anatomically distinct from the lateral pathology described in this case.<br /><br /><b>Pain on passive elbow extension with forearm supinated</b> represents a passive rather than active test and would not specifically stress the extensor tendon origins. Passive movements typically do not reproduce pain in lateral epicondylitis unless there is significant joint pathology or capsular involvement.<br /><br /><b>Pain on resisted elbow extension with wrist flexed</b> primarily tests the triceps muscle and posterior elbow structures rather than the lateral epicondylar region.

            "<b>Apixaban</b> is the correct answer. This patient has had a TIA in the context of newly diagnosed atrial fibrillation. Following a TIA, once imaging has excluded haemorrhage (which has been done with the CT head), anticoagulation for atrial fibrillation should be started immediately. NICE recommends either warfarin or a direct oral anticoagulant (DOAC) such as apixaban (a factor Xa inhibitor), rivaroxaban, edoxaban, or dabigatran (a direct thrombin inhibitor) for stroke prevention in atrial fibrillation. DOACs are generally preferred over warfarin due to their more predictable pharmacokinetics, lack of need for monitoring, and lower risk of intracranial haemorrhage. The key principle here is that atrial fibrillation is a significant risk factor for cardioembolic stroke, and this patient requires anticoagulation rather than antiplatelet therapy for secondary stroke prevention.<br /><br /><b>Aspirin</b> monotherapy is not appropriate for this patient. While aspirin has antiplatelet effects, it is inferior to anticoagulation for stroke prevention in atrial fibrillation. Following the discovery of atrial fibrillation in a patient who has had a TIA, anticoagulation is the treatment of choice. Aspirin alone would leave this patient at significant risk of further thromboembolic events from her atrial fibrillation.<br /><br /><b>Clopidogrel</b> monotherapy is also inappropriate. Although clopidogrel is used for secondary prevention following TIA or stroke in patients without atrial fibrillation, it does not provide adequate protection against cardioembolic stroke in patients with atrial fibrillation. The mechanism of thrombus formation in atrial fibrillation requires anticoagulation rather than antiplatelet therapy. Using clopidogrel alone would significantly undertreat this patient's stroke risk.<br /><br /><b>Aspirin and clopidogrel</b> dual antiplatelet therapy is not the correct choice. While dual antiplatelet therapy may be used in certain acute coronary syndromes or following percutaneous coronary intervention, it is not appropriate for stroke prevention in atrial fibrillation. Even the combination of two antiplatelet agents does not provide equivalent protection to anticoagulation in preventing cardioembolic stroke. This patient requires anticoagulation.<br /><br /><b>Aspirin and dipyridamole</b> is the standard antiplatelet combination used for secondary prevention following TIA or ischaemic stroke in patients without atrial fibrillation. However, in this case, the patient has atrial fibrillation, which fundamentally changes the management approach. Anticoagulation is superior to antiplatelet therapy for preventing cardioembolic stroke in atrial fibrillation, and using aspirin and dipyridamole would represent inadequate treatment for this patient's condition.",

            "The correct answer is <b>Grapefruit juice</b>. Simvastatin, a commonly prescribed statin for the management of hyperlipidaemia, has potential drug interactions with grapefruit juice. This is due to the fact that grapefruit juice contains certain chemicals that can interfere with the enzymes responsible for metabolising simvastatin in the body (specifically CYP3A4 enzymes). The inhibition of these enzymes can lead to an increased concentration of simvastatin in the bloodstream, which may increase the risk of side effects such as myopathy and rhabdomyolysis.<br /><br /><b>Orange juice</b> does not interact with simvastatin. While it is acidic and could theoretically affect the absorption of some medications, there's no specific interaction between orange juice and simvastatin.<br /><br />Similarly, <b>Apple juice</b> does not have any known significant interactions with simvastatin. It also doesn't contain substances that inhibit CYP3A4 enzymes like grapefruit juice does.<br /><br /><b>Cranberry juice</b> is generally safe to consume while taking simvastatin. However, it should be noted that cranberry juice may interact with other medications such as warfarin - but this is not relevant to this question about statins.<br /><br />Lastly, <b>Carrot juice</b>, like apple and orange juices, does not have any known interactions with simvastatin.",

            "This stem describes an older woman presenting with a labial lump and inguinal lymphadenopathy, which should raise a suspicion of vulval carcinoma. This is supported by the labia lump being firm and growing in size over a short period of just 3 weeks. Risk factors for vulval carcinoma include increased age, smoking, and human papillomavirus (HPV).<br /><br />Bartholin's cyst is an incorrect answer. A Bartholin's cyst is a small, fluid-filled cyst that is caused by an obstructed Bartholin's gland duct. Unlike this patient's presentation, Bartholin's cysts typically are painful and soft on examination.<br /><br />Condylomata lata is an incorrect answer. Condylomata lata is a benign vulval lesion, which refers to the wart-like lesions seen in secondary syphilis. Given that condylomata lata is rare and the patient has no other known history, this makes this answer less likely. Furthermore, the presence of rapid growth and inguinal lymphadenopathy should raise concerns for vulval carcinoma.<br /><br />Lipoma is incorrect. Lipoma is a benign vulval lesion that occurs with fat deposition in the soft tissue. Unlike this stem, lipomas are typically soft and not known to grow rapidly. The presence of inguinal lymphadenopathy also makes this option less likely.<br /><br />Sebaceous cyst is not a correct answer. A sebaceous cyst is a soft lump caused by keratin collecting beneath the skin. They are typically slow-growing, benign, and it would not be unusual for inguinal lymphadenopathy to be present with them. A vulval carcinoma would be more likely to cause lymphadenopathy.",
