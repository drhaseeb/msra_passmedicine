This patient presents with multiple challenging factors: she had unprotected intercourse 6 days ago (beyond the 120-hour window for hormonal methods) and also 2 days ago; she takes carbamazepine (an enzyme-inducing drug that reduces hormonal contraceptive efficacy); and she has a BMI of 31 kg/m\u00b2. <br /><br />Critically, even though the first episode of unprotected intercourse was 6 days ago, the copper IUD can still be inserted up to 5 days after the earliest estimated date of ovulation. With her variable cycle length of 28-32 days and current day 18 of her cycle, she is likely approaching or at her fertile window.

First, it's only licensed for use within 72 hours of unprotected intercourse, making it unsuitable for the episode 6 days ago. Second, the standard 1.5mg dose would be inadequate given her BMI >26 and concomitant use of carbamazepine, which induces liver enzymes that metabolize levonorgestrel, reducing its effectiveness.<br /><br /><b>Levonorgestrel 3mg</b> (double dose) would address her high BMI and enzyme-inducing medication, but still falls short for the episode 6 days ago as it's outside the 72-hour window.

Additionally, ulipristal's effectiveness is also reduced by enzyme-inducing drugs like carbamazepine, and there are concerns about reduced efficacy in women with higher BMI.

One common way this can occur is as a consequence of congestive heart failure. In severe cases cirrhosis may occur.</td></tr><tr><td><b>Biliary colic</b></td><td>RUQ pain, intermittent, usually begins abruptly and subsides gradually. Attacks often occur after eating. Nausea is common.<br /><br />It is sometimes taught that patients are female, forties, fat and fair although this is obviously a generalisation.</td></tr><tr><td><b>Acute cholecystitis </b></td><td>Pain similar to biliary colic but more severe and persistent. The pain may radiate to the back or right shoulder. <br /><br />The patient may be pyrexial and Murphy's sign positive (arrest of inspiration on palpation of the RUQ)</td></tr><tr><td><b>Ascending cholangitis</b></td><td>An infection of the bile ducts commonly secondary to gallstones. Classically presents with a triad of:<br /><ul><li>fever (rigors are common)</li><li>RUQ pain</li><li>jaundice</td></tr><tr><td></li></ul><b>Gallstone ileus</b></td><td>This describes small bowel obstruction secondary to an impacted gallstone. It may develop if a fistula forms between a gangrenous gallbladder and the duodenum.<br /><br />Abdominal pain, distension and vomiting are seen.</td></tr><tr><td><b>Cholangiocarcinoma</b></td><td>Persistent biliary colic symptoms, associated with anorexia, jaundice and weight loss. A palpable mass in the right upper quadrant (Courvoisier sign), periumbilical lymphadenopathy (Sister Mary Joseph nodes) and left supraclavicular adenopathy (Virchow node) may be seen</td></tr><tr><td><b>Acute pancreatitis</b></td><td>Usually due to alcohol or gallstones<br />Severe epigastric pain<br />Vomiting is common<br />Examination may reveal tenderness, ileus and low-grade fever<br />Periumbilical discolouration (Cullen's sign) and flank discolouration (Grey-Turner's sign) is described but rare</td></tr><tr><td><b>Pancreatic cancer</b></td><td>Painless jaundice is the classical presentation of pancreatic cancer. However pain is actually a relatively common presenting symptom of pancreatic cancer. Anorexia and weight loss are common</td></tr><tr><td><b>Amoebic liver abscess</b></td><td>Typical symptoms are malaise, anorexia and weight loss. The associated RUQ pain tends to be mild and jaundice is uncommon.</td></tr></tbody></table></div>",

            "This patient has an inguinal hernia. An inguinal hernia is a protrusion of abdominal contents through the abdominal wall. They commonly present as a lump in the groin that is more pronounced on straining with a cough impulse. They may or may not be reducible on examination. Other symptoms include pain and a dragging sensation. Occasionally, the abdominal viscera (usually small bowel or omenta) can become trapped in the hernial sac causing sudden onset pain and small bowel obstruction. Anatomically, they are located superiorly and medially to the pubic tubercle. <br /><br />A femoral hernia also presents similarly as a painful groin lump. It may also be more prominent on standing and straining and disappear whilst sitting. Although femoral hernias are more common in women, inguinal hernias are the most common type of hernia overall. A femoral hernia is located laterally and inferiorly to the pubic tubercle.<br /><br />A femoral artery aneurysm is secondary to weakness in the arterial wall. They commonly present as a pulsatile mass which is not mentioned in the question. <br /><br />A lipoma is a benign growth of adipose tissue. They are often smooth and firm and are located in the subcutaneous tissue. Lipomas are generally asymptomatic. The clinical history and examination findings are not in keeping with a lipoma and should suggest an alternative diagnosis. <br /><br />A saphena varix is a dilatation of the great saphenous vein at the junction with the femoral vein in the groin. They are sometimes associated with varicose veins. A saphena varix may be confused with a hernia as it may demonstrate a cough impulse.

            "<b>Intravenous magnesium sulphate</b> is correct. This woman has presented with eclampsia, diagnosed by the convulsions she has had (a tonic-clonic seizure). For the past 2 days, it is likely that she has had pre-eclampsia, as seen by the headaches and generalised oedema occurring after 20 weeks. The most appropriate initial management for eclampsia is IV magnesium sulphate to prevent further seizures and provide neuroprotection to the foetus followed by considering delivery. Both the mother and fetus should be assessed for signs of hypermagnesaemia, via symptoms of hyperreflexia and respiratory depression, and continuous cardiotocography monitoring.<br /><br /><b>Emergency caesarean section</b> is incorrect. Whilst this may be required, the woman needs to be stabilised before this can be considered as she is still at high risk of having further seizures. Her blood pressure is 179/115 mmHg which is too high. Therefore the most appropriate initial management is immediate magnesium sulphate and then intravenous anti-hypertensives.<br /><br /><b>Intravenous furosemide and monitor cardiotocography</b> is incorrect. Furosemide has no role in the lowering of blood pressure in eclampsia. The blood pressure is lowered with intravenous labetalol and hydralazine, which will be given as soon as the seizures have been controlled with magnesium sulphate.<br /><br /><b>Intramuscular steroids</b> is incorrect. These are only required from 24 weeks to 34+6 weeks. This woman is 35 weeks pregnant meaning the fetal lungs should be fully developed by now. Furthermore, this is not the most important management at this stage even if the woman was earlier in her pregnancy.<br /><br /><b>Oral labetalol and hydralazine</b> is incorrect. The blood pressure is very high and does require lowering. However, the first-line management, in pre-eclampsia, is intravenous labetalol and hydralazine, not oral. Furthermore, this would not reduce the risk of her seizures (eclampsia). The blood pressure is high from this woman having pre-eclampsia which whilst it can be controlled, can only be fully treated by delivery of the baby. The most important and first-line drug to prescribe in this acute scenario is intravenous magnesium sulphate to reduce the risk of further seizures. Once magnesium sulphate has been given, blood pressure-lowering medications such as intravenous labetalol and intravenous hydralazine can be given to reduce the risk of complications such as stroke and myocardial infarctions.",
