            "The correct answer is <b>Urea = 15.4 mmol/l on a background of normal renal function</b>. In upper gastrointestinal bleeding, blood proteins are broken down by digestive enzymes in the gut and absorbed, leading to increased urea production in the liver. This process results in a disproportionate rise in blood urea compared to creatinine, known as the blood urea to creatinine ratio (BUN:Cr ratio). A raised urea in the context of previously normal renal function is therefore a reliable indicator of significant upper GI blood loss.<br /><br /><b>Creatinine = 190 \u00b5mol/l on a background of normal renal function</b> is incorrect. While acute kidney injury can occur in severe bleeding due to hypoperfusion, creatinine rises more slowly than urea and is not a specific marker for GI bleeding. An isolated rise in creatinine is more likely to indicate other causes of acute kidney injury.<br /><br /><b>Platelets of 89 * 10<sup>9</sup>/l</b> is incorrect. Though thrombocytopenia can occur in severe bleeding due to consumption and dilution, this level is only mildly reduced and could be due to many other causes. It is not a specific indicator of significant GI blood loss.<br /><br /><b>Potassium = 2.9 mmol/l</b> is incorrect. Hypokalaemia can occur in GI bleeding due to losses in gastric contents and stress response, but it is neither sensitive nor specific for significant bleeding. It can occur in many other conditions and with vomiting alone.<br /><br /><b>Sodium = 147 mmol/l</b> is incorrect. A mildly elevated sodium is not specifically associated with GI bleeding. It could indicate mild dehydration but can occur in many other conditions and is not a reliable indicator of significant blood loss.",

            "The correct answer is <b>Clarithromycin</b>. This macrolide antibiotic is known to interact with statins, particularly simvastatin, which the patient is taking. The interaction between clarithromycin and simvastatin can increase the risk of myopathy or rhabdomyolysis, a severe muscle condition that can lead to kidney damage. Both conditions are associated with elevated creatine kinase levels. Clarithromycin inhibits CYP3A4, an enzyme involved in the metabolism of many drugs including simvastatin. When CYP3A4 is inhibited by clarithromycin, it can lead to increased levels of simvastatin in the body, thereby increasing the risk of statin-related side effects such as myalgia and elevated creatine kinase levels.<br /><br />Discussing other options:<br /><br /><b>Rifampicin</b> is an antibiotic used primarily for treating tuberculosis. It does not typically cause muscle pain or elevate creatine kinase levels. Instead, rifampicin is known for inducing liver enzymes and can actually decrease plasma concentrations of several drugs including statins.<br /><br /><b>Felodipine</b>, a calcium channel blocker used for managing hypertension and angina, also does not commonly cause myalgia or raise creatine kinase levels.<br /><br /><b>Isosorbide mononitrate</b>, a nitrate used for preventing angina attacks, could theoretically cause muscle pain due to its vasodilatory effects leading to hypoperfusion but it's unlikely to be responsible for significantly raised creatine kinase levels.<br /><br />Lastly, <b>Amitriptyline</b>, a tricyclic antidepressant, may occasionally cause muscular side effects such as weakness or stiffness but it's also unlikely to be associated with markedly raised creatine kinase levels.",

            "The correct answer is antiphospholipid syndrome. The key features in this case pointing towards antiphospholipid syndrome (APS) are the young female patient with recurrent deep vein thrombosis, mild thrombocytopenia (platelet count 137), and a prolonged activated partial thromboplastin time (APTT) of 46 seconds.

The presence of thrombocytopenia is also a common finding in APS.<br /><br /><b>Third generation oral contraceptive pill use</b> can indeed increase the risk of thrombosis, but would not explain the prolonged APTT or the thrombocytopenia. Additionally, the contraceptive pill would typically be discontinued after the first thrombotic event, making this an unlikely cause of recurrent thrombosis.<br /><br /><b>Protein C deficiency</b> is an inherited thrombophilia that can cause recurrent thrombosis, but it does not typically affect the APTT or platelet count.

            "<b>Low premorbid IQ</b> is the correct answer. A lower level of intellectual functioning before the onset of illness is one of the most robust predictors of a poor long-term outcome in schizophrenia. It is associated with poorer functional outcomes across multiple domains, including occupational functioning, independent living, and social relationships. Cognitive deficits are considered a core feature of schizophrenia, and a lower premorbid baseline suggests less cognitive reserve to withstand the impact of the illness. This can also affect the individual's ability to engage with and benefit from complex psychosocial interventions and manage their medication regimen effectively, leading to lower treatment adherence and a higher risk of relapse. Therefore, a comprehensive assessment in a first-episode psychosis service will often include an estimation of premorbid IQ to help formulate a realistic long-term management plan and prognosis.<br /><br /><b>Acute onset</b> is associated with a better prognosis. A rapid, acute development of psychotic symptoms, often in response to a clear precipitating stressor, generally predicts a better outcome than a gradual, insidious onset. A slow, creeping onset is often associated with a long prodromal phase of social withdrawal and functional decline, which are themselves poor prognostic markers. An acute presentation may suggest a more reactive process that is more likely to respond well to initial treatment and may be associated with less severe underlying neuropathology.<br /><br /><b>Female sex</b> is a well-established good prognostic factor in schizophrenia. Compared to males, females tend to have a later age of onset, better premorbid social and occupational functioning, and a clinical presentation with fewer negative symptoms and less cognitive impairment. They often show a better response to antipsychotic medication and have fewer and shorter hospitalisations. The reasons for this are thought to be multifactorial, potentially including the neuroprotective effects of oestrogen and different psychosocial developmental trajectories.<br /><br /><b>Good social support</b> is a strong predictor of a better outcome in schizophrenia. The presence of a supportive network of family and friends is crucial for recovery. It improves medication adherence, provides emotional and practical support, reduces social isolation, and can help in the early identification of relapse signatures. Psychosocial interventions, such as family therapy, are a key component of management precisely because they aim to strengthen this support system, which in turn reduces relapse rates and improves overall quality of life.<br /><br /><b>Older age of onset</b> is associated with a better prognosis. Onset of schizophrenia in the late 20s or 30s generally carries a better prognosis than onset in adolescence or early adulthood, as seen in this patient. A later onset means the individual has had more opportunity to achieve key developmental milestones, such as completing education, establishing a career, and forming stable relationships. This results in better premorbid functioning and greater personal and social resources to cope with the illness. Early-onset schizophrenia is often more severe and associated with greater neurodevelopmental impairment.",
