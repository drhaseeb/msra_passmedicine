            "<b>Ibuprofen</b> is the correct answer and most appropriate first-line treatment for primary dysmenorrhoea in this case. NSAIDs like ibuprofen work by inhibiting prostaglandin synthesis, which is the primary mechanism causing menstrual pain. They are effective, well-tolerated, and have a strong evidence base. According to NICE guidelines, NSAIDs should be offered as first-line treatment for primary dysmenorrhoea, and ibuprofen specifically is recommended due to its favourable side effect profile and over-the-counter availability.<br /><br /><b>Tranexamic acid</b> is incorrect because it is primarily used to treat heavy menstrual bleeding (menorrhagia). This patient specifically has normal blood loss, making tranexamic acid inappropriate as a first-line treatment. While it can reduce menstrual blood loss by up to 50%, it has no direct effect on dysmenorrhoea.<br /><br /><b>Referral for relaxation therapy</b> is incorrect as a first-line treatment. While relaxation techniques may be helpful as an adjunct therapy, they should not be the primary intervention before simple analgesics have been tried. This would be over-medicalising the condition unnecessarily.<br /><br /><b>Paracetamol</b> is incorrect because, although it can provide some pain relief, it does not address the underlying prostaglandin-mediated mechanism of primary dysmenorrhoea. While it may be used in combination with NSAIDs, it is not as effective as NSAIDs when used alone.<br /><br /><b>Combined oral contraceptive pill</b> is incorrect as a first-line treatment. While the COCP can be very effective for managing dysmenorrhoea by suppressing ovulation and reducing prostaglandin production, it should be considered as a second-line treatment after NSAIDs have been tried. Additionally, prescribing hormonal contraception requires careful consideration of risks and benefits, and simpler treatments should be tried first.",

            "<b>Right coronary</b>: The right coronary artery (RCA) supplies the atrioventricular (AV) node in the majority of individuals. Infarction in this territory can lead to bradyarrhythmias and hypotension due to impaired conduction through the AV node, as described in this scenario. Inferior myocardial infarctions, typically caused by RCA occlusion, are classically associated with these findings, especially when accompanied by cardiovascular risk factors such as diabetes and hypertension.<br /><br /><b>Left anterior descending</b>: While the left anterior descending (LAD) artery supplies a large portion of the ventricular myocardium and septum, infarction here more commonly results in tachyarrhythmias or heart failure rather than bradycardia and hypotension due to AV nodal dysfunction. LAD infarcts tend to present with anterior ECG changes and less frequently cause conduction block.<br /><br /><b>Left circumflex</b>: The left circumflex artery supplies the lateral wall of the left ventricle; it may occasionally supply part of the posterior wall but rarely causes significant AV nodal involvement unless there is anomalous anatomy or dominance. Circumflex occlusions are less likely to present with profound bradycardia without other features.<br /><br /><b>Posterior descending</b>: Although the posterior descending artery can arise from either the RCA or circumflex depending on coronary dominance, it is not typically referred to independently as a culprit vessel in acute presentations affecting AV nodal function; its involvement would depend on which main artery gives rise to it.<br /><br /><b>Diagonal branch</b>: This branch arises from the LAD and supplies part of the anterolateral wall of the left ventricle. Infarction here would not be expected to affect AV nodal conduction significantly or cause pronounced bradycardia/hypotension.",

On examination, he is hypotensive and bradycardic (36/min). His troponin is elevated. Which coronary artery is most likely responsible for his presentation?",
