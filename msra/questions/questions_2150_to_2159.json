            "<b>Squamous cell lung carcinoma</b> is the correct answer. The key to this question is interpreting the biochemical results in the context of the patient's presentation. The patient has significant hypercalcaemia, which explains his symptoms of confusion, constipation, and thirst ('bones, stones, groans, and psychic moans'). The parathyroid hormone (PTH) level is suppressed. This combination of high calcium and low PTH points towards a non-parathyroid cause of hypercalcaemia, most commonly humoral hypercalcaemia of malignancy. This occurs when a tumour secretes parathyroid hormone-related peptide (PTHrP). PTHrP binds to PTH receptors, mimicking the effects of PTH and causing hypercalcaemia, but it is not detected by the standard PTH assay, leading to feedback suppression of the parathyroid glands. Squamous cell carcinoma of the lung is the most common malignancy to secrete PTHrP. The patient's extensive smoking history is a major risk factor for this type of cancer.<br /><br /><b>Small cell lung carcinoma</b> is a plausible alternative given the smoking history, as it is strongly associated with smoking and is well-known for causing paraneoplastic syndromes. However, the classical endocrine paraneoplastic syndromes associated with small cell lung cancer are the Syndrome of Inappropriate ADH (SIADH), causing hyponatraemia, and ectopic ACTH production, causing Cushing's syndrome. While hypercalcaemia can occur, it is much less common than with squamous cell carcinoma and is not the classic association.<br /><br /><b>Lung adenocarcinoma</b> is now the most common type of non-small cell lung cancer, even in smokers. While it can cause paraneoplastic syndromes, including hypertrophic pulmonary osteoarthropathy (HPOA), it is less commonly associated with PTHrP-mediated hypercalcaemia than squamous cell carcinoma. Given the classic biochemical picture of humoral hypercalcaemia of malignancy in a heavy smoker, squamous cell carcinoma remains the most likely histological subtype.<br /><br /><b>Multiple myeloma</b> is an important differential diagnosis for hypercalcaemia in an older adult. It causes hypercalcaemia via the production of osteoclast-activating factors by malignant plasma cells, leading to widespread lytic bone lesions. This would also present with a suppressed PTH level. However, lung cancer is statistically a more common cause of malignancy-related hypercalcaemia, and the profound smoking history in this patient makes a primary lung malignancy the most probable underlying cause.<br /><br /><b>Primary hyperparathyroidism</b> is the most common cause of hypercalcaemia in the community, typically due to a benign parathyroid adenoma. In this condition, there is autonomous secretion of PTH, which drives the calcium level up. Therefore, the biochemical picture would be a high or inappropriately normal PTH level in the presence of hypercalcaemia. The patient's markedly suppressed PTH level effectively excludes this diagnosis.",

        "title": "Vitamin D supplementation",
        "body": "Vitamin D supplementation has been a hot topic for a number of years now. The muddied waters are now slightly clearer following the release of the following:<br /><ul><li>2012: letter by the Chief Medical Officer regarding vitamin D supplementation</li><li>2013: National Osteoporosis Society (NOS) release UK Vitamin D guideline</li></ul><br />The following groups should be advised to take vitamin D supplementation:<br /><ul><li>all <span class=\"concept\" data-cid=\"9558\">pregnant</span> and breastfeeding women should take a daily supplement containing 10\u00b5g of vitamin D</li><li>all children aged 6 months - 5 years. Babies fed with formula milk do not need to take a supplement if they are taking more than 500ml of milk a day, as formula milk is fortified with vitamin D</li><li>adults > 65 years</li><li>'people who are not exposed to much sun should also take a daily supplement' e.g. <span class=\"concept\" data-cid=\"9554\">housebound patients</span></li></ul><br /><h5 class='notes-heading'>Testing for vitamin D deficiency</h5><br />The key message is that not many people warrant a vitamin D test. The NOS guidelines specify that testing may be appropriate in the following situtations:<br /><ul><li>patients with bone diseases that may be improved with vitamin D treatment e.g. known osteomalacia or Paget's disease</li><li>patients with bone diseases, prior to specific treatment where correcting vitamin deficiency is appropriate e,g, prior to intravenous zolendronate or denosumab</li><li>patients with musculoskeletal symptoms that could be attributed to vitamin D deficiency e.g. bone pain ?osteomalacia</li></ul><br />Patients with osteoporosis should always be given calcium/vitamin D supplements so testing is not considered necessary. People who are at higher risk of vitamin D deficiency (see above) should be treated anyway so again testing is not necessary.",
