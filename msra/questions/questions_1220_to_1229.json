        "body": "Many patients who are admitted to hospital, or treated in the community, lack capacity. In the vast majority of cases, these patients do not refuse treatment that is given that is deemed to be in their best interest. The problem arises when patients who lack (or are suspected of lacking) capacity refuse treatment.<br /><br />There are 3 main frameworks that are used in this scenario:<br /><ul><li><span class=\"concept\" data-cid=\"1017\">common law: used to treat patients in <b>emergency scenarios</b></span></li><li>Mental Capacity Act: (MCA) used in patients who require treatment for <b>physical disorders</b> that affect brain function. Remember this may be delirium secondary to sepsis or a primary brain disorder such as dementia</li><li>Mental Health Act (MHA): used in patients who require treatment for <b>mental disorders</b>. For patients already admitted to hospital, a section 5(2) is used if there is not the time for a more formal section 2 or 3. A typical scenario would be a patient who has a mental health disorder attempting to discharge themselves, when it is thought this may result in harm</li></ul><br />An excellent, more in-depth review can be found in the BMJ 'When and how to treat patients who refuse treatment'.

The child's presentation is consistent with physiological genu varum, which is a normal developmental variant in young children. Bowlegs are common in children aged between 1 and 3 years old, as their legs are adjusting to bearing weight during walking. In most cases, physiological genu varum resolves spontaneously by the age of 4 years as the child grows.<br /><br /><b>Refer to orthotics for shoe inserts</b> would not be appropriate in this case because there is no evidence of any structural abnormality or functional limitation causing the bow-legged appearance. Shoe inserts are typically used for correcting foot misalignments or providing additional support but would not address the underlying cause of physiological genu varum.<br /><br /><b>Refer to paediatric orthopaedics</b> would be unnecessary at this stage, as the child's presentation is consistent with a normal developmental variant that generally resolves on its own without intervention. Referral to a specialist should be considered if there are concerns about an underlying pathological cause or if the condition persists beyond the expected resolution age.<br /><br /><b>Refer to physiotherapy for plantar flexion stretching exercises</b> would not be helpful in this situation because plantar flexion exercises target muscles and tendons within the ankle joint and would not directly address bowleggedness.

A cystic hygroma is a fluid-filled sac commonly found in the neck, due to a malformation in the lymphatic system. There is no association with cystic fibrosis.<br /><br /><b> Hypothyroidism </b> is incorrect. Hypothyroidism is not a recognised complication of cystic fibrosis.",

            "The correct answer to this question is <b>Pseudopolyps</b>. Ulcerative colitis (UC) is a chronic inflammatory bowel disease that primarily affects the colon and rectum. It is characterised by continuous, diffuse inflammation of the mucosal layer, leading to ulceration and the formation of pseudopolyps. Pseudopolyps are non-neoplastic mucosal protrusions formed due to regeneration of the inflamed mucosa amidst areas of ulceration. They are more commonly seen in UC than in Crohn's disease.<br /><br />The first option, <b>Lesions anywhere from the mouth to anus</b>, is incorrect as it describes a characteristic feature of Crohn's disease rather than UC. In contrast to UC, which is limited to the colon and rectum, Crohn's disease can affect any part of the gastrointestinal tract from mouth to anus.<br /><br />The second option, <b>Granulomas</b>, is also not characteristic of UC but rather of Crohn's disease. Granulomas are aggregates of macrophages that have transformed into epithelioid cells in response to chronic inflammation. These are frequently observed in histological examination of tissues affected by Crohn's disease but are rarely seen in UC.<br /><br />Similarly, <b>Skip lesions</b>, described as patchy areas of inflammation separated by healthy tissue, are typical for Crohn's disease and not for UC. Ulcerative colitis presents with continuous inflammation starting from the rectum and extending proximally without skip areas.<br /><br />Lastly, <b>Inflammation in all layers from mucosa to serosa</b> refers to transmural inflammation which is again a feature more commonly associated with Crohn's disease rather than ulcerative colitis. In UC, inflammation predominantly involves the mucosa and submucosa with sparing of deeper layers unless there is fulminant colitis or toxic megacolon.<br />",
