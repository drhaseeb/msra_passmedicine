            "The correct answer is <b>Aspirin</b>. Nasal polyps are a common finding in patients with aspirin sensitivity, forming part of the Samter's triad (aspirin sensitivity, asthma and nasal polyps). Aspirin can exacerbate respiratory symptoms by inhibiting the cyclooxygenase pathway of arachidonic acid metabolism, leading to an overproduction of leukotrienes. This causes bronchoconstriction and inflammation in sensitive individuals.<br /><br /><b>Sulfa drugs</b> are not specifically associated with nasal polyps. However, they can cause a range of hypersensitivity reactions including skin rashes, fever, and in severe cases, Stevens-Johnson syndrome or toxic epidermal necrolysis. There is no known link between sulfa drugs and nasal polyp formation.<br /><br />Similarly, <b>ACE inhibitors</b> are not linked to nasal polyp formation. ACE inhibitors may cause cough as a side effect due to accumulation of bradykinin but this does not predispose to nasal polyp development. Angioedema is another potential adverse reaction to ACE inhibitors but it is distinct from nasal polyps.<br /><br /><b>Penicillins</b>, like sulfa drugs, can cause serious hypersensitivity reactions including anaphylaxis. They are also one of the most common causes of drug-induced rash. However, there is no established association between penicillins and the development of nasal polyps.<br /><br />Lastly, <b>Paracetamol</b>, although commonly used for pain relief and fever reduction, has no specific association with nasal polyps either. Paracetamol allergy or intolerance is rare and usually manifests as skin reactions rather than respiratory symptoms or nasal polyposis.<br />",

As sperm can survive in the vagina for up to 7 days, and the earliest date of ovulation after giving birth is 28 days postpartum, no contraception is needed until day 21. As this patient is 14 days postpartum, she does not need emergency contraception. <br /><br />Copper coil is an incorrect answer. The FSRH advise that the copper coil (intrauterine device; IUD) is contraindicated between 48 hours and 28 days postpartum due to the increased risk of uterine perforation and expulsion. <br /><br />Levonorgestrel (Levonelle) is a progesterone-only emergency contraceptive that can be used after day 21 postpartum. As explained, there is no indication for emergency contraception in this case. <br /><br />Mirena coil (intrauterine system; IUS) is an incorrect answer. Similarly to the copper coil, the Mirena coil should only be inserted within 48 hours of childbirth or after 4 weeks. <br /><br />Ulipristal acetate (EllaOne) is also a progesterone-only emergency contraceptive that can be used after day 21 postpartum.

        "question": "A 23-year-old female attends her pharmacy as she is concerned that she may need the emergency contraceptive pill. <br /><br />She tells you that she had unprotected sex with her long-term partner 3 days ago and didn't think about contraception, as she gave birth to a baby girl only 2 weeks ago. She is formula-feeding her baby.<br /><br />What is the most appropriate advice?",
        "correct_answer": "4",
        "question_notes": "Contraception is not required before day 21 postpartum.  As sperm can survive in the vagina for up to 7 days, and the earliest date of ovulation after giving birth is 28 days postpartum, no contraception is needed until day 21. As this patient is 14 days postpartum, she does not need emergency contraception. <br /><br />Copper coil is an incorrect answer. The FSRH advise that the copper coil (intrauterine device; IUD) is contraindicated between 48 hours and 28 days postpartum due to the increased risk of uterine perforation and expulsion. <br /><br />Levonorgestrel (Levonelle) is a progesterone-only emergency contraceptive that can be used after day 21 postpartum. As explained, there is no indication for emergency contraception in this case. <br /><br />Mirena coil (intrauterine system; IUS) is an incorrect answer. Similarly to the copper coil, the Mirena coil should only be inserted within 48 hours of childbirth or after 4 weeks. <br /><br />Ulipristal acetate (EllaOne) is also a progesterone-only emergency contraceptive that can be used after day 21 postpartum. There is no indication for emergency contraception in this case.",

            "<b>Paget's disease of bone</b> is the most likely diagnosis in this case. The patient presents with the classic triad of advanced age, bone pain, and markedly elevated alkaline phosphatase (ALP) with normal calcium and phosphate levels. Paget's disease is characterized by excessive osteoclastic bone resorption followed by disorganized osteoblastic bone formation. It typically affects older individuals, with a male predominance, and commonly involves the pelvis, spine, skull, and long bones. The isolated elevation of ALP (more than three times the upper limit of normal in this case) with normal calcium, phosphate, and liver enzymes points strongly to increased bone turnover. The patient's waddling gait is also consistent with pelvic involvement in Paget's disease, which can alter biomechanics of the hip. The next step would typically be plain radiographs, which often show a mixture of lytic and sclerotic changes.<br /><br /><b>Metastatic bone disease</b> could present with bone pain and elevated ALP, but would typically be accompanied by other systemic symptoms such as weight loss, fatigue, or symptoms related to the primary malignancy. Additionally, metastatic disease often causes hypercalcemia, which is not present in this case. The isolated elevation of ALP without other abnormalities makes metastatic disease less likely than Paget's disease in this elderly man.<br /><br /><b>Multiple myeloma</b> typically presents with bone pain, but would be expected to show additional laboratory abnormalities such as anemia, hypercalcemia, renal impairment, or abnormal protein electrophoresis. The normal hemoglobin and calcium levels make multiple myeloma less likely. Additionally, while ALP can be elevated in myeloma with extensive bone involvement, it is usually not as markedly elevated as seen in this case.<br /><br /><b>Osteomalacia</b> is characterized by inadequate mineralization of bone and can present with bone pain and elevated ALP. However, it typically also features low or low-normal calcium and phosphate levels due to vitamin D deficiency or other causes of mineral metabolism disturbance. The normal calcium and phosphate levels in this patient make osteomalacia less likely than Paget's disease.<br /><br /><b>Primary hyperparathyroidism</b> would typically present with elevated calcium levels due to increased parathyroid hormone secretion. While ALP can be elevated in hyperparathyroidism due to increased bone turnover, the normal calcium level in this case makes primary hyperparathyroidism unlikely. Additionally, primary hyperparathyroidism often presents with symptoms related to hypercalcemia rather than focal bone pain.",

It typically presents in males (sex ratio 3:1) aged 20-30 years old.<br /><br /><h5 class='notes-heading'>Investigation</h5><br />Inflammatory markers (ESR, CRP) are typically raised although normal levels do not exclude ankylosing spondylitis.<br /><br />HLA-B27 is of little use in making the diagnosis as it is positive in:<br /><ul><li>90% of patients with ankylosing spondylitis</li><li>10% of normal patients</li></ul><br />Plain x-ray of the sacroiliac joints is the most useful investigation in establishing the diagnosis.
