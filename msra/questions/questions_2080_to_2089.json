Approximately 50% of scleritis cases are linked to systemic conditions, most commonly RA. However, approximately 30% of episcleritis cases are also linked to systemic conditions such as RA.<br /><br />The presence of <b>redness</b> in itself is not a distinguishing factor, as both conditions lead to visible redness of the eye. On further examination, however, it will be noted that the vessels in episcleritis are mobile and blanch, but are immobile and do not blanch in scleritis.",

            "The correct answer is <b>Migraine</b>. Migraine is the most common cause of recurrent headaches in children, accounting for approximately 60-80% of cases presenting to primary care or specialist paediatric neurology clinics. Childhood migraine typically presents with recurrent episodes of moderate to severe headache that may be bilateral (unlike the classic unilateral presentation in adults), throbbing in nature, and often accompanied by nausea, vomiting, photophobia, and phonophobia. In children, attacks are typically shorter than in adults, sometimes lasting less than 2 hours. Family history is often positive, as migraine has a strong genetic component. The prevalence of migraine increases throughout childhood, affecting approximately 3-10% of children, with a slight male predominance before puberty, after which it becomes more common in females.<br /><br /><b>Tension-type headache</b> is the second most common cause of headaches in children, but is less common than migraine in those presenting to healthcare services. Tension-type headaches typically present as bilateral, pressing or tightening (non-pulsating) pain of mild to moderate intensity that is not aggravated by routine physical activity. These headaches are not usually associated with nausea or vomiting, though either photophobia or phonophobia (but not both) may be present. While tension-type headaches are common in the general population, children with these headaches are less likely to present to medical attention compared to those with migraine due to their typically milder nature.<br /><br /><b>Refractive errors</b> can cause headaches in children, but they are not the most common primary cause of recurrent headaches. Uncorrected refractive errors, particularly hypermetropia (long-sightedness), can lead to eyestrain and secondary headaches, typically occurring after prolonged visual tasks such as reading or screen use. These headaches are often frontal or periorbital and worsen with visual effort. However, studies have shown that while visual problems should be considered in the differential diagnosis of recurrent headaches, they account for a relatively small proportion of primary headache disorders in children.<br /><br /><b>Depression</b> may be associated with headaches in children, but it is not a primary cause of headaches. Rather, there is a bidirectional relationship between headaches (particularly migraine) and depression, with each condition potentially exacerbating the other. Children with chronic headaches have higher rates of depression and anxiety, and psychological factors can contribute to headache chronification. However, depression would not be considered the primary aetiology of headaches in most children presenting with this symptom.<br /><br /><b>Cluster headache</b> is extremely rare in children, particularly before adolescence. This primary headache disorder is characterised by severe, strictly unilateral pain typically around the orbital or temporal region, lasting 15-180 minutes and occurring in clusters of frequent attacks over weeks to months. Cluster headaches are accompanied by ipsilateral autonomic features such as conjunctival injection, lacrimation, nasal congestion, rhinorrhoea, facial sweating, miosis, ptosis, or eyelid oedema. The prevalence of cluster headache in the paediatric population is very low, estimated at less than 0.1%, making it an unlikely cause of headaches in a 9-year-old boy.",

            "<b>Urgent referral to paediatric surgery</b> is the correct management. This infant has a clinically obvious inguinal hernia. Inguinal hernias in infants are due to a patent processus vaginalis, which allows abdominal contents to protrude into the inguinal canal. The key factor dictating management is the patient's age. Infants, particularly those under 6 months of age, have a very high risk (up to 30%) of the hernia becoming irreducible (incarcerated) and having its blood supply compromised (strangulated). Strangulation is a surgical emergency that can lead to bowel necrosis, sepsis, and testicular infarction. Therefore, to prevent these life-threatening complications, the standard of care in the UK is to perform a herniotomy urgently, typically within days of diagnosis, even if the hernia is currently reducible and the infant is asymptomatic. An urgent referral to the on-call paediatric surgical team is mandatory.<br /><br /><b>Elective referral to paediatric surgery</b> is incorrect. While this is the appropriate management for an uncomplicated inguinal hernia in a child over the age of one, it is not safe for an infant. The risk of incarceration and strangulation is significantly lower in older children, allowing for a planned, elective surgical repair. In a 6-week-old, the risk is unacceptably high, and waiting for a routine outpatient appointment would place the infant in significant danger. The distinction in urgency based on age is a critical concept in paediatric surgery. Delaying referral in this case would be a serious clinical error.<br /><br /><b>Reassure and review in 4 weeks</b> would be inappropriate and dangerous. This approach might be considered for other common, self-limiting groin swellings in infancy, such as a simple hydrocele, which often resolves spontaneously. However, the history of an intermittent swelling that appears with increased intra-abdominal pressure (crying) and is reducible on examination is characteristic of an inguinal hernia, not a hydrocele. Inguinal hernias do not resolve spontaneously. Adopting a 'watch and wait' strategy would fail to address the underlying anatomical defect and expose the infant to the high risk of strangulation.<br /><br /><b>Refer for an urgent ultrasound scan</b> is not the most appropriate next step. While ultrasound is a useful tool for evaluating groin lumps where there is diagnostic uncertainty, it is not required in this case. The clinical history and examination findings are pathognomonic for a reducible inguinal hernia. Requesting an ultrasound would introduce an unnecessary delay to definitive management. The priority for this 6-week-old infant is prompt surgical assessment to mitigate the high risk of incarceration. The clinical diagnosis is sufficient to warrant an immediate referral to paediatric surgery.<br /><br /><b>Advise conservative management until 1 year of age</b> is incorrect.

            "The correct answer is phenoxymethylpenicillin for 10 days. This child is presenting with the classic signs and symptoms of acute tonsillitis: fever, sore throat and cervical lymphadenopathy. He is scoring 3 out of 4 on the Centor criteria (+1 for fever, +1 for the absence of cough and +1 for anterior cervical lymphadenopathy). This score indicates that the infection is likely to be bacterial rather than viral, requiring antibiotics. Hence, the first-line antibiotic to prescribe is phenoxymethylpenicillin. Antibiotics are of vital importance in acute bacterial tonsillitis, as it could develop into quinsy, a potentially deadly complication. <br /><br />Analgesia and abundant fluid administration are suggested in cases of mononucleosis (Epstein-Barr virus). The classic triad of sore throat, pyrexia and lymphadenopathy is seen in around 98% of cases of mononucleosis, but in this case, the patient also has enlarged tonsils. Additionally, mononucleosis is most commonly found in adolescents and not children, making this diagnosis and management unlikely. <br /><br />Amoxicillin for 5 days is prescribed in cases of otitis media. The most defining characteristic of otitis media is otalgia, which is absent in this patient making this diagnosis and management unlikely. <br /><br />Analgesia and come back in 5 days for review is an incorrect answer. Antibiotic treatment should be given immediately if the patient is scoring 3 or more on the Centor criteria. If not given in bacterial tonsillitis, it can develop into a dangerous peritonsillar abscess. <br /><br />Erythromycin for 10 days is wrong since this antibiotic is used as a second-line treatment in cases where phenoxymethylpenicillin cannot be used. In this case, there are no contraindications for the usage of the first-line treatment.",
