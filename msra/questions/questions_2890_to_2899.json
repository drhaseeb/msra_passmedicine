            "The correct answer is <b>Necrobiosis lipoidica diabeticorum</b>. This condition is a rare skin disorder of unclear etiology and is more common in patients with diabetes, though it can also occur in non-diabetics. The characteristic clinical presentation includes shiny plaques on the anterior aspect of the lower legs that are yellowish-brown with telangiectasias and atrophic skin. The plaques may be asymptomatic or painful and usually start as small papules that slowly enlarge.<br /><br /><b>Pretibial myxoedema</b> is incorrect. This condition is associated with Graves' disease, an autoimmune thyroid disorder. It presents as non-pitting edema on the shins and feet. The skin appears waxy or doughy but not shiny or yellow.<br /><br /><b>Erythema nodosum</b> is also incorrect. Erythema nodosum presents as painful, red, raised nodules typically located symmetrically on the anterior surface of the lower legs. It does not cause shiny, painless areas of yellow skin.<br /><br /><b>Pyoderma gangrenosum</b> is another incorrect option. Pyoderma gangrenosum usually presents as a rapidly growing painful ulcer with a purulent base and violaceous borders, often associated with systemic diseases like inflammatory bowel disease or rheumatoid arthritis.<br /><br />Lastly, <b>Syphilis</b> would be an incorrect diagnosis for this patient's presentation. Secondary syphilis may present with a variety of skin manifestations including a symmetrical rash often involving palms and soles, mucous patches in the mouth or genital area, condyloma lata (large grey-white lesions), but not typically shiny yellow plaques over the shin area seen in this case scenario.<br />",

        "question": "A 32-year-old man presents to the emergency department with reduced vision in his left eye. He says that he first noticed it around 6 hours ago and that he's in pain, especially when he moves his eye. He also describes that everything 'looks a funny colour'.<br /><br />Upon performing the swinging light there is a normal constriction of both pupils when the light is shone into the right eye. When the light is shone into the left eye there is a reduced constriction of both pupils. <br /><br />Which disease most commonly causes this man's presentation?",

            "The correct answer is <b>Topical atropine</b>. Topical atropine is not a recognised treatment for hyperhidrosis according to UK guidelines. Atropine works by blocking the action of acetylcholine, a neurotransmitter involved in sweat production. However, its use as a topical treatment for hyperhidrosis is limited due to significant side effects like blurred vision and dry mouth.<br /><br /><b>Endoscopic transthoracic sympathectomy</b> is an invasive surgical procedure used as a last resort in severe cases of hyperhidrosis that have not responded to other treatments. It involves cutting or clamping the sympathetic nerves that control sweating. While effective, it carries risks such as compensatory sweating (increased sweating elsewhere on the body), Horner's syndrome and pneumothorax.<br /><br /><b>Iontophoresis</b> is a non-invasive treatment option typically used for palmoplantar hyperhidrosis (excessive sweating of the hands and feet). It involves passing a weak electric current through water to the skin surface which helps to block sweat glands temporarily.<br /><br /><b>Topical aluminium chloride</b>, often in the form of antiperspirants, is usually the first-line therapy for mild-to-moderate hyperhidrosis. Aluminium salts precipitate with mucopolysaccharides, obstructing the ducts of apocrine and eccrine sweat glands leading to decreased sweating.<br /><br /><b>Botulinum toxin</b> injections are another therapeutic option for localised hyperhidrosis such as axillary (underarms), palmar (hands) or plantar (feet) when topical treatments fail. Botulinum toxin inhibits release of acetylcholine from nerve endings thereby reducing sweat secretion.<br />",
