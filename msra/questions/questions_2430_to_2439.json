            "<b>Amoxicillin 500\u202fmg three times daily for 7 days</b> is correct because amoxicillin is a safe and effective treatment for <i>Chlamydia trachomatis</i> in pregnancy. It is well tolerated and does not carry teratogenic risks. This patient is in her first trimester and has a confirmed infection. Treating promptly is important to reduce the risk of miscarriage, preterm birth, and neonatal complications. Amoxicillin is a suitable option given her allergy to azithromycin and should be commenced immediately.<br /><br /><b>Clarithromycin 500\u202fmg twice daily for 7 days</b> is incorrect because clarithromycin is not routinely recommended for the treatment of <i>Chlamydia trachomatis</i> in pregnancy. It has been associated with potential teratogenicity in animal studies, and there is limited safety data in pregnant women. Safer alternatives exist, and current guidance does not support the use of clarithromycin in this context.<br /><br /><b>Co-amoxiclav 625\u202fmg three times daily for 7 days</b> is incorrect because although it contains amoxicillin, which is effective against Chlamydia trachomatis, the addition of clavulanic acid is unnecessary and not recommended for this indication. Co-amoxiclav is generally reserved for infections involving beta-lactamase\u2013producing organisms. Using broader-spectrum antibiotics unnecessarily increases the risk of side effects, such as gastrointestinal upset, and promotes antimicrobial resistance. In pregnancy, narrower-spectrum agents like amoxicillin alone are preferred when effective, making co-amoxiclav an inappropriate first-line choice in this setting.<br /><br /><b>Levofloxacin 500\u202fmg once daily for 7 days</b> is incorrect because although it is active against Chlamydia trachomatis, it is not recommended in pregnancy due to concerns about effects on developing cartilage and musculoskeletal toxicity. Fluoroquinolones are generally avoided in pregnant women unless no safer alternatives are available. NICE guidelines recommend azithromycin, erythromycin, or amoxicillin as first-line options for treating chlamydia in pregnancy. Levofloxacin would pose unnecessary risk to the foetus and is not an appropriate choice in this context.<br /><br /><b>Metronidazole 400\u202fmg three times daily for 5 days</b> is incorrect because metronidazole is not effective against <i>Chlamydia trachomatis</i>. It is used to treat infections such as bacterial vaginosis and trichomoniasis, but it has no activity against chlamydial organisms.

            "<b>Gonioscopy</b> is the correct answer. This patient presents with classical features of acute angle-closure glaucoma (AACG): severe ocular pain, blurred vision, halos around lights, corneal oedema (hazy cornea), and a semi-dilated sluggishly reactive pupil. The symptoms were precipitated by watching television in a dark room, which causes pupillary dilatation\u2014a known precipitant of AACG. When AACG is suspected, both tonometry and gonioscopy are essential investigations. Tonometry measures the intraocular pressure (IOP), which will be elevated in AACG. Gonioscopy uses a special lens on the slit lamp to directly visualise the anterior chamber angle, allowing confirmation that the angle is closed and distinguishing between angle-closure and open-angle mechanisms. This distinction is crucial as it determines the appropriate management pathway. In AACG, gonioscopy will reveal a closed angle with iris-trabecular contact. Both investigations should be performed urgently before initiating emergency medical treatment with topical medications (pilocarpine, beta-blockers, alpha-2 agonists) and intravenous acetazolamide, followed by definitive laser peripheral iridotomy once the acute attack settles.<br /><br /><b>Fundoscopy</b> is not the priority investigation in suspected AACG. Whilst fundoscopy may eventually reveal optic disc changes in chronic glaucoma or cupping, it does not help diagnose the acute condition or differentiate between angle-closure and open-angle mechanisms. The corneal oedema present in AACG often makes adequate fundoscopy difficult or impossible during the acute presentation. The immediate priority is to confirm the diagnosis through tonometry and gonioscopy, and to initiate treatment to lower the IOP and prevent permanent optic nerve damage.<br /><br /><b>Fluorescein staining</b> is used to identify corneal epithelial defects such as abrasions, ulcers, or dendritic ulcers in herpes simplex keratitis. Whilst this patient has a red eye, the constellation of symptoms\u2014severe pain, halos, semi-dilated pupil, and hazy cornea\u2014points towards AACG rather than a corneal surface problem. In AACG, the corneal haziness is due to oedema from elevated IOP rather than epithelial damage. Fluorescein staining would not help diagnose or manage AACG and would delay appropriate treatment.<br /><br /><b>Optical coherence tomography</b> (OCT) is a non-invasive imaging technique that provides cross-sectional images of the retina and optic nerve head. It is valuable for assessing retinal pathology and monitoring glaucomatous optic nerve damage over time. However, OCT is not an appropriate initial investigation for suspected AACG. It does not measure IOP, does not visualise the anterior chamber angle, and would significantly delay the urgent diagnosis and treatment required in this ophthalmic emergency. OCT may have a role in follow-up assessment of optic nerve damage after the acute episode has been managed.<br /><br /><b>Visual field testing</b> assesses peripheral and central vision and is used to detect and monitor glaucomatous visual field defects over time. Perimetry is important in the long-term management of glaucoma but is not an appropriate investigation during an acute presentation of AACG. The patient is in severe pain with reduced visual acuity, making reliable visual field testing impossible. Furthermore, visual field testing does not diagnose AACG, measure IOP, or visualise the angle. The priority is immediate confirmation of diagnosis through tonometry and gonioscopy, followed by urgent treatment to prevent irreversible vision loss.",

The symptoms were precipitated by watching television in a dark room, which causes pupillary dilatation\u2014a known precipitant of AACG. When AACG is suspected, both tonometry and gonioscopy are essential investigations. Tonometry measures the intraocular pressure (IOP), which will be elevated in AACG. Gonioscopy uses a special lens on the slit lamp to directly visualise the anterior chamber angle, allowing confirmation that the angle is closed and distinguishing between angle-closure and open-angle mechanisms. This distinction is crucial as it determines the appropriate management pathway. In AACG, gonioscopy will reveal a closed angle with iris-trabecular contact. Both investigations should be performed urgently before initiating emergency medical treatment with topical medications (pilocarpine, beta-blockers, alpha-2 agonists) and intravenous acetazolamide, followed by definitive laser peripheral iridotomy once the acute attack settles.<br /><br /><b>Fundoscopy</b> is not the priority investigation in suspected AACG. Whilst fundoscopy may eventually reveal optic disc changes in chronic glaucoma or cupping, it does not help diagnose the acute condition or differentiate between angle-closure and open-angle mechanisms. The corneal oedema present in AACG often makes adequate fundoscopy difficult or impossible during the acute presentation. The immediate priority is to confirm the diagnosis through tonometry and gonioscopy, and to initiate treatment to lower the IOP and prevent permanent optic nerve damage.<br /><br /><b>Fluorescein staining</b> is used to identify corneal epithelial defects such as abrasions, ulcers, or dendritic ulcers in herpes simplex keratitis. Whilst this patient has a red eye, the constellation of symptoms\u2014severe pain, halos, semi-dilated pupil, and hazy cornea\u2014points towards AACG rather than a corneal surface problem. In AACG, the corneal haziness is due to oedema from elevated IOP rather than epithelial damage. Fluorescein staining would not help diagnose or manage AACG and would delay appropriate treatment.<br /><br /><b>Optical coherence tomography</b> (OCT) is a non-invasive imaging technique that provides cross-sectional images of the retina and optic nerve head. It is valuable for assessing retinal pathology and monitoring glaucomatous optic nerve damage over time. However, OCT is not an appropriate initial investigation for suspected AACG. It does not measure IOP, does not visualise the anterior chamber angle, and would significantly delay the urgent diagnosis and treatment required in this ophthalmic emergency. OCT may have a role in follow-up assessment of optic nerve damage after the acute episode has been managed.<br /><br /><b>Visual field testing</b> assesses peripheral and central vision and is used to detect and monitor glaucomatous visual field defects over time. Perimetry is important in the long-term management of glaucoma but is not an appropriate investigation during an acute presentation of AACG. The patient is in severe pain with reduced visual acuity, making reliable visual field testing impossible. Furthermore, visual field testing does not diagnose AACG, measure IOP, or visualise the angle. The priority is immediate confirmation of diagnosis through tonometry and gonioscopy, followed by urgent treatment to prevent irreversible vision loss.",

            "This patient has a likely diagnosis of glandular fever, a viral illness usually caused by the Ebstein-Barr virus. Symptoms include a sore throat, fever, and general malaise. On examination, it is common to see palpable cervical lymphadenopathy and an erythematous throat. In the later stages of the illness, splenomegaly may appear. It is more common in teenagers and is commonly spread via respiratory droplets and has been nicknamed the 'kissing disease'. This child was given a course of antibiotics by his general practitioner. In patients with glandular fever, if amoxicillin is given, a non-specific maculopapular rash appears over the skin. Glandular fever is diagnosed by the Monospot test, a blood test that detects the presence of heterophil antibodies made following infection with Ebstein-Barr virus.<br /><br />An anti-streptolysin O titre is used to detect the presence of a streptococcal infection secondary to group A streptococcal bacteria such as <i>Streptococcus pyogenes</i>. Group A streptococcal infections commonly cause bacterial tonsillitis which can initially be virtually indistinguishable from glandular fever. However, it does not explain his maculopapular rash following antibiotic use.<br /><br />A full blood count can be useful in helping aid a diagnosis, particularly glandular fever where a full blood count will demonstrate a lymphocytosis. However, a monospot blood test is more diagnostic of glandular fever, which makes it the correct answer.<br /><br />A nasopharyngeal aspirate (NPA) for viral polymerase chain reaction (PCR) can be useful for diagnosing viral infections such as measles. Measles would also account for a history of coryza and maculopapular rash. However, measles is less common in the UK following the introduction of the measles, mumps, and rubella vaccination. It is also less likely in a teenager. A NPA is not routinely used in diagnosing glandular fever.<br /><br />A sputum culture has no role in diagnosing glandular fever.

However, higher socioeconomic groups show a higher incidence of infectious mononucleosis, as acquiring EBV in adolescence or early adulthood results in symptomatic disease.",

NICE guidelines clearly state that for women with pre-existing diabetes, all oral hypoglycaemic agents should be stopped except metformin, and insulin should be commenced. This is because most oral agents cross the placenta and may cause fetal hypoglycaemia or other adverse effects. Metformin is considered safe in pregnancy and can be continued alongside insulin.

Simply monitoring without changing medication puts both mother and fetus at risk.<br /><br /><b>Stop metformin and continue gliclazide</b> is the opposite of recommended practice.
