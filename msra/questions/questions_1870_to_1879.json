        "title": "Hyperlipidaemia: management",
        "body": "In 2014 NICE updated their guidelines on lipid modification. This proved highly controversial as it meant that we should be recommending statins to a significant proportion of the population over the age of 60 years. Anyway, the key points of the new guidelines are summarised below.<br /><br /><CENTER><table><tr><td align = 'left' colspan='2'><a data-fancybox class='fancybox' rel='group' href='https://d32xxyeh8kfs8k.cloudfront.net/images_Passmedicine/pdd915b.png'><img class='ajaximage' src='https://d32xxyeh8kfs8k.cloudfront.net/images_Passmedicine/pdd915.png'/></a></td></tr><tr><td valign='top' align='left'></td><td align='right'><a data-fancybox class='fancybox lbmagglasslink' rel='group' href='https://d32xxyeh8kfs8k.cloudfront.net/images_Passmedicine/pdd915b.png'><img src='https://d32xxyeh8kfs8k.cloudfront.net/css/images/mag_glass.png'/></a></td></tr></table></CENTER><div class='imagetext'>Graphic showing choice of statin.</div><br /><h5 class='notes-heading'>Primary prevention - who and how to assess risk</h5><br />A systematic strategy should be used to identify people aged over 40 years who are likely to be at high risk of cardiovascular disease (CVD), defined as a 10-year risk of <b>10%</b> or greater. <br /><br />NICE recommend we use the <b>QRISK2</b> CVD risk assessment tool for patients aged <= 84 years. Patients >= 85 years are at high risk of CVD due to their age. QRISK2 should not be used in the following situations as there are more specific guidelines for these patient groups:<br /><ul><li>type 1 diabetics</li><li>patients with an estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) less than 60 ml/min and/or albuminuria</li><li>patients with a history of familial hyperlipidaemia</li></ul><br />NICE suggest QRISK2 may underestimate CVD risk in the following population groups:<br /><ul><li>people treated for HIV</li><li>people with serious mental health problems</li><li>people taking medicines that can cause dyslipidaemia such as antipsychotics, corticosteroids or immunosuppressant drugs</li><li>people with autoimmune disorders/systemic inflammatory disorders such as systemic lupus erythematosus</li></ul><br /><br /><h5 class='notes-heading'>Measuring lipid levels</h5><br />When measuring lipids both the total cholesterol and HDL should be checked to provide the most accurate risk of CVD. A full lipid profile should also be checked (i.e. including triglycerides) before starting a statin. The samples do not need to be fasting.<br /><br />In the vast majority of patients the cholesterol measurements will be fed into the QRISK2 tool. If however, the patient's cholesterol is very high we should consider familial hyperlipidaemia. NICE recommend the following that we should consider the possibility of familial hypercholesterolaemia and investigate further if:<br /><ul><li>the total cholesterol level greater than 7.5 mmol/L and/or</li><li>there is a personal or family history of premature coronary heart disease (an event before 60 years in an index person or first-degree relative [parents, siblings, children])</li></ul><br /><br /><h5 class='notes-heading'>Interpreting the QRISK2 result</h5><br />Probably the headline change in the 2014 guidelines was the new, lower cut-off of 10-year CVD risk cut-off of 10%. <br /><br /><h5 class='notes-heading'>NICE now recommend we offer a statin to people with a QRISK2 10-year risk of >= 10%</h5><br />Lifestyle factors are of course important and NICE recommend that we give patients the option of having their CVD risk reassessed after a period of time before starting a statin.<br /><br />Atorvastatin 20mg should be offered first-line.<br /><br /><br /><h5 class='notes-heading'>Special situations</h5><br />Type 1 diabetes mellitus<br /><ul><li>NICE recommend that we 'consider statin treatment for the primary prevention of CVD in all adults with type 1 diabetes'</li><li>atorvastatin 20 mg should be offered if type 1 diabetics who are:<ul><li>older than 40 years, or</li><li>have had diabetes for more than 10 years or</li><li>have established nephropathy or</li><li>have other CVD risk factors</li></ul></li></ul><br />Chronic kidney disease (CKD)<br /><ul><li>atorvastatin 20mg should be offered to patients with CKD</li><li>increase the dose if a greater than 40% reduction in non-HDL cholesterol is not achieved and the eGFR > 30 ml/min.

            "A cephalohaematoma appears as a swelling due to bleeding between the periosteum and the skull.  It is most commonly noted in the parietal region and is associated with instrumental deliveries.  The swelling usually appears 2-3 days following delivery and does not cross suture lines.  It gradually resolves over a number of weeks.<br /><br />Caput succadeneum is commonly seen in newborns immediately after birth.  It occurs due to generalised superficial scalp oedema, which crosses suture lines.  It is associated with prolonged labour and will rapidly resolve over a couple of days.<br /><br />Subaponeurotic haematoma is a rare condition where bleeding occurs that is not bound by the periosteum.  It can be life threatening and presents as a fluctuant scalp swelling, which is not limited by suture lines.<br /><br />Craniosynostosis is uncommon and is where there is premature closure of cranial sutures, causing deformity of the skull.  It can be evident at birth and may be associated with genetic syndromes.  The shape of the skull will depend upon which sutures are involved.  Other clinical features include early closure of the anterior fontanelle and raised ridge along the fused suture.",

        "question": "A 2 day old baby who was born by a ventouse delivery is noted to have a swelling on the left side of his head in the parietal region.  His head appeared normal immediately after delivery.  On examination, the baby is well and the swelling does not cross suture lines.  The fontanelles and sutures appear normal.  What is the most likely diagnosis?",
        "correct_answer": "5",
        "question_notes": "A cephalohaematoma appears as a swelling due to bleeding between the periosteum and the skull.  It is most commonly noted in the parietal region and is associated with instrumental deliveries.  The swelling usually appears 2-3 days following delivery and does not cross suture lines.  It gradually resolves over a number of weeks.<br /><br />Caput succadeneum is commonly seen in newborns immediately after birth.  It occurs due to generalised superficial scalp oedema, which crosses suture lines.  It is associated with prolonged labour and will rapidly resolve over a couple of days.<br /><br />Subaponeurotic haematoma is a rare condition where bleeding occurs that is not bound by the periosteum.  It can be life threatening and presents as a fluctuant scalp swelling, which is not limited by suture lines.<br /><br />Craniosynostosis is uncommon and is where there is premature closure of cranial sutures, causing deformity of the skull.  It can be evident at birth and may be associated with genetic syndromes.  The shape of the skull will depend upon which sutures are involved.  Other clinical features include early closure of the anterior fontanelle and raised ridge along the fused suture.",

It consists of AFP, -HCG and oestriol blood tests.",

            "The correct answer is to stop atorvastatin before trying to conceive. Statins are contraindicated during pregnancy as they cross the placental barrier and may cause foetal harm. There is evidence that statins can interfere with cholesterol-dependent embryonic development and may be teratogenic. Guidelines recommend discontinuing statins at least 3 months before planned conception and throughout pregnancy. The benefits of treating hypercholesterolaemia during pregnancy do not outweigh the potential risks to the developing foetus.<br /><br /><b>Switch to atorvastatin 10mg</b> is incorrect because changing the dose of atorvastatin does not address the fundamental issue that statins should be avoided in pregnancy and when trying to conceive. The risk of foetal harm exists regardless of the dose.<br /><br /><b>Continue current drug at same dose</b> is incorrect as maintaining atorvastatin 80mg would expose the developing foetus to potentially harmful effects. High-dose statin therapy during pregnancy poses an unnecessary risk.<br /><br /><b>Switch to ezetimibe</b> is incorrect because, although ezetimibe works through a different mechanism than statins, it is also not recommended during pregnancy. There is insufficient safety data regarding its use in pregnancy, and it should be avoided.<br /><br /><b>Switch to simvastatin 40mg</b> is incorrect as changing to a different statin does not resolve the contraindication. All statins are contraindicated in pregnancy and when trying to conceive due to their potential teratogenic effects.<br /><br />For women with familial hypercholesterolaemia who are planning pregnancy, the focus should be on non-pharmacological management during pregnancy, including dietary modification and lifestyle changes.

            "<b>Slipped upper femoral epiphysis (SUFE)</b> is the correct diagnosis in this case. The clinical presentation strongly suggests SUFE with several key features: an adolescent male who is obese (a significant risk factor), pain in the thigh (which can be referred from the hip), and pain worse with activity. The examination finding of limited and painful internal rotation of the hip whilst maintaining flexion is particularly characteristic of SUFE. The condition occurs when the femoral head displaces from the femoral neck at the growth plate, typically during periods of rapid growth.<br /><br /><b>Transient synovitis</b> is incorrect because it typically affects younger children (aged 3-8 years), presents more acutely, and is often preceded by an upper respiratory tract infection. Additionally, patients with transient synovitis usually refuse to bear weight and have more generalised limitation of hip movement, not just internal rotation.<br /><br /><b>Perthes disease</b> is incorrect as it typically affects younger children (aged 4-8 years) and is more common in thin, active boys rather than those who are obese. While it can present with similar symptoms, the age of this patient makes Perthes disease much less likely.<br /><br /><b>Trochanteric bursitis</b> is incorrect because the pain would be localised to the lateral hip region over the greater trochanter, rather than the thigh. Additionally, trochanteric bursitis is uncommon in adolescents and would not cause the specific limitation of internal rotation seen in this case.<br /><br /><b>Medial collateral ligament strain</b> is incorrect as this would cause pain specifically localised to the medial aspect of the knee joint. The pain would be worse with valgus stress to the knee, and there would be no limitation of hip movement. The history of hip movement restriction makes this diagnosis unlikely.",
