If the stroke is ischaemic, and certain criteria are met, the patient should be offered <span class=\"concept\" data-cid=\"7966\">thrombolysis</span>. Example criteria include:<br /><ul><li>patients present with 4.5 hours of onset of stroke symptoms</li><li>the patient has not had a previous intracranial haemorrhage, uncontrolled hypertension, pregnant etc</li></ul><br />Once haemorrhagic stroke has been excluded patients should be given aspirin 300mg as soon as possible and antiplatelet therapy should be continued.<br /><br /><h5 class='notes-heading'>Transient ischaemic attacks</h5><br />Remember with TIAs the, by definition, symptoms last less than 24 hours although in the vast majority of cases the duration is much shorter, typically 1 hour or so. For this reason most patients symptoms will have resolved before they see a doctor.<br /><br />The ABCD2 prognostic score has previously been used to risk stratify patients who present with a suspected TIA. However, data from studies have suggested it performs poorly and it is therefore no longer recommended. Instead, NICE recommend:<br /><br />Immediate antithrombotic therapy:<br /><ul><li>give aspirin 300 mg immediately, unless contraindicated e.g. the patient has a bleeding disorder or is taking an anticoagulant (needs immediate admission for imaging to exclude a haemorrhage)</li></ul><br />If the patient has had more than 1 TIA ('crescendo TIA') or has a suspected cardioembolic source or severe carotid stenosis:<br /><ul><li>discuss the need for admission or observation urgently with a stroke specialist</li></ul><br />If the patient has had a suspected TIA in the last 7 days:<br /><ul><li>arrange urgent assessment (within 24 hours) by a specialist stroke physician</li></ul><br />If the patient has had a suspected TIA which occurred more than a week previously:<br /><ul><li>refer for specialist assessment as soon as possible within 7 days</li></ul><br /><h5 class='notes-heading'>Haemorrhagic strokes</h5><br />If imaging confirms a haemorrhagic stroke neurosurgical consultation should be considered for advice on further management. The vast majority of patients however are not suitable for surgical intervention. Management is therefore supportive as per haemorrhagic stroke. Anticoagulants (e.g. warfarin) and antithrombotic medications (e.g. clopidogrel) should be stopped to minimise further bleeding. If a patient is anticoagulated this should be reversed as quickly as possible. Trials have shown improved outcomes in patients who have their blood pressure lowered acutely and this is now part of many protocols for haemorrhagic strokes.",

            "The most likely diagnosis in this case is <b>lateral epicondylitis</b>, also known as tennis elbow. This condition is characterized by pain and tenderness over the lateral epicondyle of the humerus, which is aggravated by wrist extension against resistance with the elbow extended. The patient's presentation of pain in the right elbow without an obvious trigger and positive findings on examination are consistent with lateral epicondylitis.<br /><br /><b>Cubital tunnel syndrome</b> is caused by compression of the ulnar nerve at the level of the elbow, leading to symptoms such as numbness and tingling in the ring and little fingers, as well as weakness in hand grip. However, this patient does not report any sensory or motor symptoms, making cubital tunnel syndrome less likely.<br /><br /><b>Carpal tunnel syndrome</b> results from compression of the median nerve at the level of the wrist. Symptoms typically include numbness, tingling, and pain in the thumb, index finger, middle finger, and half of the ring finger. Patients may also experience nocturnal symptoms that are relieved by shaking their hands. The absence of these specific symptoms makes carpal tunnel syndrome an unlikely diagnosis for this patient.<br /><br /><b>Medial epicondylitis</b>, or golfer's elbow, involves pain and tenderness over the medial epicondyle of the humerus. Pain is usually elicited by resisted wrist flexion with pronation while keeping the elbow flexed 90 degrees or resisted forearm pronation with the elbow extended. Since this patient reports pain on wrist extension rather than flexion or pronation, medial epicondylitis is not a likely diagnosis.<br /><br />Finally, <b>pronator syndrome</b> occurs due to entrapment of the median nerve between two heads of the pronator teres muscle or under the fibrous arch formed by flexor digitorum superficialis muscle leading to pain in the proximal forearm and sometimes paresthesia in the median nerve distribution. However, this patient's symptoms are more localized to the elbow and are aggravated by wrist extension, making pronator syndrome less likely.<br /><br />In conclusion, based on the patient's presentation and examination findings, lateral epicondylitis is the most likely diagnosis.",

            "The correct answer is <b>Sebaceous cyst</b>. Sebaceous cysts are benign skin lesions that arise from the sebaceous glands, often presenting as slow-growing, painless lumps located anywhere on the body. They can be single or multiple and are filled with keratinous material. The location above the eye and the duration of two years without significant changes in size or symptoms point towards this diagnosis.<br /><br /><b>Dacryocystitis</b> is an infection of the lacrimal sac, typically causing redness, swelling, and pain in the inner corner of the eye. It may also present with epiphora (excessive tearing) and purulent discharge. This patient's lump is not located in the inner corner of his eye, which makes dacryocystitis a less likely diagnosis.<br /><br /><b>Basal cell carcinoma</b> is a type of skin cancer that commonly occurs on sun-exposed areas like the face. Although it can appear as a bump or growth, basal cell carcinoma usually presents as a pearly nodule with telangiectasia (small dilated blood vessels), or as an ulcer with rolled edges that fails to heal. The lack of these characteristic features in this patient makes basal cell carcinoma unlikely.<br /><br />A <b>Chalazion</b>, or meibomian gland lipogranuloma, typically presents as a firm lump within the eyelid itself rather than above it. It results from obstruction of meibomian glands leading to lipid accumulation and granuloma formation. While chalazions can persist for long periods, they are usually located within the tarsal plate of the eyelid rather than above it.<br /><br />Finally, a <b>Hordeolum externum</b>, or external stye, is an acute infection usually caused by <i>Staphylococcus aureus</i>. It presents as a painful red bump at the edge of the eyelid and tends to resolve spontaneously within one week. The duration and appearance of this patient's lesion do not align with those typical for a hordeolum externum.<br />",

            "The correct answer is <b>Loss of inhibitions</b>. Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD) is a mental health condition triggered by experiencing or witnessing a terrifying event. Its symptoms are generally grouped into four types: intrusive memories, avoidance, negative changes in thinking and mood, and changes in physical and emotional reactions (hyperarousal). Loss of inhibitions is not typically associated with PTSD. It refers to the inability to control one's impulses or behaviour, which can be seen in conditions such as mania or certain personality disorders.<br /><br /><b>Hyperarousal</b>, on the other hand, is a characteristic feature of PTSD. This term refers to the state of being constantly on guard for threats, leading to restlessness, sleep disturbances and difficulty concentrating. It represents the body's heightened response to fear and stress.<br /><br /><b>Emotional numbing</b> also occurs in PTSD. This involves feeling detached from others and emotionally unresponsive. Individuals may lose interest in activities they once enjoyed and find it difficult to experience positive emotions.<br /><br />Nightmares are part of the <b>Intrusive memories</b> symptom category of PTSD. They involve recurrent, unwanted distressing dreams about the traumatic event. These nightmares can significantly disrupt sleep patterns and contribute to fear and anxiety.<br /><br />Lastly, <b>Avoidance</b> is another key feature of PTSD where individuals will actively avoid places, people or thoughts that remind them of the traumatic event as these triggers could cause distressing memories or flashbacks.<br /><br />In conclusion, while hyperarousal, emotional numbing, nightmares and avoidance are all characteristic features of post-traumatic stress disorder according to DSM-5 criteria; loss of inhibitions isn't typically associated with this condition.<br />",

            "The correct answer is <b>FVC - reduced, FEV1/FVC - normal</b>. Pulmonary fibrosis is a restrictive lung disease characterised by scarring of the lung tissue which results in decreased lung compliance and capacity. The key spirometry findings in restrictive lung diseases are a reduced Forced Vital Capacity (FVC) due to the decreased lung compliance and a normal or increased ratio of Forced Expiratory Volume in 1 second (FEV1) to FVC because both parameters decrease proportionally.<br /><br /><b>FEV1 - reduced, FEV1/FVC - reduced</b> represents an obstructive pattern rather than a restrictive one.
