            "An acoustic neuroma (or vestibular schwannoma) is a benign tumour of the vestibulocochlear nerve. Symptoms include vertigo, tinnitus and unilateral sensorineural hearing loss. This patient's hearing tests demonstrate a left-sided sensorineural hearing loss. Through invasion of the trigeminal nerve, patients may also present with an absent corneal reflex, as seen here.<br /><br />A cholesteatoma is a growth of keratinised epithelium in the middle ear. It commonly presents with conductive hearing loss in the affected ear. In later stages of the disease, a disturbance in balance and vertigo can present. However, this patient has a sensorineural hearing loss, making a cholesteatoma unlikely.<br /><br />Labyrinthitis is a viral inner ear infection that causes sensorineural hearing loss and vertigo. Vertigo in labyrinthitis comes on acutely and tends to be more prolonged and persistent in the first few days before it begins to ease. In some cases, rest cannot take away the sensation of vertigo. It would not be the cause of the loss of the corneal reflex.<br /><br />Meniere's disease typically presents as a triad of tinnitus, vertigo and sensorineural hearing loss. Vertigo tends to last for minutes-hours at a time, and the disease follows a relapsing and remitting course. A sensation of fullness in the ear is also a common feature.<br /><br />Otosclerosis is a common cause of hearing loss, most frequently in younger women. The disease presents as a progressive, bilateral conductive hearing loss. Vertigo and the loss of the corneal reflex are not symptoms of otosclerosis and given the unilateral presentation of this patient's symptoms, otosclerosis is unlikely.",
