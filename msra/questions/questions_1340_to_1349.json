        "body": "NICE published updated guidelines for the management of hypertension in 2019. This builds on the significant guidelines released in 2011 that recommended:<br /><ul><li>classifying hypertension into stages</li><li>recommending the use of <span class=\"concept\" data-cid=\"547\">ambulatory blood pressure monitoring (ABPM)</span> and home blood pressure monitoring (HBPM)</li></ul><br /><br /><CENTER><table><tr><td align = 'left' colspan='2'><a data-fancybox class='fancybox' rel='group' href='https://d32xxyeh8kfs8k.cloudfront.net/images_Passmedicine/pdd927b.png'><img class='ajaximage' src='https://d32xxyeh8kfs8k.cloudfront.net/images_Passmedicine/pdd927.png'/></a></td></tr><tr><td valign='top' align='left'></td><td align='right'><a data-fancybox class='fancybox lbmagglasslink' rel='group' href='https://d32xxyeh8kfs8k.cloudfront.net/images_Passmedicine/pdd927b.png'><img src='https://d32xxyeh8kfs8k.cloudfront.net/css/images/mag_glass.png'/></a></td></tr></table></CENTER><div class='imagetext'>Flow chart showing simplified schematic for diagnosis hypertension following NICE guidelines</div><br /><br /><h5 class='notes-heading'>Why were these guidelines needed?</h5><br />It has long been recognised by doctors that there is a subgroup of patients whose blood pressure climbs 20 mmHg whenever they enter a clinical setting, so called 'white coat hypertension'. If we just rely on clinic readings then such patients may be diagnosed as having hypertension when, the vast majority of the time, their blood pressure is normal.<br /><br />This has led to the use of both ambulatory blood pressure monitoring (ABPM) and home blood pressure monitoring (HBPM) to confirm the diagnosis of hypertension. These techniques allow a more accurate assessment of a patients' overall blood pressure. Not only does this help prevent overdiagnosis of hypertension - ABPM has been shown to be a more accurate predictor of cardiovascular events than clinic readings.<br /><br /><h5 class='notes-heading'>Blood pressure classification</h5><br />This becomes relevant later in some of the management decisions that NICE advocate.<br /><br /><div class=\"table-responsive\"><table class = \"tlarge table table-striped table-bordered\"  data-role=\"table\" id=\"tableid1\" ><thead><tr><th><b>Stage</b></th><th><b>Criteria</b></th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td><b>Stage 1 hypertension</b></td><td>Clinic BP >= 140/90 mmHg and subsequent ABPM daytime average or HBPM average BP >= 135/85 mmHg</td></tr><tr><td><b>Stage 2 hypertension</b></td><td>Clinic BP >= 160/100 mmHg and subsequent ABPM daytime average or HBPM average BP >= 150/95 mmHg</td></tr><tr><td><b>Severe hypertension</b></td><td>Clinic systolic BP >= 180 mmHg, or clinic diastolic BP >= 120 mmHg</td></tr></tbody></table></div><br /><h5 class='notes-heading'>Diagnosing hypertension</h5><br />Firstly, NICE recommend measuring blood pressure in both arms when considering a diagnosis of hypertension. <br /><br />If the difference in readings between arms is more than 20 mmHg then the measurements should be repeated. If the difference remains > 20 mmHg then subsequent blood pressures should be recorded from the arm with the higher reading.<br /><br />It should of course be remember that there are pathological causes of unequal blood pressure readings from the arms, such as supravalvular aortic stenosis. It is therefore prudent to listen to the heart sounds if a difference exists and further investigation if a very large difference is noted.<br /><br />NICE also recommend taking a second reading during the consultation, if the first reading is > 140/90 mmHg. The lower reading of the two should determine further management.<br /><br />NICE suggest offering ABPM or HBPM to any patient with a blood pressure >= 140/90 mmHg.<br /><br />If the blood pressure is >= 180/120 mmHg:<br /><ul><li>admit for specialist assessment if:<ul><li><span class=\"concept\" data-cid=\"10965\">signs of retinal haemorrhage or papilloedema (accelerated hypertension)</span> or</li><li>life-threatening symptoms such as <span class=\"concept\" data-cid=\"10966\">new-onset confusion, chest pain, signs of heart failure, or acute kidney injury</span></li></ul></li><li>NICE also recommend referral if a phaeochromocytoma is suspected (labile or postural hypotension, headache, palpitations, pallor and diaphoresis)</li><li>if none of the above then arrange <span class=\"concept\" data-cid=\"10967\">urgent investigations for end-organ damage</span> (e.g. bloods, urine ACR, ECG)<ul><li>if target organ damage is identified, consider starting antihypertensive drug treatment immediately, without waiting for the results of ABPM or HBPM.</li><li>if no target organ damage is identified, repeat clinic blood pressure measurement within 7 days</li></ul></li></ul><br />Ambulatory blood pressure monitoring (ABPM)<br /><ul><li>at least 2 measurements per hour during the person's usual waking hours (for example, between 08:00 and 22:00)</li><li>use the average value of at least 14 measurements</li></ul><br />If ABPM is not tolerated or declined HBPM should be offered.<br /><br />Home blood pressure monitoring (HBPM)<br /><ul><li>for each BP recording, two consecutive measurements need to be taken, at least 1 minute apart and with the person seated</li><li>BP should be recorded twice daily, ideally in the morning and evening</li><li>BP should be recorded for at least 4 days, ideally for 7 days</li><li>discard the measurements taken on the first day and use the average value of all the remaining measurements</li></ul><br /><h5 class='notes-heading'>Interpreting the results</h5><br />ABPM/HBPM >= 135/85 mmHg (i.e. stage 1 hypertension)<br /><ul><li>treat if < 80 years of age AND any of the following apply; target organ damage, established cardiovascular disease, renal disease, diabetes or a 10-year cardiovascular risk equivalent to 10% or greater</li><li>in 2019, NICE made a further recommendation, suggesting that we should <i>'consider antihypertensive drug treatment in addition to lifestyle advice for adults aged under 60 with stage 1 hypertension and an estimated 10-year risk below 10%.

            "<b>Review in the community at 3 months of age</b> is the correct management. Undescended testis (cryptorchidism) is a common finding, affecting around 2-3% of term male infants. Many of these testes will descend spontaneously into the scrotum during the first three months of life. Therefore, the standard UK practice for a unilateral undescended testis in an otherwise healthy term infant is a 'watchful waiting' approach. The parents should be advised that a further examination is required at 3 months of age, typically by the GP. If the testis has not descended by this point, a non-urgent referral to a paediatric urologist or surgeon is indicated. The goal is for surgical correction (orchidopexy) to be performed before the child is 18 months old, ideally around their first birthday, to optimise fertility and reduce the long-term risk of testicular malignancy.<br /><br /><b>Refer to paediatric urology now</b> is incorrect. Immediate referral is not necessary as a significant proportion of undescended testes will descend spontaneously within the first three months. Referring all newborns with this finding would lead to unnecessary specialist appointments and parental anxiety. The referral pathway is initiated only after the 3-month review confirms the testis remains undescended.<br /><br /><b>Arrange an urgent paediatric review within 24 hours</b> is incorrect. This urgent review is mandated for infants with bilateral impalpable testes. The concern in bilateral cases is the possibility of an underlying disorder of sexual development (DSD), such as congenital adrenal hyperplasia (CAH), which can present as a salt-wasting crisis and is a neonatal emergency. As this infant has one palpable testis and is otherwise well, an urgent review is not required.<br /><br /><b>Arrange an ultrasound scan of the scrotum</b> is not the most appropriate next step.

        "title": "Diabetes mellitus: GLP-1 drugs",
        "body": "A number of drugs to treat diabetes mellitus have become available in recent years. Much research has focused around the role of glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1), a hormone released by the small intestine in response to an oral glucose load<br /><br />Whilst it is well known that insulin resistance and insufficient B-cell compensation occur other effects are also seen in type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM). In normal physiology an oral glucose load results in a greater release of insulin than if the same load is given intravenously - this known as the incretin effect. This effect is largely mediated by GLP-1 and is known to be decreased in T2DM.<br /><br />Increasing GLP-1 levels, either by the administration of an analogue (glucagon-like peptide-1, GLP-1 mimetics, e.g. exenatide) or inhibiting its breakdown (dipeptidyl peptidase-4 ,DPP-4 inhibitors - the gliptins), is therefore the target of two recent classes of drug.<br /><br /><br /><h5 class='notes-heading'>Glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) mimetics (e.g. exenatide)</h5><br />Exenatide is an example of a <span class=\"concept\" data-cid=\"389\">glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) mimetic</span>. These drugs increase insulin secretion and inhibit glucagon secretion. One of the major advances of GLP-1 mimetics is that they typically result in weight loss, in contrast to many medications such as insulin, sulfonylureas and thiazolidinediones. They are sometimes <span class=\"concept\" data-cid=\"9345\">used in combination with insulin in T2DM to minimise weight gain</span>.<br /><br />Exenatide must be given by subcutaneous injection within 60 minutes before the morning and evening meals. It should not be given after a meal.<br /><br />Liraglutide is the other GLP-1 mimetic currently available. One the main advantages of liraglutide over exenatide is that it only needs to be given once a day.<br /><br />Both exenatide and liraglutide may be combined with metformin and a sulfonylurea. Standard release exenatide is also licensed to be used with basal insulin alone or with metformin. Please see the BNF for a more complete list of licensed indications.<br /><br />NICE state the following:<br /><br /><div class='bs-callout bs-callout-default'><i><i><br />Consider adding exenatide to metformin and a sulfonylurea if:<br /><ul><li>BMI >= 35 kg/m\u00b2 in people of European descent and there are problems associated with high weight, or</li><li>BMI < 35 kg/m\u00b2 and insulin is unacceptable because of occupational implications or weight loss would benefit other comorbidities.</li></ul></i></i></div><br />NICE like patients to have achieved a > 11 mmol/mol (1%) reduction in HbA1c and 3% weight loss after 6 months to justify the ongoing prescription of GLP-1 mimetics.<br /><br />The major adverse effect of GLP-1 mimetics is <span class=\"concept\" data-cid=\"388\">nausea and vomiting</span>. The Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency has issued specific warnings on the use of exenatide, reporting that is has been linked to <span class=\"concept\" data-cid=\"9346\">severe pancreatitis</span> in some patients.<br /><br /><br /><h5 class='notes-heading'>Dipeptidyl peptidase-4 (DPP-4) inhibitors (e.g. Vildagliptin, sitagliptin)</h5><br />Key points<br /><ul><li>dipeptidyl peptidase-4, DPP-4 inhibitors <span class=\"concept\" data-cid=\"11012\">increase levels of incretins (GLP-1 and GIP)</span> by <span class=\"concept\" data-cid=\"390\">decreasing their peripheral breakdown</span></li><li>oral preparation</li><li>trials to date show that the drugs are relatively well tolerated with no increased incidence of hypoglycaemia</li><li><span class=\"concept\" data-cid=\"3352\">do not cause weight gain</span></li></ul><br />NICE guidelines on DPP-4 inhibitors<br /><ul><li>NICE suggest that a DPP-4 inhibitor might be preferable to a thiazolidinedione if further weight gain would cause significant problems, a thiazolidinedione is contraindicated or the person has had a poor response to a thiazolidinedione</li></ul>",
