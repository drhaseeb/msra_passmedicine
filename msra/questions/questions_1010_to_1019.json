        "body": "NICE updated its depression guidelines in 2022. It now favours a simple classification of depression severity<br /><ul><li>'less severe' depression: encompasses what was previously termed subthreshold and mild depression<ul><li>a PHQ-9 score of < 16</li></ul></li><li>'more severe' depression: encompasses what was previously termed moderate and severe depression<ul><li>a PHQ-9 score of  \u2265 16</li></ul></li></ul><br />The NICE guidelines are long and contain many important principles about dealing with patients who have depression. The following is a very brief section highlighting key points.<br /><br /><h5 class='notes-heading'>Management of less severe depression</h5><br />NICE lists a large number of interventions that may be used first-line. It encourages us to discuss treatment options with patients to reach a shared decision. They recommend considering <i>'the least intrusive and least resource intensive treatment first'</i>. It also recommends not routinely offering <i>'<span class=\"concept\" data-cid=\"11932\">antidepressant medication as first-line treatment for less severe depression, unless that is the person's preference</span>'.</i><br /><br />Treatment options, listed in order of preference by NICE<br /><ul><li><span class=\"concept\" data-cid=\"11931\">guided self-help</span></li><li>group cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT)</li><li>group behavioural activation (BA)</li><li>individual CBT</li><li>individual BA</li><li>group exercise</li><li>group mindfulness and meditation</li><li>interpersonal psychotherapy (IPT)</li><li><span class=\"concept\" data-cid=\"10936\">selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs)</span></li><li>counselling</li><li>short-term psychodynamic psychotherapy (STPP)</li></ul><br /><h5 class='notes-heading'>Management of more severe depression</h5><br />Again, NICE recommend a shared decision should be made. <br /><br />Treatment options, listed in order of preference by NICE<br /><ul><li><span class=\"concept\" data-cid=\"11930\">a combination of individual cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT) and an antidepressant</span></li><li>individual CBT</li><li>individual behavioural activation (BA)</li><li>antidepressant medication<ul><li>selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI), or</li><li>serotonin-norepinephrine reuptake inhibitor (SNRI), or</li><li>another antidepressant if indicated based on previous clinical and treatment history</li></ul></li><li>individual problem-solving</li><li>counselling</li><li>short-term psychodynamic psychotherapy (STPP)</li><li>interpersonal psychotherapy (IPT)</li><li>guided self-help</li><li>group exercise</li></ul>",

            "This patient has had a cholecystectomy and is presenting with symptoms of biliary obstruction (jaundice and right upper quadrant pain). This is most likely due to gallstones being left in the common bile duct (CBD) which can lead to obstructive jaundice symptoms post-cholecystectomy. <br /><br />A failure of surgical anastomosis would cause an anastomotic leak in a shorter time frame than the 3-week interval in which this patient is presenting. Typically bile leaks will be identified within the first week post-operatively and will lead to abdominal pain, diaphragmatic irritation (causing shortness of breath and pain on deep inspiration), and peritonitic features on examination. This patient appears relatively comfortable in comparison to patient's who present with an anastomotic leak.<br /><br />Jaundice and pain secondary to a malignant process are unlikely to have occurred in such a short time frame following a period that would have included imaging to exclude any malignancy. Prior to the cholecystectomy, the patient would have had CT scans which would have been likely to flag up a local malignancy which would then cause biliary obstruction. It is important to note that there may (or may not be) evidence of systemic symptoms in patients with malignancy - these include unplanned weight loss, night sweats, and bone pain. <br /><br />Post-operative hepatic impairment would not typically be associated with jaundice and is not the most <u>likely</u> cause for a presentation post-operatively for a patient who has previously known gallstones. The patient would need work up with LFTs sending and consideration of imaging to assess for hepatitis if this was the most likely clinical diagnosis.<br /><br />While incomplete gallbladder resection occurs in up to 13% of laparoscopic cholecystectomies (a slightly greater number than open cholecystectomies), it is less common than CBD gallstones and, is such, the incorrect answer. It is also important to note the timeframe in the vignette, this patient is presenting 3 weeks after the operation - most gallbladder stump gallstone presentations occur over 9 months following incomplete gallbladder removal (this timeframe is noted to range up to 25 years post-operatively in one study).",

            "<b>Clopidogrel</b> is the correct answer. According to UK NICE guidelines for the management of NSTEMI, patients should be treated with dual antiplatelet therapy (DAPT), which consists of aspirin plus a second antiplatelet agent. For patients who are managed conservatively (i.e., not with immediate coronary angiography and PCI), the choice of the second agent depends on their bleeding risk. Ticagrelor is generally the preferred agent due to its superior efficacy. However, for patients with a high risk of bleeding, clopidogrel is recommended as it has a lower associated bleeding risk. This 82-year-old man has a history of a duodenal ulcer bleed just 4 months ago, which places him at a high risk of gastrointestinal bleeding. Therefore, the safer and most appropriate choice for the second antiplatelet agent in this scenario is clopidogrel.<br /><br /><b>Ticagrelor</b> is a potent P2Y12 inhibitor and is the recommended second antiplatelet agent for most patients with NSTEMI managed conservatively, in addition to aspirin. It has been shown to be more effective than clopidogrel in reducing cardiovascular events. However, this increased efficacy comes at the cost of a higher risk of non-CABG related major bleeding. NICE guidance specifically recommends using clopidogrel instead of ticagrelor in patients who are deemed to have a high bleeding risk. The patient's recent history of a significant gastrointestinal bleed is a major risk factor for future bleeding, making the more potent antiplatelet ticagrelor a less suitable option in this case.<br /><br /><b>Prasugrel</b> is another potent P2Y12 inhibitor. Its use is primarily indicated for patients with ACS who are proceeding to percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI). It is not recommended for patients who are being managed medically without planned PCI. Furthermore, prasugrel is contraindicated in patients with a history of stroke or transient ischaemic attack and should be used with caution in patients over 75 years of age due to an increased risk of intracranial haemorrhage. Given the patient's age and the plan for conservative management, prasugrel is not an appropriate choice.<br /><br /><b>Fondaparinux</b> is an antithrombin agent (a synthetic factor Xa inhibitor), not an antiplatelet drug. It is recommended by NICE as the anticoagulant of choice for patients with NSTEMI who are not at high risk of bleeding and are not scheduled for immediate angiography. While this patient would likely receive an antithrombin like fondaparinux as part of his treatment, it is given in addition to dual antiplatelet therapy and does not replace the second antiplatelet agent. The question specifically asks for an additional antiplatelet agent to be given with aspirin.<br /><br /><b>Abciximab</b> is a glycoprotein IIb/IIIa inhibitor. These are potent intravenous antiplatelet agents that are reserved for use in very specific, high-risk situations, typically during PCI (for example, as 'bailout' therapy for a large thrombus burden or no-reflow phenomenon). It has no role in the routine initial conservative management of a patient with NSTEMI. Its use is associated with a significant risk of bleeding and is therefore inappropriate in this context, especially given the patient's bleeding history.",

        "body": "Acute coronary syndrome (ACS) is a very common and important presentation in medicine. The management of ACS has evolved over recent years, with the development of new drugs and procedures such as percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI).<br /><br />Emergency departments often have their own protocols based on local factors such as the availability of PCI and hospital drug formularies. The following is based on the 2020 update to the NICE ACS guidelines.<br /><br />Acute coronary syndrome can be classified as follows:<br /><ul><li>ST-elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI): ST-segment elevation + elevated biomarkers of myocardial damage</li><li>non ST-elevation myocardial infarction (NSTEMI): ECG changes but no ST-segment elevation + elevated biomarkers of myocardial damage</li><li>unstable angina</li></ul><br />The management of ACS depends on the particular subtype.

            "<b>Avoid alcohol throughout pregnancy</b> is the correct answer and aligns with current NICE guidelines. In 2016, the Chief Medical Officer updated the guidance on alcohol consumption during pregnancy, stating: 'If you are pregnant or planning a pregnancy, the safest approach is not to drink alcohol at all, to keep risks to your baby to a minimum.' This represents a shift from previous advice which suggested limited consumption might be acceptable. The current guidance is based on the precautionary principle, as there is no established safe level of alcohol consumption during pregnancy. Alcohol readily crosses the placenta and can affect fetal development at all stages of pregnancy. Fetal Alcohol Spectrum Disorders (FASD) encompass a range of physical, cognitive, and behavioural disabilities that can result from prenatal alcohol exposure, with the severity generally correlating with the amount consumed.<br /><br /><b>Avoid first trimester. If then chooses to drink 1 to 2 units once or twice per week</b> is incorrect according to current guidelines. While the first trimester is a particularly vulnerable period for organogenesis, alcohol can affect fetal development throughout pregnancy. The brain continues to develop throughout pregnancy and even into early childhood, making it susceptible to alcohol-related damage at any stage. This advice represents outdated guidance that has been superseded by the more cautious approach now recommended.<br /><br /><b>Avoid first and second trimester. If then chooses to drink 1 to 4 units no more than twice per week</b> is incorrect. This suggestion implies that third-trimester alcohol consumption is less risky, which is not supported by evidence. Significant brain development occurs in the third trimester, and alcohol consumption during this period can still cause neurological damage. The current guidelines make no distinction between trimesters in terms of safety of alcohol consumption.<br /><br /><b>1 to 2 units once per week throughout pregnancy</b> is incorrect. This advice contradicts the current recommendation of complete abstinence. Even low levels of alcohol consumption have not been proven safe during pregnancy. Observational studies have methodological limitations in establishing a definitive 'safe' threshold, and individual variations in metabolism mean that the same amount of alcohol may affect different pregnancies differently. Therefore, the safest approach is to avoid alcohol completely.<br /><br /><b>Limit to 4 units per week with no more than 2 units on any single occasion</b> is incorrect and potentially harmful advice. This suggestion implies that moderate drinking is acceptable during pregnancy, which contradicts current guidelines. The pattern of drinking (binge versus regular consumption) may influence risk, but both should be avoided. Four units per week exceeds any previously suggested 'lower risk' threshold from older guidelines and could potentially lead to measurable effects on fetal development, particularly if consumed in a single session. The current guidance emphasises that there is no known safe amount of alcohol during pregnancy.",

            "The correct answer is Fragile X syndrome. Fragile X syndrome is an X-linked dominant condition characterised by intellectual disability, behavioural problems, and distinctive physical features. Importantly, children with Fragile X syndrome typically have macrocephaly (large head circumference), not microcephaly as described in this case. The condition is caused by a mutation in the FMR1 gene and is the most common inherited cause of intellectual disability.<br /><br /><b>Congenital infection</b> is a plausible cause of microcephaly. Infections such as <i>Toxoplasma gondii</i>, rubella virus, cytomegalovirus, herpes simplex virus, and more recently, Zika virus can cause intrauterine infections leading to impaired brain development and resultant microcephaly.<br /><br /><b>Normal variant</b> is a possible explanation for the finding. Some children naturally have smaller head circumferences that track along lower centiles without any underlying pathology. This is particularly true if the parents have smaller head circumferences and if the child is otherwise developing normally.<br /><br /><b>Craniosynostosis</b> can cause microcephaly due to premature fusion of cranial sutures, restricting normal brain growth and skull expansion. This condition requires careful monitoring and may need surgical intervention if there are signs of increased intracranial pressure or significant cosmetic concerns.<br /><br /><b>Hypoxic ischaemic encephalopathy</b> occurring during the perinatal period can result in brain injury and subsequent microcephaly.
