Hypokalaemia makes the heart more sensitive to the effects of digoxin, exacerbating its toxic effects. Digoxin toxicity can cause ECG changes such as ST-segment depression and T-wave flattening, along with symptoms such as nausea, dizziness, lethargy, and vision changes, as described in the scenario. Blood tests confirm that digoxin concentration is raised, although digoxin toxicity can even occur when the concentration is within the therapeutic range. <br /><br /><b> Bisoprolol </b> is a beta-blocker and does not directly impact potassium levels or digoxin clearance. However, both digoxin and bisoprolol can increase the risk of bradycardia. <br /><br /><b> Eplerenone </b> is a potassium-sparing diuretic, which tends to increase potassium levels rather than lower them, which is protective against digoxin toxicity. The BNF states that it very slightly increases the exposure to digoxin.

        "question": "Tom is an 8-year-old boy with known sickle cell disease who presents with very mild pain in his lower back for 2 days. His observations include a blood pressure of 95/60 mmHg, heart rate of 108 bpm, respiratory rate of 32/min and a temperature of 38.1 degrees centigrade. The examination is normal and there is no obvious source of infection. He is in mild pain and is already taking regular paracetamol and ibuprofen. What would be the correct management?<br />",

            "The correct answer is <b>Refer for MRI</b>. In a patient with suspected spinal stenosis, an MRI scan is the most appropriate next step. This is because it can provide detailed images of the spinal cord and surrounding structures, allowing for a clear visualisation of any narrowing (stenosis) that may be present. According to the UK's National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE), MRI is recommended as the first-line imaging modality in patients with suspected lumbar spinal stenosis.<br /><br />Discussing each of the incorrect answers:<br /><br /><b>Lumbar spine x-ray</b>: While this can show changes related to aging or injury, it does not provide a detailed image of soft tissues such as intervertebral discs or nerves. Therefore, it would not be sufficient in identifying spinal stenosis.<br /><br /><b>Arrange physiotherapy</b>: Physiotherapy can indeed be beneficial in managing symptoms associated with spinal stenosis such as pain and mobility issues. However, before starting treatment, confirmation of the diagnosis via appropriate imaging (MRI) is important.<br /><br /><b>Refer for duplex scan</b>: Duplex scanning combines traditional ultrasound with Doppler ultrasound to visualize blood flow in vessels. It would be useful if there was suspicion of vascular disease causing claudication symptoms mimicking spinal stenosis but given that vascular examination was normal, this option would not be relevant in this case.<br /><br /><b>Perform a myeloma screen</b>: Myeloma screening involves blood tests to detect abnormal proteins produced by malignant plasma cells. While back pain could indeed be a symptom of multiple myeloma, there are no other accompanying signs or symptoms suggestive of this condition presented in this scenario such as anaemia or renal impairment. Hence, performing a myeloma screen wouldn't be necessary at this point without additional supporting evidence.",

After prescribing analgesia, what is the most appropriate next step?",
        "correct_answer": "4",
        "question_notes": "The correct answer is <b>Refer for MRI</b>. In a patient with suspected spinal stenosis, an MRI scan is the most appropriate next step. This is because it can provide detailed images of the spinal cord and surrounding structures, allowing for a clear visualisation of any narrowing (stenosis) that may be present. According to the UK's National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE), MRI is recommended as the first-line imaging modality in patients with suspected lumbar spinal stenosis.<br /><br />Discussing each of the incorrect answers:<br /><br /><b>Lumbar spine x-ray</b>: While this can show changes related to aging or injury, it does not provide a detailed image of soft tissues such as intervertebral discs or nerves. Therefore, it would not be sufficient in identifying spinal stenosis.<br /><br /><b>Arrange physiotherapy</b>: Physiotherapy can indeed be beneficial in managing symptoms associated with spinal stenosis such as pain and mobility issues. However, before starting treatment, confirmation of the diagnosis via appropriate imaging (MRI) is important.<br /><br /><b>Refer for duplex scan</b>: Duplex scanning combines traditional ultrasound with Doppler ultrasound to visualize blood flow in vessels. It would be useful if there was suspicion of vascular disease causing claudication symptoms mimicking spinal stenosis but given that vascular examination was normal, this option would not be relevant in this case.<br /><br /><b>Perform a myeloma screen</b>: Myeloma screening involves blood tests to detect abnormal proteins produced by malignant plasma cells. While back pain could indeed be a symptom of multiple myeloma, there are no other accompanying signs or symptoms suggestive of this condition presented in this scenario such as anaemia or renal impairment. Hence, performing a myeloma screen wouldn't be necessary at this point without additional supporting evidence.",
