        "body": "Acute coronary syndrome (ACS) is a very common and important presentation in medicine. The management of ACS has evolved over recent years, with the development of new drugs and procedures such as percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI).<br /><br />Emergency departments often have their own protocols based on local factors such as the availability of PCI and hospital drug formularies. The following is based on the 2020 update to the NICE ACS guidelines.<br /><br />Acute coronary syndrome can be classified as follows:<br /><ul><li>ST-elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI): ST-segment elevation + elevated biomarkers of myocardial damage</li><li>non ST-elevation myocardial infarction (NSTEMI): ECG changes but no ST-segment elevation + elevated biomarkers of myocardial damage</li><li>unstable angina</li></ul><br />The management of ACS depends on the particular subtype. NICE management guidance groups the patients into two groups:<br /><ul><li>1. STEMI</li><li>2.

        "body": "<h5 class='notes-heading'>Embryology</h5><br />During development the umbilicus has two umbilical arteries and one umbilical vein. The arteries are continuous with the internal iliac arteries and the vein is continuous with the falciform ligament (ductus venosus). After birth, the cord dessicates and separates and the umbilical ring closes. <br /><br /><h5 class='notes-heading'>Umbilical hernia</h5><br />Up to 20% of neonates may have an umbilical hernia, it is more common in premature infants. The majority of these hernias will close spontaneously (may take between 12 months and three years). Strangulation is rare.<br /><br /><h5 class='notes-heading'>Paraumbilical hernia</h5><br />These are due to defects in the linea alba that are in close proximity to the umbilicus. The edges of a paraumbilical hernia are more clearly defined than those of an umbilical hernia. They are less likely to resolve spontaneously than an umbilical hernia.<br /><br /><h5 class='notes-heading'>Omphalitis</h5><br />This condition consists of an infection of the umbilicus. Infection with <i>Staphylococcus aureus</i> is the commonest cause. The condition is potentially serious as infection may spread rapidly through the umbilical vessels in neonates with a risk of portal pyaemia, and portal vein thrombosis. Treatment is usually with a combination of topical and systemic antibiotics.<br /><br /><h5 class='notes-heading'>Umbilical granuloma</h5><br />These consist of cherry red lesions surrounding the umbilicus, they may bleed on contact and be a site of seropurulent discharge. Infection is unusual and they will often respond favourably to chemical cautery with topically applied silver nitrate. <br /><br /><h5 class='notes-heading'>Persistent urachus</h5><br />This is characterised by urinary discharge from the umbilicus. It is caused by persistence of the urachus which attaches to the bladder. They are associated with other urogenital abnormalities. <br /><br /><h5 class='notes-heading'>Persistent vitello-intestinal duct</h5><br />This will typically present as an umbilical discharge that discharges small bowel content. Complete persistence of the duct is a rare condition. Much more common is the persistence of part of the duct (Meckel's diverticulum). Persistent vitello-intestinal ducts are best imaged using a contrast study to delineate the anatomy and are managed by laparotomy and surgical closure.",

            "The correct answer is <b>Immediately</b>. According to the UK Faculty of Sexual and Reproductive Healthcare (FSRH) guidelines, a Nexplanon device can be inserted immediately after a medical termination of pregnancy. This allows for immediate contraceptive protection and eliminates the risk of unintended pregnancy due to delayed or missed follow-up appointments. <br /><br /><b>After 7 days</b> is incorrect because there is no need to wait this long after a medical termination of pregnancy before inserting a Nexplanon device. Waiting unnecessarily could increase the risk of an unintended pregnancy.<br /><br /><b>After 4 weeks</b>, <b>After 6 weeks</b>, and <b>After 12 weeks</b> are also incorrect options, as they suggest an unnecessary delay in initiating contraception post-abortion. The FSRH states that all methods of contraception can be started immediately following an uncomplicated abortion at any gestation. Delaying contraceptive initiation may increase the risk of unintended pregnancies, particularly in women who may not return for follow-up visits.

        "question": "A 19-year-old female is reviewed following a medical termination of pregnancy (estimated gestation 8 weeks). She is interested in having a Nexplanon inserted. At what point can Nexplanon be inserted in these circumstances?",
        "correct_answer": "1",
        "question_notes": "The correct answer is <b>Immediately</b>. According to the UK Faculty of Sexual and Reproductive Healthcare (FSRH) guidelines, a Nexplanon device can be inserted immediately after a medical termination of pregnancy. This allows for immediate contraceptive protection and eliminates the risk of unintended pregnancy due to delayed or missed follow-up appointments. <br /><br /><b>After 7 days</b> is incorrect because there is no need to wait this long after a medical termination of pregnancy before inserting a Nexplanon device. Waiting unnecessarily could increase the risk of an unintended pregnancy.<br /><br /><b>After 4 weeks</b>, <b>After 6 weeks</b>, and <b>After 12 weeks</b> are also incorrect options, as they suggest an unnecessary delay in initiating contraception post-abortion.
