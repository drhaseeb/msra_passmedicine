            "<b>Glucagon</b> is the correct answer for this patient with beta-blocker overdose who has failed to respond to atropine. Beta-blockers cause bradycardia and hypotension by blocking beta-adrenergic receptors. Glucagon works through a different mechanism, activating adenylate cyclase independently of beta-receptors, thereby increasing intracellular cyclic AMP. This leads to increased cardiac contractility and heart rate, effectively bypassing the beta-receptor blockade. In beta-blocker overdose, glucagon is specifically indicated when patients remain symptomatic despite adequate doses of atropine (up to 3 mg). It is typically given as an initial bolus followed by an infusion. This patient's persistent severe bradycardia and hypotension after maximal atropine therapy makes glucagon the most appropriate next step. Common side effects include nausea and vomiting, and hyperglycaemia may occur with prolonged use.<br /><br /><b>Adrenaline infusion</b> would seem logical given the cardiovascular collapse, but in beta-blocker overdose, the beta-receptors are blocked, making adrenaline less effective at standard doses. Whilst very high doses of adrenaline might overcome competitive beta-blockade, this approach carries significant risks of arrhythmias and is not first-line therapy. Glucagon, which works independently of beta-receptors, is preferred before resorting to high-dose catecholamines.<br /><br /><b>Calcium gluconate</b> is the antidote for calcium channel blocker overdose, not beta-blocker overdose. Calcium channel blockers cause bradycardia and hypotension through different mechanisms (blocking L-type calcium channels), and calcium salts help overcome this blockade. In beta-blocker toxicity, calcium has no specific role and would not address the underlying pathophysiology of beta-receptor blockade.<br /><br /><b>Sodium bicarbonate</b> is used in tricyclic antidepressant overdose and certain other toxidromes where sodium channel blockade causes QRS widening and arrhythmias. It has no role in beta-blocker overdose, which does not typically cause significant QRS prolongation or respond to alkalinisation. This patient's presentation is consistent with beta-blockade rather than sodium channel blockade.<br /><br /><b>Temporary cardiac pacing</b> may be considered in refractory cases of beta-blocker overdose, but it is not the next appropriate step when medical management with glucagon has not yet been attempted. Pacing addresses the bradycardia but does not improve the myocardial contractility or peripheral vasodilatation that contribute to hypotension in beta-blocker toxicity. Glucagon addresses both chronotropic and inotropic effects and should be tried before invasive interventions.",

The short Synacthen test is the gold standard for diagnosing Addison's disease.

The short Synacthen test is the gold standard for diagnosing Addison's disease. It involves administering synthetic adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH) and measuring cortisol levels before and 30 minutes after ACTH administration. Typically, cortisol levels should rise following ACTH administration; however, in Addison's disease, this response is insufficient compared to normal adrenal function.<br /><br /><b> 24-hour urinary free cortisol</b> measurement is used in the diagnosis of Cushing's syndrome.<br /><br />The <b>dexamethasone suppression test</b> is part of the diagnostic workup for Cushing's syndrome.<br /><br />An <b>insulin tolerance test</b> evaluates the functionality of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis and can be employed to assess levels of cortisol and growth hormone. Therefore, this test may aid in diagnosing conditions such as secondary adrenal insufficiency and growth hormone deficiency.<br /><br />Although <b>plasma cortisol</b> measurements can help diagnose both Addison's disease and Cushing's syndrome, they are more useful as an initial screening tool rather than a definitive diagnostic test for these conditions.",

            "The correct answer is 'osteoporosis'.<br /><br />Anastrozole is an aromatase inhibitor used for the treatment of oestrogen receptor-positive breast cancer in postmenopausal women, such as this patient. Aromatase inhibitors reduce peripheral oestrogen synthesis, which accounts for the majority of oestrogen production in postmenopausal women.
