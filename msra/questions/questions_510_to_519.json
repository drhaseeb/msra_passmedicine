            "The correct answer is <b>Clopidogrel + statin</b>. According to NICE guidelines (NG128), following an ischaemic stroke, patients should be offered clopidogrel 75mg daily as the preferred antiplatelet therapy.

            "The correct answer is <b>Stop ramipril and start losartan</b>. Ramipril is an angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor, which can cause a dry cough in some patients due to the accumulation of bradykinin. This side effect usually occurs within the first few weeks of treatment. Losartan, an angiotensin II receptor blocker (ARB), is a suitable alternative for patients who experience this side effect from ACE inhibitors, as it does not affect bradykinin levels and has a similar antihypertensive efficacy.<br /><br /><b>Stop ramipril and start amlodipine</b> would not be the most appropriate choice in this case. Although amlodipine, a calcium channel blocker, is effective in treating hypertension, it may not provide the same level of renoprotection as an ARB like losartan. Additionally, switching to another class of antihypertensive medication could potentially lead to different side effects or less optimal blood pressure control.<br /><br /><b>Stop ramipril and start indapamide</b> is also not the best option. Indapamide is a thiazide-like diuretic that can be used to treat hypertension; however, it does not offer the same renoprotective benefits as ARBs or ACE inhibitors. Furthermore, diuretics may have other side effects such as electrolyte disturbances that make them less desirable as first-line agents in certain patients.<br /><br /><b>Stop ramipril and start lisinopril</b> would not address the problem since lisinopril is also an ACE inhibitor and thus carries the same risk of causing a dry cough due to bradykinin accumulation.<br /><br />Lastly, <b>Reassure him that the cough is unlikely to be related to ramipril given the time of onset</b> would be incorrect because although the cough started four weeks after initiating ramipril, it is still within the typical timeframe for this side effect to occur.

            "The correct answer is <b>Argyll-Robertson pupil</b>. This is a condition typically associated with neurosyphilis, a tertiary form of syphilis caused by the spirochete <i>Treponema pallidum</i>. In this condition, the pupils are small and irregular in shape. They accommodate (constrict when focusing on near objects) but do not react to direct light, a phenomenon known as 'light-near dissociation'. This occurs due to damage to the pretectal nuclei in the midbrain that control pupillary light reflex.<br /><br /><b>Internuclear ophthalmoplegia</b> is incorrect. It is a disorder characterised by paresis or paralysis of the eye adduction during horizontal gaze due to a lesion of the medial longitudinal fasciculus. The affected individual will have difficulty moving their eye inwards towards the nose but normal or nearly normal abduction on lateral gaze. There would be no changes in pupillary size or reaction.<br /><br /><b>Bilateral third nerve palsy</b> is also incorrect. A lesion affecting cranial nerve III (oculomotor nerve) can cause drooping of the eyelid (ptosis), dilated pupil that does not respond well to light or accommodation, and deviation of the eyeball downwards and outwards. However, it does not cause small pupils that accommodate but do not respond to light.<br /><br />The diagnosis is not <b>Horner's syndrome</b>, which presents with ptosis (drooping eyelid), miosis (small pupil), anhidrosis (lack of sweating) on one side of the face - these are collectively known as Horner's triad. It results from disruption of sympathetic innervation to the face and eye, but it doesn't affect pupillary response to light.<br /><br />Finally, <b>Holmes-Adie syndrome</b> is also incorrect. This condition presents with one or both pupils being large and having slow or absent reactions to light but a normal or near-normal reaction to accommodation - this is known as 'light-near dissociation'. However, unlike Argyll-Robertson pupils which are typically small, Holmes-Adie pupils are usually larger than normal.<br />",

            "The correct answer in this case is a <b>low potassium diet</b>. Patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD) often have difficulty excreting potassium due to reduced kidney function. A build-up of potassium in the blood can lead to hyperkalemia, which can cause serious complications such as abnormal heart rhythms and even cardiac arrest. Therefore, it is important for patients with CKD to follow a low potassium diet to help maintain normal potassium levels.<br /><br />A <b>high calcium diet</b> is not typically recommended for patients with CKD. In fact, these patients may need to limit their calcium intake due to an increased risk of developing hypercalcemia and vascular calcification. In advanced stages of CKD, the kidneys struggle to convert vitamin D into its active form, leading to decreased calcium absorption and secondary hyperparathyroidism. This can result in high serum phosphate levels which contribute to vascular calcification. Therefore, a balance of calcium intake needs to be maintained in CKD patients.<br /><br />A <b>high protein diet</b> is also not advised for patients with CKD. High protein intake can put additional strain on already compromised kidneys by increasing the production of nitrogenous waste products such as urea and creatinine. Instead, a moderate protein intake tailored to the individual's needs is usually recommended for those with CKD.<br /><br />A <b>low starch diet</b> might be beneficial for some individuals, especially those with diabetes or obesity; however, it is not specific advice given solely based on having chronic kidney disease. Patients with CKD should focus on maintaining a balanced diet that meets their nutritional needs while avoiding excessive intake of certain nutrients like potassium and phosphorus.<br /><br />Lastly, a <b>high phosphorus diet</b> is not recommended for patients with CKD either. Similar to the issue with excess calcium intake, high phosphorus levels can contribute to vascular calcification and bone disease. Patients with CKD are often advised to limit their phosphorus intake by avoiding high-phosphorus foods such as dairy products, nuts, and certain processed foods. In some cases, they may also require phosphate binders to help reduce the absorption of phosphorus from their diet.",

            "Cyclizine is a good first line anti-emetic for intracranial or intra-vestibular causes of nausea and vomiting. It is also used in palliative care for gastrointestinal obstruction. <br /><br />Domperidone antagonises the inhibitory effect of dopamine, resulting in stimulation of gastric muscle contraction. It is a good anti-emetic to use for gastro-intestinal pain in palliative care.<br /><br />Metoclopramide is used for the symptomatic relief of acute migraine, chemotherapy or radiotherapy-induced nausea and vomiting. It is a prokinetic agent which is unlikely to provide relief from nausea related to increased intracranial pressure. <br /><br />Ondansetron is indicated for the prevention and treatment of nausea and vomiting related to chemotherapy. It is a selective 5-hydroxytryptamine (5-HT3) antagonist.<br /><br />If steroids are used in palliative care, dexamethasone is usually chosen as the first line. Steroids have multiple indications in this setting including treatment of nausea, anorexia, spinal cord compression and liver capsule pain. Dexamethasone may have a role in treating this patient's nausea if the intracranial pressure is raised and could be considered in addition to cyclizine. Cyclizine should be used as a first-line option if the nausea is thought to be due to raised intracranial pressure.",

        "body": "Nausea and vomiting in palliative care is often multi-factorial, however it is still important to identify the most prominent cause in order to guide choice of anti-emetic therapy. Six potential syndromes have been identified in palliative care, with gastric stasis and chemical disturbance being the most common and prominent. <br /><br /><b>Six broad nausea and vomiting syndromes</b>   <br /><ul><li>Reduced gastric motility<ul><li>May be opioid related</li><li>Related to serotonin (5HT4) and dopamine (D2) receptors</li></ul></li><li>Chemically mediated<ul><li>Secondary to hypercalcaemia, opioids, or chemotherapy</li></ul></li><li>Visceral/serosal<ul><li>Due to constipation</li><li>Oral candidiasis</li></ul></li><li>Raised intra-cranial pressure<ul><li>Usually in context of cerebral metastases </li></ul></li><li>Vestibular<ul><li>Related to activation of acetylcholine and histamine (H1) receptors </li><li>Most frequently in palliative care is opioid related</li><li>Can be motion related, or due to base of skull tumours </li></ul></li><li>Cortical<ul><li>May be due to anxiety, pain, fear and/or anticipatory nausea </li><li>Related to GABA and histamine (H1) receptors in the cerebral cortex</li></ul></li></ul><br />In palliative care, pharmacological therapy is the usually the first-line method for treating nausea and vomiting. In general, there are two approaches to choosing drug therapy, either empirical or mechanistic. An empirical approach involves choosing medication based on either physician preference or commonly a dopamine antagonist (e.g. metoclopramide) is used first-line. Alternatively, the mechanistic approach utilises matching choice of anti-emetic drug to the likely cause of the patient's nausea and vomiting. <br /><br /><b>Mechanistic approach</b><br /><ul><li>Reduced gastric motility<ul><li>Pro-kinetic agents are useful in these scenarios as the nausea and vomiting is usually resulting from gastric dysmotility and stasis</li><li><concept10852Pro-kinetic agents are often dopamine (D2) receptor antagonists</span></li><li>According to BMJ best practice, first-line medications include metoclopramide and domperidone  </li><li>However, NICE indicate that metoclopramide should not be used when pro-kinesis may negatively affect the gastrointestinal tract, particularly in complete bowel obstruction, gastrointestinal perforation, or immediately following gastric surgery</li></ul></li><li>Chemically mediated<ul><li>If possible, the chemical disturbance should be corrected first </li><li>In the context of other chemically mediated syndromes, for example due to opioid medications, there are a number of suggested medications </li><li>Key treatment options include ondansetron, haloperidol and levomepromazine </li></ul></li><li>Visceral/serosal causes<ul><li>Cyclizine and levomepromazine are first-line </li><li>Anti-cholinergics such as hyoscine can be useful </li></ul></li><li>Raised intra-cranial pressure<ul><li><span class=\"concept\" data-cid=\"10734\">Cyclizine</span>is recommended first-line for nausea and vomiting due to intracranial disease</li><li>Dexamethasone can also be usd</li><li>Radiotherapy can be considered if there is likely raised intra-cranial pressure due to cranial tumours</li></ul></li><li>Vestibular<ul><li>BMJ best practice recommends use of cyclizine as a first-line treatment in disorders due to the vestibular system</li><li>Refractory vestibular causes of nausea and vomiting can be treated alternatively with metoclopramide or prochlorperazine</li><li>Atypical antipsychotics such as olanzapine or risperidone can be used in refractory cases according to UptoDate </li></ul></li><li>Cortical<ul><li>If anticipatory nausea is the clear cause, a short acting benzodiazepine such as lorazepam can be useful </li><li>If benzodiazepines are not ideal, BMJ best practice recommends use of cyclizine </li><li>Ondansetron and metoclopramide can also be trialled</li></ul></li></ul><br /><b>Route of administration</b><br /><ul><li>oral anti-emetics are preferable and therefore should be used if possible</li><li>Situations where use of oral medications may not be possible include if the patient is vomiting, has issues with malabsorption, or there is severe gastric stasis </li><li>If the oral route is not possible the parenteral route of administration is preferred</li><li>The intravenous route can be use if intravenous access is already established</li></ul>",
