            "The correct answer is <b>Irregular vaginal bleeding</b>. The progestogen-only pill, also known as the mini-pill, often leads to changes in bleeding patterns. This can include spotting between periods, irregular periods, or even no periods at all. This is due to the way that progestogens affect the endometrium and inhibit ovulation. According to UK guidelines by the Faculty of Sexual & Reproductive Healthcare (FSRH), more than half of women using progestogen-only pills experience some form of altered bleeding pattern.<br /><br />The other options are less common side effects:<br /><br /><b>Acne</b> can be a side effect of hormonal contraception but it's not typically associated with the progestogen only pill. In fact, some types of hormonal contraceptives including combined oral contraceptives are used as a treatment for acne.<br /><br /><b>Mood swings</b> have been reported by some women taking the progestogen-only pill, but this is not considered a common side effect. Mood changes may occur due to fluctuations in hormone levels caused by contraceptive use; however, large-scale studies have not found a significant association between mood changes and use of progestogen-only pills.<br /><br /><b>Reduced libido</b>, while possible with any hormonal contraceptive method due to alterations in hormone levels, it is not commonly associated with the progestogen-only pill compared to other forms of hormonal contraception like combined oral contraceptives. <br /><br />Lastly, <b>Weight gain</b> has long been thought to be a common side effect of all types of hormonal contraception. However, according to recent research and guidelines from FSRH, there's no evidence that progestogen-only pills cause weight gain. Any perceived weight gain may be due to water retention or increased appetite rather than actual fat accumulation.<br />",

According to UK guidelines by the Faculty of Sexual & Reproductive Healthcare (FSRH), more than half of women using progestogen-only pills experience some form of altered bleeding pattern.<br /><br />The other options are less common side effects:<br /><br /><b>Acne</b> can be a side effect of hormonal contraception but it's not typically associated with the progestogen only pill. In fact, some types of hormonal contraceptives including combined oral contraceptives are used as a treatment for acne.<br /><br /><b>Mood swings</b> have been reported by some women taking the progestogen-only pill, but this is not considered a common side effect. Mood changes may occur due to fluctuations in hormone levels caused by contraceptive use; however, large-scale studies have not found a significant association between mood changes and use of progestogen-only pills.<br /><br /><b>Reduced libido</b>, while possible with any hormonal contraceptive method due to alterations in hormone levels, it is not commonly associated with the progestogen-only pill compared to other forms of hormonal contraception like combined oral contraceptives. <br /><br />Lastly, <b>Weight gain</b> has long been thought to be a common side effect of all types of hormonal contraception. However, according to recent research and guidelines from FSRH, there's no evidence that progestogen-only pills cause weight gain. Any perceived weight gain may be due to water retention or increased appetite rather than actual fat accumulation.<br />",

            "<b>Cholangiocarcinoma</b> is correct. This is a cancer of the bile ducts and can present with Courvoisier\u2019s sign. Courvoisier\u2019s sign refers to a non-tender, palpable gallbladder in the presence of jaundice, which suggests malignancy rather than gallstones. The blood test results, particularly the raised bilirubin, \u03b3GT and ALP with normal ALT and albumin levels, suggest an obstructive pattern of jaundice commonly seen in cholangiocarcinoma. The absence of abdominal pain and fever also points away from inflammatory conditions and is consistent with a malignancy. Obesity is a risk factor for biliary diseases, including cholangiocarcinoma, because it increases the likelihood of gallstone formation and chronic inflammation of the biliary tree. Chronic inflammation can predispose to malignant transformation of biliary epithelium, which may lead to cholangiocarcinoma.<br /><br /><b>Acute cholecystitis</b> is incorrect. Acute cholecystitis typically presents with right upper quadrant abdominal pain, fever, and possibly jaundice. However, the patient has no abdominal pain or fever, which makes this diagnosis unlikely. Acute cholecystitis is usually associated with a mild elevation in bilirubin and liver enzymes (ALP and ALT), but the significant rise in bilirubin and ALP without abdominal pain is inconsistent with acute cholecystitis. Obesity is strongly associated with the development of gallstones, which are the primary cause of acute cholecystitis. Women, especially those who are obese or have had multiple pregnancies, are more prone to gallstone disease due to higher oestrogen levels, which increase cholesterol saturation in bile, predisposing them to cholecystitis.<br /><br /><b>Chronic pancreatitis </b> is incorrect. Chronic pancreatitis usually presents with abdominal pain and a history of alcohol use or recurrent episodes of pancreatitis. Some advanced cases could present without pain. Although pancreatitis can cause bile duct compression and jaundice, the painless jaundice and palpable gallbladder are not characteristic. The patient\u2019s normal ALT levels also do not fit a diagnosis of pancreatitis.<br /><br /><b>Hepatocellular carcinoma</b> (HCC) is incorrect. HCC often presents with weight loss, fatigue, and jaundice. While it is true that HCC typically does not cause a palpable gallbladder due to intrahepatic growth patterns; secondary biliary obstruction from an HCC lesion compressing the bile duct can occasionally lead to this finding. Additionally, patients often have underlying liver disease or cirrhosis, which is not suggested by this patient's clinical history or blood results. The isolated rise in bilirubin, \u03b3GT and ALP points to bile duct obstruction, which is more typical of cholangiocarcinoma than HCC. It would be expected that this patient would have an increased ALT alongside these findings.<br /><br /><b>Primary biliary cholangitis</b> (PBC) is incorrect. PBC is an autoimmune disorder primarily affecting women. It typically presents with fatigue, pruritus, and jaundice but does not usually cause a palpable gallbladder. The isolated rise in bilirubin, \u03b3GT and ALP may occur in PBC, but the absence of other features like anti-mitochondrial antibodies or chronic inflammation makes this diagnosis less likely.",

        "question": "A 34-year-old man presents with visual problems. Since yesterday he has developed a 'blind spot' in the visual field of his right eye. This seemed to develop overnight and has got slightly worse since. He has also noticed a slight pain 'behind' his right eye which is worse on moving the eye. Colours, especially red, seem 'washed-out'. When he covers his right eye the vision in the left seems normal. He has feeling generally lethargic for the past few days but is otherwise fit and well. What is the most likely diagnosis?",

            "The correct answer is <b>Metoclopramide</b>. Metoclopramide is a dopamine antagonist and it works by blocking dopamine receptors in the chemoreceptor trigger zone of the central nervous system. This action prevents nausea and vomiting triggered by most stimuli. However, its antagonistic effect on dopamine can also lead to extrapyramidal side-effects such as acute dystonic reactions, akathisia, and parkinsonism. These side effects are more common in young people and females.<br /><br /><b>Meptazinol</b> is an incorrect choice because it's not an antiemetic but rather an opioid analgesic used for the relief of moderate to severe pain. It works primarily by binding to mu-opioid receptors in the central nervous system, which does not typically cause extrapyramidal side effects.<br /><br /><b>Ondansetron</b>, another incorrect choice, is a selective serotonin 5-HT3 receptor antagonist which blocks these receptors both peripherally on vagal nerve terminals and centrally in the chemoreceptor trigger zone. It's commonly used as an antiemetic to treat nausea and vomiting caused by cancer chemotherapy, radiation therapy, and surgery but rarely causes extrapyramidal side effects.<br /><br /><b>Domperidone</b> is also a wrong answer. Domperidone is a peripheral dopamine D2 and D3 antagonist that increases gastric motility and lower oesophageal sphincter tone. While domperidone has been associated with an increased risk of cardiac arrhythmias at high doses or in patients with predisposing factors, it does not readily cross the blood-brain barrier so it's less likely to cause extrapyramidal side effects compared to metoclopramide.<br /><br />Lastly, <b>Cyclizine</b> isn't the best choice either. Cyclizine is a histamine H1 antagonist used commonly for motion sickness and postoperative nausea and vomiting (PONV). It works by inhibiting histaminergic pathways in the vestibular system within the brain thus preventing motion-induced emesis. Extrapyramidal reactions are not typically seen with cyclizine use.<br />",
