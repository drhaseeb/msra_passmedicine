            "The correct answer is the <b>Ulnar nerve</b>. The ulnar nerve innervates the muscles of the hypothenar eminence, as well as the interossei and adductor pollicis, which are responsible for finger abduction and thumb adduction respectively. Therefore, a lesion in this location would lead to weakness of these actions and wasting of the hypothenar eminence.<br /><br />The first option, <b>C7</b>, is incorrect. The C7 root contributes to many nerves including median and radial nerves but does not directly innervate any of the muscles affected in this case. Additionally, a C7 radiculopathy would typically present with triceps weakness (as it's a primary elbow extensor), diminished triceps reflex and numbness along the middle finger - none of which are reported here.<br /><br />The second option, <b>Median nerve</b>, is also incorrect. Although it innervates most of the muscles in the anterior compartment of the forearm and some muscles in the hand, it does not supply any muscles that perform thumb adduction or finger abduction. A lesion here would more likely cause symptoms such as the inability to pronate the forearm or flex the wrist, loss of sensation over lateral 3\u00bd fingers on the palmar aspect.<br /><br />The third option, <b>Radial nerve</b>, is incorrect as well. This nerve primarily supplies extensors of the wrist and fingers, therefore damage to it would typically result in 'wrist drop' rather than weakness in handgrip strength or wasting of hypothenar eminence.<br /><br />Lastly, <b>Anterior interosseous nerve</b> is an incorrect answer because this branch of the median nerve mainly supplies deep flexor muscles that contribute to 'pinch grip'. Damage to this nerve will affect flexion at distal interphalangeal joints but will not affect thumb adduction or cause wasting at hypothenar eminence.",

The more common pathology affecting the ACJ is osteoarthritis which often causes focal tenderness and swelling at the site of the ACJ but would not cause either acromial tenderness or a painful arc in abduction.<br /><br />Cervical radiculopathy would cause neuropathic pain in the distribution of a cervical root.

            "<b>Propranolol</b> is the correct answer. The clinical presentation is highly suggestive of essential tremor. Key features include the postural nature of the tremor (worse on action, such as holding a cup), its bilateral distribution, improvement with alcohol, and a positive family history, which is common as it is often an autosomal dominant condition. The absence of rest tremor, rigidity, or bradykinesia makes Parkinson's disease unlikely. According to UK guidelines (NICE CKS), a non-selective beta-blocker such as propranolol is the first-line pharmacological treatment for essential tremor if it is causing functional or psychological disability. It is thought to work by blocking peripheral beta-2 adrenergic receptors, which reduces the amplitude of the tremor. It is typically started at a low dose and titrated upwards according to response and tolerability.<br /><br /><b>Levodopa</b> is a precursor to dopamine and is the most effective treatment for Parkinson's disease. It is used to manage the motor symptoms of Parkinson's, particularly bradykinesia and rigidity. While it can help the characteristic 'pill-rolling' rest tremor of Parkinson's disease, it is not indicated for essential tremor. The patient in this scenario has a postural tremor and lacks the other cardinal features of Parkinson's disease, making this diagnosis, and therefore this treatment, inappropriate.<br /><br /><b>Pramipexole</b> is a dopamine agonist, another class of medication used primarily in the management of Parkinson's disease, especially in younger patients, or as an adjunct to levodopa in later stages. It can also be used to treat restless legs syndrome. As with levodopa, its use is predicated on a diagnosis of dopamine deficiency, which is the pathophysiology of Parkinson's disease. Given the clinical features point away from Parkinson's disease, pramipexole would not be an appropriate choice.<br /><br /><b>Primidone</b> is an anticonvulsant medication that is also an effective treatment for essential tremor. It is a valid therapeutic option and is sometimes used as a first-line agent, particularly in the United States. However, in UK practice, it is generally considered a second-line treatment, to be used when beta-blockers like propranolol are either contraindicated (e.g., in severe asthma or heart block), not tolerated due to side effects, or have proven ineffective. Therefore, it is not the most appropriate <i>initial</i> choice for this patient.<br /><br /><b>Procyclidine</b> is an anticholinergic agent. Its primary use in movement disorders is for treating drug-induced parkinsonism (e.g., from antipsychotic medication) and, less commonly, as an adjunct for tremor in younger patients with Parkinson's disease. It is not recommended for the treatment of essential tremor. Furthermore, anticholinergic medications carry a significant side-effect burden, including confusion, dry mouth, and urinary retention, which are particularly problematic in older adults like the patient in this scenario.",

This patient is presenting with symptoms of hypercalcaemia (loss of appetite, nausea, fatigue) and the blood test results confirm an elevated calcium level of 3.12 mmol/l. Bendroflumethiazide is a thiazide diuretic which can cause hypercalcaemia by increasing renal tubular reabsorption of calcium.

            "The correct answer is <b>Carbon monoxide poisoning</b>. This patient presents with confusion, headaches, and characteristically cherry-pink mucosa, which are classic features of carbon monoxide poisoning. Carbon monoxide binds to haemoglobin with an affinity 200-250 times greater than oxygen, forming carboxyhaemoglobin. This results in tissue hypoxia and the characteristic cherry-pink appearance of mucous membranes. The confusion and headache are due to cerebral hypoxia. Students living in accommodation with faulty gas appliances or poor ventilation are particularly at risk.<br /><br /><b>Meningitis</b> typically presents with headache, fever, neck stiffness, and photophobia. While confusion may be present, pink mucosa is not a feature. Additional signs such as Kernig's sign and Brudzinski's sign would likely be present, and the onset is usually more acute.<br /><br /><b>Paracetamol overdose</b> initially presents with minimal symptoms in the first 24 hours. Later stages can include right upper quadrant pain, nausea, vomiting, and eventually hepatic encephalopathy. Pink mucosa is not a feature, and the patient would likely report taking paracetamol.<br /><br /><b>Subarachnoid haemorrhage</b> typically presents with a sudden onset, severe 'thunderclap' headache, often described as the worst headache ever. While confusion may occur, the onset is usually dramatic and accompanied by meningism, photophobia, and possibly focal neurological signs. Pink mucosa is not a feature.<br /><br /><b>Methaemoglobinaemia</b>, while causing altered haemoglobin, typically presents with central cyanosis rather than pink mucosa. It occurs when haemoglobin is oxidised to methaemoglobin, which cannot carry oxygen effectively. It's usually caused by exposure to oxidising medications or chemicals, which isn't suggested in this clinical scenario.",

            "This patient is experiencing intermittent claudication, characterised by the onset of lower leg pain on exertion and relieved by rest. It is important to differentiate intermittent claudication from critical limb ischaemia that is characterised by pain at rest. Intermittent claudication is a symptom of peripheral vascular disease for which the most common cause is atherosclerosis. An ankle-brachial pressure index of < 0.9 is suggestive of PAD, with an index < 0.5 suggesting critical limb ischaemia. There are several of risk factors in this patient's history including smoking, hypertension and obesity. NICE guidelines currently recommend that all patients with peripheral vascular disease initiate treatment with clopidogrel and atorvastatin. <br /><br />Aspirin is a common antiplatelet drug used in the treatment of angina and often makes up dual-antiplatelet therapy in patients who cannot take anticoagulants. However, it is not the first-line antiplatelet in the treatment of PAD. Rather, it should be used if clopidogrel is not tolerated.<br /><br />Low molecular weight heparin would be indicated if the underlying diagnosis was a deep vein thrombosis. Signs of a DVT include unilateral calf pain and swelling associated with tenderness along the course of the deep venous system.  <br /><br />Metformin would be indicated if there this patient had raised blood sugars, suggesting a diagnosis of diabetes mellitus. Patients with vascular risk factors such as smoking, hypertension and obesity should have their glucose regularly checked. Without a HbA1c or blood glucose reading, it would not be appropriate to start metformin.<br /><br />Ramipril would be indicated if this patient needed tighter blood pressure control.
