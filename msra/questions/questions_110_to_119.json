            "<b>Switch to ramipril</b> is the most appropriate management in this case. This patient has developed bilateral ankle oedema as a side effect of amlodipine, a dihydropyridine calcium channel blocker. This occurs due to preferential dilatation of precapillary vessels compared to postcapillary vessels, leading to increased capillary hydrostatic pressure and fluid extravasation into the interstitial space. The oedema is not due to fluid retention or cardiac dysfunction, which is why diuretics are ineffective for this type of swelling. The clinical picture does not suggest heart failure (normal JVP, clear chest, well-controlled blood pressure), making this a medication side effect rather than a pathological process. Since her blood pressure is well controlled, switching to an alternative antihypertensive agent such as an ACE inhibitor is appropriate. This addresses both the side effect and maintains blood pressure control. Amlodipine-induced ankle swelling occurs in approximately 10-30% of patients and is dose-dependent.<br /><br /><b>Add furosemide</b> would be inappropriate as this patient's ankle swelling is not due to fluid overload or cardiac failure. Diuretics are ineffective for treating calcium channel blocker-induced peripheral oedema because the mechanism is related to local vascular effects rather than systemic fluid retention. Adding a diuretic would expose the patient to unnecessary medication and potential side effects such as electrolyte disturbances and dehydration without addressing the underlying cause of the swelling.<br /><br /><b>Arrange echocardiography</b> is not indicated in this scenario. The patient has no clinical features suggestive of heart failure: her JVP is not elevated, her chest is clear on auscultation, and her blood pressure is well controlled. The temporal relationship between starting amlodipine and developing ankle swelling, combined with the absence of other cardiac symptoms, makes a medication side effect the most likely diagnosis. Echocardiography would be appropriate if there were clinical signs of cardiac dysfunction, but this would represent unnecessary investigation in this context.<br /><br /><b>Request venous duplex ultrasound</b> would be considered if there were concern about venous insufficiency or deep vein thrombosis. However, the bilateral nature of the swelling, its gradual onset over several weeks, and the clear temporal relationship with amlodipine initiation make a medication side effect much more likely. Venous duplex would be appropriate for unilateral swelling or if there were features suggesting acute venous thrombosis such as pain, warmth, or erythema.<br /><br /><b>Increase amlodipine to 10mg daily</b> would be inappropriate and likely worsen the ankle swelling. Peripheral oedema from dihydropyridine calcium channel blockers is dose-dependent, so increasing the dose would exacerbate this side effect. Furthermore, the patient's blood pressure is already well controlled at 132/78 mmHg, so there is no clinical indication to increase the antihypertensive dose.

        "body": "Osteoporosis is a disorder affecting the skeletal system characterised by loss of bone mass. Bone mineral density decreases with age but the World Health Organisation define osteoporosis as presence of bone mineral density (BMD) of less than 2.5 standard deviations (SD) below the young adult mean density.<br /><br />Osteoporosis is an important as it increases the risk of fragility (i.e. non-traumatic) fractures. Certain fragility fractures such as fractured neck of femur are associated with significant morbidity and mortality. Around 50% of post-menopausal women will suffer an osteoporotic fracture at some point.<br /><br />The major risk factors for osteoporosis are age and female gender. Other risk factors include:<br /><ul><li>corticosteroid use</li><li>smoking</li><li>alcohol</li><li>low body mass index</li><li>family history</li></ul><br />Guidelines recommend using a screening tool such as FRAX or QFracture to assess the 10-year risk of a patient developing a fragility fracture. A patient who has sustained a fragility fracture (e.g. following a Colles' wrist fracture) should also be assessed for osteoporosis.<br /><br />To assess the actual bone mineral density a dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry (DEXA) scan is used. The DEXA scan looks at the hip and lumbar spine. If either have a T score of < -2.5 then treatment is recommended.<br /><br />The first-line treatment for osteoporosis is an oral bisphosphonate such as alendronate. Other treatments are available but the vast majority of patients are managed with this therapy.",

Additionally, her blood results show anaemia, thrombocytopenia and neutropenia, showing that her bone marrow is being suppressed. This has been caused by the co-prescription of methotrexate, an antimetabolite that inhibits dihydrofolate reductase, and co-trimoxazole, this medication is an antibiotic composed of sulfamethoxazole and trimethoprim. It is classically used to treat <i>Pneumocystis jirovecii</i> pneumonia in HIV-positive patients, but in some trusts can be used to treat hospital-acquired pneumonia. Trimethoprim also inhibits dihydrofolate reductase, and the synergic action of these two drugs can cause severe myelosuppression, as in this case, hence they should never be co-prescribed.  <br /><br /><b>Azithromycin</b> is a macrolide antibiotic which can be useful to manage different infections such as sexually transmitted ones in penicillin-allergic individuals.

Trimethoprim also inhibits dihydrofolate reductase, and the synergic action of these two drugs can cause severe myelosuppression, as in this case, hence they should never be co-prescribed.  <br /><br /><b>Azithromycin</b> is a macrolide antibiotic which can be useful to manage different infections such as sexually transmitted ones in penicillin-allergic individuals. It does not interact with methotrexate, but it should not be prescribed concurrently with statins as it can increase the risk of myopathy and rhabdomyolysis. Hence, this could not be the cause of the myelosuppression in this patient. <br /><br /><b>Clarithromycin</b> is a macrolide antibiotic which can be useful to manage multiple infections such as pneumonia in penicillin-allergic individuals. It does not interact with methotrexate, but it should not be prescribed concurrently with statins as it can increase the risk of myopathy and rhabdomyolysis.<br /><br /><b>Flucloxacillin</b> is a penicillin antibiotic often used to treat infections such as cellulitis. It does not interact with methotrexate, but it can cause cholestasis. Hence, this is not the cause of the myelosuppression in this patient. <br /><br /><b>Nitrofurantoin</b> is a very commonly used antibiotic to manage urinary tract infections. It does not interact with methotrexate, and it can actually be used as an alternative to trimethoprim for the management of those patients on methotrexate. Hence, this could not be the cause of the myelosuppression in this patient.",

        "body": "In 2016 the Chief Medical Officer proposed new guidelines in relation to the safe consumption of alcohol following an expert group report. The most significant change has been a reduction in the number of units it is recommending men do not exceed from 21 to 14, in line with the recommendations for women.<br /><br />The government now recommend the following:<br /><ul><li>men <b>and</b> women should drink no more than 14 units of alcohol per week</li><li>they advise <i>'if you do drink as much as 14 units per week, it is best to spread this evenly over 3 days or more'</i></li><li>pregnant women should not drink. The wording of the official advice is '<i>If you are pregnant or planning a pregnancy, the safest approach is not to drink alcohol at all, to keep risks to your baby to a minimum. Drinking in pregnancy can lead to long-term harm to the baby, with the more you drink the greater the risk.</i>'</li></ul><br />One unit of alcohol is equal to 10 mL of pure ethanol. The 'strength' of an alcoholic drink is determined by the 'alcohol by volume' (ABV).<br /><br />Examples of one unit of alcohol:<br /><ul><li>25ml single measure of spirits (ABV 40%)</li><li>a third of a pint of beer (ABV 5 to 6%)</li><li>half a 175ml 'standard' glass of red wine (ABV 12%)</li></ul><br />To calculate the number of units in a drink multiply the number of millilitres by the ABV and divide by 1,000. For example:<br /><ul><li>half a 175ml 'standard' glass of red wine = 87.5 * 12 / 1000 = 1.05 units</li><li>one bottle of wine = 750 * 12 / 1000 = 9 units</li><li>one pint of 5% beer or lager = 568 * 5 / 1000 = 2.8 units</li></ul>",
