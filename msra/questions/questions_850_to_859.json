            "The correct answer is <b>C6 radiculopathy</b>. The patient's symptoms of neck and arm pain, electric shock-like sensations, and exacerbation on head movement are suggestive of cervical radiculopathy. The decreased sensation on the dorsal aspect of the thumb and index finger corresponds to the dermatomal distribution of the C6 nerve root. Cervical radiculopathy occurs when a nerve root in the cervical spine becomes compressed or irritated, often due to degenerative changes such as disc herniation or osteophyte formation.<br /><br /><b>C4 radiculopathy</b> is an incorrect option because it would present with sensory changes over the shoulder region, rather than the thumb and index finger. Additionally, patients with C4 radiculopathy may experience weakness in shoulder elevation.<br /><br /><b>C5 radiculopathy</b> is also incorrect because it typically presents with sensory changes over the lateral arm and deltoid region. Weakness in shoulder abduction would be expected in a patient with C5 radiculopathy.<br /><br /><b>C7 radiculopathy</b> is not consistent with this patient's presentation because it would cause sensory changes over the middle finger and possibly triceps weakness. The pain experienced by patients with C7 radiculopathy usually radiates down the posterior arm to the dorsum of hand.<br /><br />Finally, <b>T1 radiculopathy</b> is incorrect as it would present with sensory changes over the medial forearm and hand (the ulnar distribution).

            "<b>Coxsackie A16</b> is the correct answer. This child presents with the classic triad of hand, foot and mouth disease: oral ulcers, fever with systemic upset, and vesicles on the palms. Hand, foot and mouth disease is most commonly caused by coxsackie A16, though enterovirus 71 is another important causative agent. Both belong to the Picornaviridae family of intestinal viruses. The condition is highly contagious and typically affects young children, often occurring in nursery outbreaks. The temporal sequence described - with oral ulcers appearing first, followed by vesicles on the extremities - is characteristic. Management is symptomatic with advice about hydration and analgesia. Children do not need exclusion from school unless they are systemically unwell, and parents should be reassured there is no link to foot and mouth disease in cattle.<br /><br /><b>Herpes simplex virus</b> causes gingivostomatitis, which presents with painful oral ulcers and fever in young children. However, HSV typically causes more severe and widespread oral lesions, often affecting the gingivae prominently, and would not cause the characteristic vesicles on the palms and soles. Primary HSV infection may cause systemic symptoms and cervical lymphadenopathy, but the distribution of skin lesions differs significantly from this presentation.<br /><br /><b>Epstein-Barr virus</b> causes infectious mononucleosis, which can present with pharyngitis and oral lesions. However, EBV is more common in adolescents and young adults rather than toddlers. The clinical picture typically includes severe pharyngitis with tonsillar exudate, generalised lymphadenopathy, hepatosplenomegaly, and fatigue lasting weeks. The characteristic palmar vesicles described would not be expected with EBV infection.<br /><br /><b>Varicella zoster virus</b> causes chickenpox, which presents with a vesicular rash and fever. However, the distribution is characteristically centripetal (trunk, face, then spreading to extremities) rather than affecting the palms and soles specifically. The rash progresses through stages from macules to papules to vesicles to crusts, with lesions at different stages present simultaneously. Oral lesions can occur but are not the predominant feature.<br /><br /><b>Parvovirus B19</b> causes erythema infectiosum (fifth disease), characterised by a 'slapped cheek' appearance followed by a reticular rash on the trunk and limbs. While it can cause fever and mild systemic symptoms, it does not typically cause oral ulcers or palmar vesicles. The rash is maculopapular rather than vesicular, and the clinical presentation differs significantly from this case.",

            "The correct answer is <b>Start oral alendronate + ensure calcium and vitamin D replete</b>. This is because the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) guidelines in the UK recommend that patients over the age of 65 who are starting long-term corticosteroid therapy should be co-prescribed a bisphosphonate, such as alendronate, to prevent glucocorticoid-induced osteoporosis. In addition, ensuring adequate intake of calcium and vitamin D is important to support bone health.<br /><br />The option <b>Arrange a DEXA scan</b> is not the most appropriate initial approach. Dual-energy x-ray absorptiometry (DEXA) scans are used to measure bone mineral density and diagnose osteoporosis. However, in this case, it's more appropriate to start preventive treatment immediately due to the patient's age and the known risk associated with long-term steroid use.<br /><br /><b>Ensure calcium and vitamin D replete</b> alone would not provide sufficient protection against steroid-induced osteoporosis in this high-risk patient. While adequate levels of calcium and vitamin D are important for bone health, they will not prevent the rapid bone loss associated with corticosteroid therapy.<br /><br />The option <b>Do a FRAX assessment</b> is also incorrect. The Fracture Risk Assessment Tool (FRAX) calculates an individual's 10-year probability of hip fracture or major osteoporotic fracture based on various risk factors. However, again, given this patient's age and planned long-term corticosteroid use, immediate preventive treatment is recommended rather than waiting for a FRAX score.<br /><br />Lastly, <b>Reassess fracture risk after 3 months</b> would delay necessary preventative treatment for this patient. Given her age and medication regimen, she should be started on a bisphosphonate immediately rather than waiting three months to reassess her risk.<br />",

        "body": "We know that one of the most <span class=\"concept\" data-cid=\"4392\">important risk factors for osteoporosis is the use of corticosteroids</span>. As these drugs are so widely used in clinical practice it is important we manage this risk appropriately. <br /><br />The most widely followed guidelines are based around the 2002 Royal College of Physicians (RCP) 'Glucocorticoid-induced osteoporosis: A concise guide to prevention and treatment'.<br /><br />The risk of osteoporosis is thought to rise significantly once a patient is taking the equivalent of prednisolone 7.5mg a day for 3 or more months. It is important to note that we should manage patients in an anticipatory, i.e. if it likely that the patient will have to take steroids for at least 3 months then we should <span class=\"concept\" data-cid=\"369\">start bone protection straight away</span>, rather than waiting until 3 months has elapsed. A good example is a patient with newly diagnosed polymyalgia rheumatica. As it is very likely they will be on a significant dose of prednisolone for greater than 3 months bone protection should be commenced immediately.<br /><br /><h5 class='notes-heading'>Management of patients at risk of corticosteroid-induced osteoporosis</h5><br />The RCP guidelines essentially divide patients into two groups.<br /><br />1. Patients over the age of 65 years or those who've previously had a fragility fracture should be offered bone protection. <br /><br />2. Patients under the age of 65 years should be offered a bone density scan, with further management dependent:<br /><br /><div class=\"table-responsive\"><table class = \"tlarge table table-striped table-bordered\"  data-role=\"table\" id=\"tableid1\" ><thead><tr><th>T score</th><th>Management</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Greater than 0</td><td>Reassure</td></tr><tr><td>Between 0 and -1.5</td><td>Repeat bone density scan in 1-3 years</td></tr><tr><td>Less than -1.5</td><td>Offer bone protection</td></tr></tbody></table></div><br />The first-line treatment is alendronate.

It commonly presents with hip/groin pain worse on prolonged sitting and associated with snapping, clicking or locking of the hip.
