            "This question concerns the topic of primary amenorrhoea. In this scenario the patient appears well but is suffering cyclical pain with no evidence of menstruation. This rules out a number of answers such as mullerian agenesis and constitutional delay which are both classically painless. Turner syndrome is an unlikely answer as these patients often have distinctive features and associated health problems such as the 'webbed neck', 'lymphoedema', 'shield chest' and 'widely spaced nipples'.

            "The correct answer is <b>9 months</b>. On average, most infants start crawling at around 9 months of age.

Some babies may start as early as 6 months, while others might not crawl until 10 or 11 months, or even later.<br /><br />Discussing the other options, <b>6 months</b> is typically too early for most children to begin crawling. At this stage, many infants are still working on basic motor skills such as rolling over and sitting up independently. <br /><br />The option of <b>12 months</b> could be seen as late for crawling but it's not unheard of. Some babies may skip crawling altogether and move directly to standing and walking. It's also important to remember that premature babies may reach this and other milestones later than their peers.<br /><br /><b>18 months</b> is quite late for a child to start crawling.

            "The correct answer is <b>Bendroflumethiazide</b>. Lithium toxicity can be precipitated by anything that reduces the renal clearance of lithium. Bendroflumethiazide is a thiazide diuretic that works in the distal convoluted tubule of the kidney to inhibit sodium reabsorption, leading to increased water excretion. However, it also decreases lithium excretion and therefore increases the risk of lithium toxicity. Symptoms may include confusion, ataxia, or even seizures and coma in severe cases.<br /><br /><b>Sodium valproate</b> is an antiepileptic drug that can also be used in bipolar disorder as a mood stabiliser. It does not significantly affect renal function or lithium excretion, so it's unlikely to precipitate lithium toxicity.<br /><br /><b>Atenolol</b> is a beta-blocker used primarily for hypertension and angina. While other drugs affecting renal blood flow (like non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs) can potentially increase lithium levels, beta-blockers like atenolol do not have a significant impact on lithium metabolism or excretion.<br /><br /><b>Aminophylline</b> is a bronchodilator used in asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). It has no known interactions with lithium and does not affect its renal clearance.<br /><br />Finally, <b>Sodium bicarbonate</b>, while being an important component of some emergency treatments (such as tricyclic antidepressant overdose), does not interact significantly with lithium.

First, given his age and the time frame in question (one year) his cognitive decline would make you suspicious of a dementia process. Then the more specific symptoms of a visual hallucinations (involving an animal) is highly suggestive of lewy-body dementia. Finally, the reducing movement and increased rate of falls could point towards a parkinsonism which further points towards the correct answer of Lewy-body dementia.",

            "<b>Progestogen-only implant</b> is correct. This is one of the most effective forms of contraception available. It is suitable for all BMIs, although there is some evidence efficacy may be reduced in extremely raised BMIs. The most important contraindications include unexplained vaginal bleeding, severe liver disease and breast cancer, none of which this woman has. If travelling this is a good option as it is long-acting (3 years) and does not require regular visits or prescriptions. It is also not affected by a uterine abnormality. <br /><br /><b>Combined oral contraceptive pill</b> is incorrect. This woman has migraines with aura. This is an absolute contraindication (UKMEC 4). Her BMI is also above 35 which is a UKMEC 3 contraindication. Furthermore, a pill may not be the best choice for someone travelling as it can be hard to time the pill taking when crossing time zones and not following a normal routine. <br /><br /><b>Depot medroxyprogesterone acetate injection</b> is incorrect. Whilst high BMI is not a contraindication there is some evidence that the injection causes weight gain. This would be suboptimal for an obese patient. It also requires injection every 3 months which may be difficult if the patient is away travelling. Finally, the return to fertility can be delayed which needs to be discussed when prescribing for women who have not completed their family. <br /><br /><b>Levonorgestrel-releasing intrauterine system</b> is incorrect. She has fibroids distorting her uterine cavity which is UKMEC 3, meaning the risks outweigh the benefits. As such, this would not be appropriate in her case. <br /><br /><b>Progesterone only pill</b> is incorrect. Whilst this would be a good option, it would be less effective than an implant, and as per her wishes, she has requested the most efficacious option. Alongside this, she is unlikely to be able to access prescriptions while travelling, making this less suitable. The progesterone-only pill also has a narrow window of administration and adhering to this may be difficult, particularly with changing time zones and a lack of routine. This would make the risk of having missed pills and reduced efficacy higher.",
