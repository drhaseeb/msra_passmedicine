            "<b>Chest x-ray</b> is the correct answer. Erythema nodosum is a panniculitis (inflammation of subcutaneous fat) that is often a reaction to an underlying systemic condition. Therefore, once the diagnosis is made clinically, the priority is to investigate for a trigger. A chest x-ray is a crucial first-line investigation in all patients presenting with erythema nodosum, regardless of respiratory symptoms. It is used to screen for two of the most important causes: sarcoidosis (which classically presents with bilateral hilar lymphadenopathy) and tuberculosis. In this scenario, the patient's history of a persistent dry cough makes this investigation even more pertinent, as it could be a symptom of either of these conditions. Other potential findings on a chest x-ray could include lymphoma or other infections. Given the significant potential underlying pathologies, a chest x-ray is an essential part of the initial workup.<br /><br /><b>Throat swab</b> is an incorrect choice. A throat swab for Group A streptococcus is a reasonable investigation in the workup of erythema nodosum, as streptococcal pharyngitis is one of the most common triggers, particularly in children and young adults. However, this patient's primary associated symptom is a cough, not a sore throat, making a respiratory pathology a higher priority to investigate first. While a subclinical streptococcal infection is possible, investigating the overt symptom of a cough with a chest x-ray takes precedence.<br /><br /><b>Skin biopsy</b> is not the most appropriate next step. The clinical presentation of tender, erythematous nodules on the shins is classical for erythema nodosum, and the diagnosis can usually be made clinically. A skin biopsy is an invasive procedure and is typically reserved for cases where the diagnosis is uncertain or the lesions are atypical (e.g., ulcerating, located in unusual sites, or persistent). As the clinical picture here is typical, the focus should be on identifying the underlying cause rather than confirming the diagnosis histologically.<br /><br /><b>Faecal calprotectin</b> is an incorrect option. Faecal calprotectin is a sensitive marker for intestinal inflammation and is used in the investigation of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), such as Crohn's disease or ulcerative colitis. IBD is a well-recognised cause of erythema nodosum. However, this investigation is only indicated if there are accompanying gastrointestinal symptoms, such as diarrhoea, abdominal pain, or weight loss. This patient has no such symptoms, making this test low yield at this stage.<br /><br /><b>Antinuclear antibody</b> (ANA) is not the most appropriate initial investigation. An ANA test is used to screen for autoimmune connective tissue diseases, such as Systemic Lupus Erythematosus (SLE). While skin manifestations can occur in these conditions, erythema nodosum is not a classic feature of SLE, and there are no other signs or symptoms in the history (e.g., photosensitive rash, arthritis, serositis) to suggest an underlying connective tissue disease. Therefore, this is not a primary investigation in the workup of isolated erythema nodosum.",

        "title": "Transient ischaemic attack",
        "body": "A transient ischaemic attack (TIA), as the name suggests, is a brief period of neurological deficit due to a vascular cause, typically lasting less than an hour. The National Clinical Guideline for Stroke was published in 2023 and made a number of updated recommendations, including the use of dual antiplatelet therapy (DAPT). It should be noted that DAPT is not currently recommended for 'major' ischaemic stroke as the risk of haemorrhagic transformation is too high.<br /><br />The original definition of a TIA was time-based: a sudden onset of a focal neurologic symptom and/or sign lasting less than 24 hours, brought on by a transient decrease in blood flow. However, this has now changed as it is recognised that even short periods of ischaemia can result in pathological changes to the brain. Therefore, a new '<b>tissue-based'</b> definition is now used: <span class=\"concept\" data-cid=\"9800\">a transient episode of neurologic dysfunction caused by focal brain, spinal cord, or retinal ischaemia, without acute infarction.</span> <a href='https://radiopaedia.org/articles/transient-ischaemic-attack?lang=gb#:~:text=without%20acute%20infarction.-,Terminology,-In%20the%20past' title='Radiopaedia - Transient ischaemic attack' target='_blank' class='badge rounded-pill text-bg-light deeplink'>REF</a> <br /><br />Patients often use the term 'mini-stroke' for TIAs.<br /><br /><h5 class='notes-heading'>Clinical features</h5><br />The clinical features are similar to those of a stroke, i.e. sudden onset, focal neurological deficit but, rather than persisting, the features resolve, typically within 1 hour.<br /><br />Possible features include<br /><ul><li>unilateral weakness or sensory loss.</li><li>aphasia or dysarthria</li><li>ataxia, vertigo, or loss of balance</li><li>visual problems<ul><li>sudden transient loss of vision in one eye (amaurosis fugax)</li><li>diplopia</li><li>homonymous hemianopia</li></ul></li></ul><br /><h5 class='notes-heading'>Assessment and referral</h5><br />Patients with acute focal neurological symptoms that resolve completely within 24 hours of onset (i.e. suspected TIA) should:  <br /><ul><li>be given <span class=\"concept\" data-cid=\"12219\">aspirin 300 mg</span> immediately unless contraindicated </li><li>assessed urgently within 24 hours by a stroke specialist clinician</li></ul><br />Examples of TIA mimics that require exclusion<br /><ul><li><span class=\"concept\" data-cid=\"3993\">hypoglycaemia</span></li><li>intracranial haemorrhage<ul><li>all <span class=\"concept\" data-cid=\"4061\">patients on anticoagulants or with similar risk factors should be admitted for urgent imaging to exclude haemorrhage</span></li></ul></li></ul><br />If a patient presents more than 7 days ago they should be seen by a stroke specialist clinician as soon as possible within 7 days.<br /><br />The <span class=\"concept\" data-cid=\"1684\">ABCD2 prognostic score</span> has previously been used to risk stratify patients who present with a suspected TIA.

            "The correct answer is <b>Rheumatoid factor negative</b>. Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is a chronic, systemic inflammatory disorder that primarily affects the synovial joints. The presence of rheumatoid factor (RF) in patients with RA is generally associated with a more severe disease course, including higher rates of joint erosions and extra-articular manifestations. Therefore, being RF-negative can be associated with a milder disease course and thus a better prognosis.<br /><br /><b>HLA DR4</b> is incorrect as it is associated with susceptibility to RA rather than its prognosis. HLA-DR4 positive individuals have been found to be at an increased risk of developing RA but its presence does not necessarily indicate the severity or prognosis of the disease.<br /><br /><b>Anti-CCP antibodies</b> are also related to the diagnosis of RA rather than its prognosis. Anti-cyclic citrullinated peptide (anti-CCP) antibodies are highly specific for RA and can be present years before the onset of clinical symptoms. However, similar to RF, their presence has been linked with more severe disease progression and poorer outcomes.<br /><br /><b>Rheumatoid nodules</b>, which are firm subcutaneous nodules that often develop in areas subjected to pressure, are typically associated with more severe disease and hence do not indicate a good prognosis in RA. They are most commonly found in patients who are also RF-positive.<br /><br />Finally, an <b>insidious onset</b> does not necessarily predict a good prognosis in RA. While it's true that a slower onset might delay diagnosis and treatment initiation, this doesn't translate into better long-term outcomes. In fact, early aggressive treatment regardless of onset speed has been shown to improve long-term outcomes by preventing irreversible joint damage.",
