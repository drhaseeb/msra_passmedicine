Breast massage may also be tried</li><li>nipple candidiasis: <span class=\"concept\" data-cid=\"9817\">treatment for nipple candidiasis whilst breastfeeding should involve miconazole cream for the mother and nystatin suspension for the baby</span></li></ul><br /><br /><h5 class='notes-heading'>Mastitis</h5><br />Mastitis affects around 1 in 10 breastfeeding women. The BNF advises to treat 'if systemically unwell, if nipple fissure present, if symptoms do not improve after 12-24 hours of effective milk removal of if culture indicates infection'. The first-line antibiotic is flucloxacillin for 10-14 days. Breastfeeding or expressing should continue during treatment.<br /><br />If left untreated, mastitis may develop into a breast abscess. This generally requires incision and drainage.<br /><br /><br /><h5 class='notes-heading'>Engorgement</h5><br />Breast engorgement is one of the causes of breast pain in breastfeeding women. It usually occurs in the first few days after the infant is born and almost always affects both breasts. The pain or discomfort is typically worse just before a feed. Milk tends to not flow well from an engorged breast and the infant may find it difficult to attach and suckle. Fever may be present but usually settles within 24 hours. The breasts may appear red. Complications include blocked milk ducts, mastitis and difficulties with breastfeeding and, subsequently, milk supply. <br /><br />Although it may initially be painful, hand expression of milk may help relieve the discomfort of engorgement.<br /><br /><br /><h5 class='notes-heading'>Raynaud's disease of the nipple</h5><br />In <span class=\"concept\" data-cid=\"9812\">Raynaud's disease of the nipple, pain is often intermittent and present during and immediately after feeding</span>. Blanching of the nipple may be followed by cyanosis and/or erythema. Nipple pain resolves when nipples return to normal colour. <br /><br />Options of treatment for Raynaud's disease of the nipple include advice on minimising exposure to cold, use of heat packs following a breastfeed, avoiding caffeine and stopping smoking. If symptoms persist consider specialist referral for a trial of oral nifedipine (off-license).<br /><br /><br /><h5 class='notes-heading'>Concerns about poor infant weight gain</h5><br />Around 1 in 10 breastfed babies lose more than the 'cut-off' 10% threshold in the first week of life. This should prompt consideration of the above breastfeeding problems. The infant should also be examined to look for any underlying problems. <span class=\"concept\" data-cid=\"11141\">NICE recommends an 'expert' review of feeding if this occurs (e.g. midwife-led breastfeeding clinics)</span> and monitoring of weight until weight gain is satisfactory",

            "The correct answer is <b>Adenocarcinoma</b>. In patients with long-standing gastro-oesophageal reflux disease (GORD), chronic exposure of the distal oesophagus to acidic gastric contents leads to metaplastic changes known as Barrett's oesophagus. This condition significantly increases the risk of developing oesophageal adenocarcinoma. The patient's 10-year history of GORD and presentation with dysphagia (a red flag symptom) strongly suggests malignant transformation of Barrett's oesophagus to adenocarcinoma.<br /><br /><b>Squamous cell carcinoma</b> is incorrect because although it is a common type of oesophageal cancer, it typically occurs in the upper and middle thirds of the oesophagus and is more commonly associated with smoking, alcohol consumption, and hot beverage consumption rather than GORD. It is more prevalent in developing countries and parts of Asia.<br /><br /><b>Normal squamous epithelium</b> is incorrect because the presence of an obstructive lesion on endoscopy indicates pathological changes. Normal squamous epithelium would not cause obstruction or dysphagia, and given the patient's history and symptoms, this finding would be highly unlikely.<br /><br /><b>Leiomyoma</b> is incorrect because although it is the most common benign tumour of the oesophagus, it typically presents as a smooth submucosal lesion rather than an obstructive mass. Furthermore, leiomyomas are not associated with GORD and are usually asymptomatic when small.<br /><br /><b>Metaplastic columnar epithelium</b> is incorrect because while this finding (Barrett's oesophagus) is indeed a precursor to adenocarcinoma and would be expected in someone with chronic GORD, the presence of an obstructive lesion suggests progression to malignancy rather than just metaplastic changes.

        "question": "A 45-year-old male informs his GP that he is feeling unwell. He has a past medical history of osteoarthritis and he has recently started taking ibuprofen over the counter. He also has bipolar disorder, for which he takes lithium and sodium valproate orally. <br /><br />He reports diarrhoea, vomiting, abdominal pain and blurred vision. On examination, his observations are within normal ranges, but you observe a coarse tremor and some muscle twitching. Neurological examination also reveals hyperreflexia. Abdominal examination reveals a mildly tender abdomen with no signs of peritonitis.<br /><br />There has been no recent changes in his medication. He informs you that he is fasting for religious reasons but is still taking all of his medication.<br /><br />What is the most likely cause of his current presentation?",

            "The correct answer is <b>22 - 26 cm</b>. Symphysis-fundal height (SFH) is a measure of the size of the uterus used to assess fetal growth and development. It is measured from the pubic symphysis to the top of the uterus (the fundus). In centimetres, it should roughly equal the gestational age in weeks after 20 weeks of gestation, hence at 24 weeks, it should be around 24 cm, but with a generally acceptable range between 22 - 26 cm.<br /><br /><b>13 - 15 cm</b> would be too small for a pregnancy at this gestational age. This could suggest intrauterine growth restriction or other complications such as oligohydramnios or placental insufficiency which are conditions where there's not enough amniotic fluid or the placenta isn't functioning properly.<br /><br /><b>15 - 17 cm</b>, similar to above, is also below the expected SFH for a woman who is 24 weeks pregnant. Again, this could indicate potential issues with fetal growth and would warrant further investigation.<br /><br />A measurement of <b>17 - 19 cm</b>, while closer to what might be expected, is still lower than usual for this stage of pregnancy. It may suggest that the fetus is smaller than average for its gestational age.<br /><br />Finally, <b>18 - 22 cm</b>, although closer to what we would expect at this stage, it's still on the lower end. This could potentially indicate that further assessment may be needed if coupled with other concerning signs or symptoms.",
