        "question": "A 19-year-old man presents with episodes of dyspnoea, starting suddenly, often when he is in a crowded room.  When breathless he also notices tingling around his mouth and he feels light-headed.  An arterial sample was taken for blood gases during one of the episodes. <br /><br />What would you expect the arterial blood gas (ABG) sample to show?",
