        "title": "Breast cancer: management",
        "body": "The management of breast cancer depends on the staging, tumour type and patient background. It may involve any of the following:<br /><ul><li>surgery</li><li>radiotherapy</li><li>hormone therapy</li><li>biological therapy</li><li>chemotherapy</li></ul><br /><h5 class='notes-heading'>Surgery</h5><br />The vast majority of patients who have breast cancer diagnosed will be offered surgery. An exception may be a very frail, elderly lady with metastatic disease who may be better managed with hormonal therapy.<br /><br />Prior to surgery, the presence/absence of axillary lymphadenopathy determines management:<br /><ul><li><span class=\"concept\" data-cid=\"10185\">women with no palpable axillary lymphadenopathy at presentation should have a pre-operative axillary ultrasound</span> before their primary surgery<ul><li><span class=\"concept\" data-cid=\"10186\">if negative then they should have a sentinel node biopsy to assess the nodal burden</span></li></ul></li><li><span class=\"concept\" data-cid=\"10189\">in patients with breast cancer who present with clinically palpable lymphadenopathy, axillary node clearance is indicated at primary surgery</span><ul><li><span class=\"concept\" data-cid=\"10191\">this may lead to arm lymphedema and functional arm impairment</span></li></ul></li></ul><br />Depending on the characteristics of the tumour women either have a wide-local excision or a mastectomy. Around two-thirds of tumours can be removed with a wide-local excision. The table below lists some of the factors determining which operation is offered:<br /><br /><div class=\"table-responsive\"><table class = \"tlarge table table-striped table-bordered\"  data-role=\"table\" id=\"tableid1\" ><thead><tr><th><b>Mastectomy</b></th><th><b>Wide Local Excision</b></th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Multifocal tumour</td><td>Solitary lesion</td></tr><tr><td>Central tumour</td><td>Peripheral tumour</td></tr><tr><td>Large lesion in small breast</td><td>Small lesion in large breast</td></tr><tr><td>DCIS > 4cm</td><td>DCIS < 4cm</td></tr></tbody></table></div><br />Women should be offered breast reconstruction to achieve a cosmetically suitable result regardless of the type of operation they have. For women who've had a mastectomy this may be done at the initial operation or at a later date.<br /><br /><h5 class='notes-heading'>Radiotherapy</h5><br /><span class=\"concept\" data-cid=\"9151\">Whole breast radiotherapy is recommended after a woman has had a wide-local excision as this may reduce the risk of recurrence by around two-thirds</span>. For women who've had a mastectomy radiotherapy is offered for T3-T4 tumours and for those with four or more positive axillary nodes<br /><br /><h5 class='notes-heading'>Hormonal therapy</h5><br />Adjuvant hormonal therapy is offered if tumours are positive for hormone receptors. For many years this was done using tamoxifen for 5 years after diagnosis. <span class=\"concept\" data-cid=\"3967\">Tamoxifen is still used in pre- and peri-menopausal women</span>. In <span class=\"concept\" data-cid=\"1261\">post-menopausal women, aromatase inhibitors such as anastrozole</span> are used for this purpose*. This is important as aromatisation accounts for the majority of oestrogen production in post-menopausal women and therefore anastrozole is used for ER +ve breast cancer in this group. <br /><br />Important side effects of tamoxifen include an increased risk of endometrial cancer, venous thromboembolism and menopausal symptoms.<br /><br /><h5 class='notes-heading'>Biological therapy</h5><br />The most common type of biological therapy used for breast cancer is <span class=\"concept\" data-cid=\"3966\">trastuzumab (Herceptin)</span>. It is only useful in the 20-25% of tumours that are <span class=\"concept\" data-cid=\"3966\">HER2 positive</span>.<br /><br />Trastuzumab cannot be used in patients with a history of heart disorders.<br /><br /><h5 class='notes-heading'>Chemotherapy</h5><br />Cytotoxic therapy may be used either prior to surgery ('neoadjuvanant' chemotherapy) to <span class=\"concept\" data-cid=\"10193\">downstage a primary lesion</span> or after surgery depending on the stage of the tumour, for example, if there is <span class=\"concept\" data-cid=\"3968\">axillary node disease - FEC-D is used in this situation</span>.",

This recommendation reflects reduced efficacy of ACE inhibitors and ARBs in this population due to lower renin levels. The scenario ensures there are no contraindications (normal renal function, no proteinuria) and no comorbidities that would alter management, making a calcium channel blocker clearly preferred.<br /><br /><b>ACE inhibitor</b> is less effective as initial monotherapy in patients of black African or African-Caribbean origin without diabetes-related nephropathy due to differences in underlying pathophysiology\u2014primarily low-renin hypertension. NICE specifically advises against their use as first-line agents in this group unless there are other indications such as diabetic nephropathy.<br /><br /><b>Angiotensin receptor blocker</b>, while occasionally used instead of ACE inhibitors when these aren\u2019t tolerated (e.g., cough), shares similar limitations regarding initial efficacy in this patient group. It may be considered later if combination therapy is required but is not recommended as the sole first agent here.<br /><br /><b>Beta-blocker</b> is not recommended for routine initial treatment of hypertension except where there are specific additional indications such as angina or heart failure, which are absent here. Beta-blockers also confer less protection against stroke compared to other classes when used alone for primary hypertension.<br /><br /><b>Thiazide-like diuretic</b> can be considered at step two if blood pressure control isn\u2019t achieved with a calcium channel blocker alone; however, it is not advised by NICE for first-line use unless both calcium channel blockers and ACE inhibitors/ARBs are unsuitable or contraindicated.",

The scenario ensures there are no contraindications (normal renal function, no proteinuria) and no comorbidities that would alter management, making a calcium channel blocker clearly preferred.<br /><br /><b>ACE inhibitor</b> is less effective as initial monotherapy in patients of black African or African-Caribbean origin without diabetes-related nephropathy due to differences in underlying pathophysiology\u2014primarily low-renin hypertension. NICE specifically advises against their use as first-line agents in this group unless there are other indications such as diabetic nephropathy.<br /><br /><b>Angiotensin receptor blocker</b>, while occasionally used instead of ACE inhibitors when these aren\u2019t tolerated (e.g., cough), shares similar limitations regarding initial efficacy in this patient group. It may be considered later if combination therapy is required but is not recommended as the sole first agent here.<br /><br /><b>Beta-blocker</b> is not recommended for routine initial treatment of hypertension except where there are specific additional indications such as angina or heart failure, which are absent here. Beta-blockers also confer less protection against stroke compared to other classes when used alone for primary hypertension.<br /><br /><b>Thiazide-like diuretic</b> can be considered at step two if blood pressure control isn\u2019t achieved with a calcium channel blocker alone; however, it is not advised by NICE for first-line use unless both calcium channel blockers and ACE inhibitors/ARBs are unsuitable or contraindicated.",

        "body": "Degenerative cervical myelopathy (DCM) has a number of risk factors, which include smoking due to its effects on the intervertebral discs, genetics and occupation - those exposing patients to high axial loading [1]. <br /><br />The presentation of DCM is very variable. Early symptoms are often subtle and can vary in severity day to day, making the disease difficult to detect initially. However as a progressive condition, worsening, deteriorating or new symptoms should be a warning sign.<br /><br />DCM symptoms can include any combination of [1]: <br /><ul><li>Pain (affecting the neck, upper or lower limbs)</li><li>Loss of motor function (loss of digital dexterity, preventing simple tasks such as holding a fork or doing up their shirt buttons, arm or leg weakness/stiffness leading to impaired gait and imbalance</li><li>Loss of sensory function causing numbness</li><li>Loss of autonomic function (urinary or faecal incontinence and/or impotence) - these can occur and do not necessarily suggest cauda equina syndrome in the absence of other hallmarks of that condition</li><li>Hoffman's sign: is a reflex test to assess for cervical myelopathy. It is performed by gently flicking one finger on a patient's hand. A positive test results in reflex twitching of the other fingers on the same hand in response to the flick. </li></ul><br />The most common symptoms at presentation of DCM are unknown, but in one series 50% of patients were initially incorrectly diagnosed and sometimes treated for carpal tunnel syndrome [2].<br /><br />An MRI of the cervical spine is the gold standard test where cervical myelopathy is suspected. It may reveal disc degeneration and ligament hypertrophy, with accompanying cord signal change.<br /><br />All patients with degenerative cervical myelopathy should be urgently referred for assessment by specialist spinal services (neurosurgery or orthopaedic spinal surgery). This is due to the importance of early treatment. The timing of surgery is important, as any existing spinal cord damage can be permanent. Early treatment (within 6 months of diagnosis) offers the best chance of a full recovery but at present, most patients are presenting too late. In one study, patients averaged over 5 appointments before diagnosis, representing >2 years. <br /><br />Currently, decompressive surgery is the only effective treatment. It has been shown to prevent disease progression. Close observation is an option for mild stable disease, but anything progressive or more severe requires surgery to prevent further deterioration. Physiotherapy should only be initiated by specialist services, as manipulation can cause more spinal cord damage. <br /><br />References<br />1. Baron EM, Young WF.

            "<b>Switch to a low-dose ICS/formoterol combination inhaler</b> is the correct answer. This patient's asthma is uncontrolled, as evidenced by their use of a short-acting beta-agonist (SABA) more than twice a week and nocturnal symptoms. The 2024 joint NICE/BTS/SIGN guidelines represent a significant change in asthma management. For patients aged 12 and over who are symptomatic on a regular low-dose inhaled corticosteroid (ICS) with a SABA as required, the recommended next step is to switch to a low-dose ICS/formoterol combination inhaler to be used for both maintenance and reliever therapy (MART). The MART approach involves the patient taking a regular daily maintenance dose and also using the same inhaler for symptom relief as needed. This strategy has been shown to reduce the risk of severe exacerbations compared to traditional regimens, as it ensures that an anti-inflammatory (the ICS component) is delivered whenever the reliever is used. This patient fits the criteria for this change perfectly.<br /><br /><b>Add a separate long-acting beta-agonist inhaler</b> is incorrect. While adding a long-acting beta-agonist (LABA) to an ICS was the standard 'step 3' in previous UK asthma guidelines, this is no longer the recommended first-line approach for stepping up treatment. The new guidelines favour switching to a combination ICS/formoterol inhaler for MART. The rationale is that using a single combination inhaler for both maintenance and relief is more effective at preventing exacerbations and is more convenient for patients, which may improve adherence. Adding a separate LABA while continuing a SABA for relief misses the key benefit of the anti-inflammatory reliever strategy.<br /><br /><b>Add a leukotriene receptor antagonist</b> is incorrect at this stage. A leukotriene receptor antagonist (LTRA), such as montelukast, is a potential add-on therapy for asthma. However, according to the new guidelines, it is not the initial step-up for a patient inadequately controlled on a low-dose ICS. An LTRA is now considered as a trial therapy at Step 4, for patients whose asthma is not controlled on a moderate-dose MART regimen. It is therefore an inappropriate next step for this patient.<br /><br /><b>Increase the dose of the beclometasone inhaler</b> is an incorrect next step. In previous guidelines, increasing the ICS dose (e.g., from low to moderate) was an alternative to adding a LABA. The current evidence and guidelines, however, strongly support the addition of a LABA (specifically formoterol in a combination inhaler for MART) as being more effective for most patients than simply increasing the steroid dose. The benefits of bronchodilation from the LABA component combined with the anti-inflammatory reliever strategy are prioritised over escalating the ICS dose alone at this stage of management.<br /><br /><b>Refer to a respiratory specialist</b> is not indicated at this point. Referral to secondary care is reserved for patients with difficult-to-control or severe asthma. This typically includes individuals whose asthma is not controlled despite treatment with a moderate-dose MART regimen and trials of add-on therapies (Step 5 of the pathway), or those on a high-dose ICS. This patient is at a much earlier stage in their treatment pathway, and there are several primary care management steps that should be taken first.",

This strategy has been shown to reduce the risk of severe exacerbations compared to traditional regimens, as it ensures that an anti-inflammatory (the ICS component) is delivered whenever the reliever is used. This patient fits the criteria for this change perfectly.<br /><br /><b>Add a separate long-acting beta-agonist inhaler</b> is incorrect. While adding a long-acting beta-agonist (LABA) to an ICS was the standard 'step 3' in previous UK asthma guidelines, this is no longer the recommended first-line approach for stepping up treatment. The new guidelines favour switching to a combination ICS/formoterol inhaler for MART. The rationale is that using a single combination inhaler for both maintenance and relief is more effective at preventing exacerbations and is more convenient for patients, which may improve adherence. Adding a separate LABA while continuing a SABA for relief misses the key benefit of the anti-inflammatory reliever strategy.<br /><br /><b>Add a leukotriene receptor antagonist</b> is incorrect at this stage. A leukotriene receptor antagonist (LTRA), such as montelukast, is a potential add-on therapy for asthma. However, according to the new guidelines, it is not the initial step-up for a patient inadequately controlled on a low-dose ICS. An LTRA is now considered as a trial therapy at Step 4, for patients whose asthma is not controlled on a moderate-dose MART regimen. It is therefore an inappropriate next step for this patient.<br /><br /><b>Increase the dose of the beclometasone inhaler</b> is an incorrect next step. In previous guidelines, increasing the ICS dose (e.g., from low to moderate) was an alternative to adding a LABA. The current evidence and guidelines, however, strongly support the addition of a LABA (specifically formoterol in a combination inhaler for MART) as being more effective for most patients than simply increasing the steroid dose. The benefits of bronchodilation from the LABA component combined with the anti-inflammatory reliever strategy are prioritised over escalating the ICS dose alone at this stage of management.<br /><br /><b>Refer to a respiratory specialist</b> is not indicated at this point. Referral to secondary care is reserved for patients with difficult-to-control or severe asthma. This typically includes individuals whose asthma is not controlled despite treatment with a moderate-dose MART regimen and trials of add-on therapies (Step 5 of the pathway), or those on a high-dose ICS. This patient is at a much earlier stage in their treatment pathway, and there are several primary care management steps that should be taken first.",

        "body": "In 2024 NICE, the British Thoracic Society and SIGN produced joint guidelines on the management of asthma following many years of conflicting guidelines. The new guidelines represent a major step change in the management of asthma is both diagnosed and treated.<br /><br />For many years patients with asthma were started on a short-acting beta-2 agonist (SABA) inhaler before 'stepping up' to a regular inhaled corticosteroid with a SABA as required. The new guidelines now advocate the use of combined inhalers (ICS + long-acting beta-2 agonist) as reliever therapy or regularly, depending on the severity of asthma. Given the prevalence of asthma, it is likely that doctors will have to deal with patients on 'conventional' asthma treatments for many years to come. The joint guidelines therefore include guidance on how to manage these patients if their current treatment is controlling their symptoms sufficiently.<br /><br /><h5 class='notes-heading'>Management of adult patients aged children aged \u2265 12 years with newly diagnosed asthma</h5><br />Step 1 <a href='https://www.nice.org.uk/guidance/ng245/chapter/Recommendations#pharmacological-management-in-people-aged-12-and-over:~:text=and%20over.-,Initial%20management%20of%20newly%20diagnosed%20asthma%20in%20people%20aged%2012%20and%20over,-1.7.1' title='NICE - 2024 Asthma: diagnosis, monitoring and chronic asthma management (BTS, NICE, SIGN)' target='_blank' class='badge rounded-pill text-bg-light deeplink'>NICE</a><ul><li>a <span class=\"concept\" data-cid=\"12286\">low-dose inhaled corticosteroid (ICS)/formoterol combination inhaler to be taken as needed for symptom relief</span><ul><li>this is termed anti-inflammatory reliever (AIR) therapy</li></ul></li><li>if the patient presents highly symptomatic (for example, regular nocturnal waking) or with a severe exacerbation:<ul><li><span class=\"concept\" data-cid=\"12295\">start treatment with low-dose MART</span> (maintenance and reliever therapy, see below)</li><li>treat the acute symptoms as appropriate (e.g. a course of oral corticosteroids may be indicated)</li></ul></li></ul><br />Step 2  <a href='https://www.nice.org.uk/guidance/ng245/chapter/Recommendations#pharmacological-management-in-people-aged-12-and-over:~:text=asthma%20management.-,Medicine%20combination%20and%20sequencing%20in%20people%20aged%2012%20and%20over,-For%20guidance%20on' title='NICE - 2024 Asthma: diagnosis, monitoring and chronic asthma management (BTS, NICE, SIGN)' target='_blank' class='badge rounded-pill text-bg-light deeplink'>NICE</a> <br /><ul><li><span class=\"concept\" data-cid=\"12287\">a low-dose MART</span><ul><li>MART describes using an inhaled corticosteroid (ICS)/formoterol combination inhaler for daily maintenance therapy and the relief of symptoms as needed, i.e. regularly and as required</li></ul></li></ul><br />Step 3<br /><ul><li>a <span class=\"concept\" data-cid=\"12288\">moderate-dose MART</span></li></ul><br />Step 4<br /><ul><li><span class=\"concept\" data-cid=\"12289\">check the fractional exhaled nitric oxide (FeNO) level if available, and the blood eosinophil count</span>  <a href='https://www.nice.org.uk/guidance/ng245/chapter/Recommendations#pharmacological-management-in-people-aged-12-and-over:~:text=Check%20the%20fractional%20exhaled%20nitric%20oxide%20(FeNO)%20level%20if%20available' title='NICE - 2024 Asthma: diagnosis, monitoring and chronic asthma management (BTS, NICE, SIGN)' target='_blank' class='badge rounded-pill text-bg-light deeplink'>NICE</a> <ul><li>if <span class=\"concept\" data-cid=\"12290\">either of these is raised, refer to a specialist in asthma care</span></li><li>if <span class=\"concept\" data-cid=\"12291\">neither FeNO nor eosinophil count is raised, consider a trial of either a leukotriene receptor antagonist (LTRA) or a long-acting muscarinic receptor antagonist (LAMA)</span> used in addition to moderate-dose MART</li><li>if control has not improved, stop the LTRA or LAMA and start a trial of the alternative medicine (LTRA or LAMA)</li></ul></li></ul><br />Step 5<br /><ul><li><span class=\"concept\" data-cid=\"12292\">refer people to a specialist in asthma care</span> when asthma is not controlled despite treatment with moderate-dose MART, and trials of an LTRA and a LAMA</li></ul><br /><div class=\"container\"><div class=\"row\"><div class=\"col-md-3\"><a href=\"https://d32xxyeh8kfs8k.cloudfront.net/images_Passmedicine/pdd602b.png\" data-fancybox=\"gallery\" data-caption=\"Algorithm showing pharmacological management of asthma in people aged 12 years and over\"><img  class=\"img-thumbnail mx-auto d-block\" style=\"max-height:150px;margin-bottom:10px;\" src=\"https://d32xxyeh8kfs8k.cloudfront.net/images_Passmedicine/pdd602.png\" alt=\"\" /></a></div></div></div><br /><h5 class='notes-heading'>Transferring people aged 12 and over from other treatment pathways</h5><br />There will be many people whose asthma was managed according to the previous guidelines that present with uncontrolled asthmatic symptoms.
