            "The correct answer is <b>C5-C6</b>. The biceps reflex primarily tests the integrity of the C5 and C6 nerve roots. The reflex is elicited by sharply striking the biceps tendon with a reflex hammer, which should normally cause the arm to flex at the elbow. Absence or decrease of this reflex suggests an issue with these nerve roots.<br /><br />The first incorrect answer is <b>C3-C5</b>. While it's true that these nerve roots contribute to the innervation of the shoulder muscles and participate in some arm movements, they don't directly correlate with the biceps reflex. The primary nerves involved in this action are part of the brachial plexus, particularly those stemming from C5 and C6.<br /><br /><b>T3-T5</b> is another incorrect option. These thoracic nerve roots have no direct involvement in upper limb motor function or reflexes. Instead, they provide innervation to parts of the chest wall and abdominal musculature.<br /><br /><b>T7-T8</b> are also not responsible for eliciting the biceps reflex. Similar to T3-T5, these thoracic nerve roots supply parts of the abdominal wall and have no direct role in upper limb motor function or reflexes.<br /><br />Lastly, <b>C7-C8</b> is incorrect as well.

            "The correct answer is <b>Hypertension and bradycardia</b>, which represents the classic Cushing's triad (hypertension, bradycardia, and irregular breathing) seen in raised intracranial pressure (ICP). In this scenario, the patient has likely developed an extradural haematoma following the trauma, leading to increased ICP. The body responds to this through the Cushing reflex, a physiological response aimed at maintaining cerebral perfusion pressure. As ICP rises, there is activation of sympathetic pathways leading to systemic vasoconstriction and hypertension. The hypertension then triggers a baroreceptor-mediated reflex bradycardia.<br /><br /><b>Hypotension and tachycardia</b> is incorrect as this combination typically indicates hypovolaemic shock or significant blood loss, which is not the primary concern in this case. While the patient may have other injuries, the deteriorating GCS suggests an intracranial pathology.<br /><br /><b>Hypotension and bradycardia</b> is incorrect as this combination typically suggests cardiogenic shock or a vagal response. This would not be expected in a case of rising ICP where hypertension is a characteristic finding.<br /><br /><b>Hypertension and tachycardia</b> is incorrect because while hypertension is part of the Cushing reflex, tachycardia is not. The baroreceptor reflex in response to hypertension actually causes bradycardia, not tachycardia.<br /><br /><b>Normotension and bradycardia</b> is incorrect because in significant raised ICP, the compensatory mechanism requires hypertension to maintain cerebral perfusion pressure. Normotension with bradycardia might be seen in other conditions such as carotid sinus hypersensitivity but would not be typical of raised ICP.",

        "body": "VTEs can cause severe morbidity and mortality, but they are preventable. Current NICE guidelines (updated for 2018) outline recommendations for assessment and management of patients at risk of VTE in hospital. <br /><br /><br /><h5 class='notes-heading'>Risk factors</h5><br />All patients admitted to hospital should be individually assessed to identify risk factors for VTE development and bleeding risk. For medical and surgical patients the recommended risk proforma is the department of healths VTE risk assessment tool.<br /><br />The following inpatients would be deemed at increased risk of developing a VTE:<br /><br />Medical patients:<br /><ul><li>significant reduction in mobility for 3 days or more (or anticipated to have significantly reduced mobility)</li></ul><br />Surgical/trauma patients:<br /><ul><li>hip/knee replacement</li><li>hip fracture</li><li>general anaesthetic and a surgical duration of over 90 minutes</li><li>surgery of the pelvis or lower limb with a general anaesthetic and a surgical duration of over 60 minutes</li><li>acute surgical admission with an inflammatory/intra-abdominal condition</li><li>surgery with a significant reduction in mobility</li></ul><br />General risk factors:<br /><ul><li>active cancer/chemotherapy</li><li>aged over 60</li><li>known blood clotting disorder (e.g. thrombophilia)</li><li>BMI over 35</li><li>dehydration</li><li>one or more significant medical comorbidities (e.g. heart disease; metabolic/endocrine pathologies; respiratory disease; acute infectious disease and inflammatory conditions)</li><li>critical care admission</li><li>use of hormone replacement therapy (HRT)</li><li>use of the combined oral contraceptive pill</li><li>varicose veins</li><li>pregnant or less than 6 weeks post-partum</li></ul><br />After a patients VTE risk has been assessed, this should be compared to their risk of bleeding to decide whether VTE prophylaxis should be offered. If indicated VTE prophylaxis should be started as soon as possible. <br /><br /><br /><h5 class='notes-heading'>Types of VTE prophylaxis</h5><br />Mechanical:<br /><ul><li>Correctly fitted anti-embolism (aka compression) stockings (thigh or knee height)</li><li>An Intermittent pneumatic compression device</li></ul><br />Pharmacological:<br /><ul><li>Fondaparinux sodium (SC injection)</li><li>Low molecular weight heparin (LMWH)<ul><li>e.g. enoxaparin</li><li>reduced doses should be used in patients with severe renal impairment</li></ul></li><li>Unfractionated heparin (UFH)<ul><li>used as an alternative to LWMH in patients with chronic kidney disease</li></ul></li></ul><br /><br /><h5 class='notes-heading'>Management</h5><br />In general, all medical patients deemed at risk of VTE after individual assessment are started on pharmacological VTE prophylaxis. This is providing the risk of VTE outweighs the risk of bleeding (this is often a clinical judgement) and there are no contraindications. Those at very high risk may be offered anti-embolic stockings alongside the pharmacological methods. <br /><br />For surgical patients at low risk of VTE first-line treatment is anti-embolism stockings. If a patient is at high risk these stockings are used in conjunction with pharmacological prophylaxis. <br /><br /><br /><h5 class='notes-heading'>Advice for patients</h5><br />Pre-surgical interventions:<br /><ul><li><span class=\"concept\" data-cid=\"11411\">Advise women to stop taking their combined oral contraceptive pill/hormone replacement therapy 4 weeks before surgery</span></li></ul><br />Post-surgical interventions: <br /><ul><li>Try to mobilise patients as soon as possible after surgery </li><li>Ensure the patient is hydrated</li></ul><br /><br /><h5 class='notes-heading'>Post procedure prophylaxis</h5><br />For certain surgical procedures (hip and knee replacements) pharmacological VTE prophylaxis is recommended for all patients to reduce the risk of a VTE developing post-surgery. NICE make the following recommendations:<br /><br /><div class=\"table-responsive\"><table class = \"tlarge table table-striped table-bordered\"  data-role=\"table\" id=\"tableid1\" ><thead><tr><th><b>Procedure</b></th><th><b>Prophylaxis</b></th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Elective hip</td><td>LMWH for 10 days followed by aspirin (75 or 150 mg) for a further 28 days<br /><br />or<br /><br />LMWH for 28 days combined with anti-embolism stockings until discharge<br /><br />or<br /><br />Rivaroxaban</td></tr><tr><td>Elective knee</td><td>Aspirin (75 or 150 mg) for 14 days<br /><br />or<br /><br />LMWH for 14 days combined with anti-embolism stockings until discharge<br /><br />or<br /><br />Rivaroxaban</td></tr><tr><td>Fragility fractures of the pelvis, hip and proximal femur</td><td>The NICE guidance states the following (our bolding):<br /><br /><div class='bs-callout bs-callout-default'><i><br />Offer VTE prophylaxis for a <b>month</b> to people with fragility fractures of the pelvis, hip or proximal<br />femur if the risk of VTE outweighs the risk of bleeding.

            "The correct answer is <b>Diphtheria</b>. Diphtheria is a bacterial infection caused by <i>Corynebacterium diphtheriae</i> which primarily infects the throat and upper airways, leading to difficulty in breathing and swallowing. A grey coating surrounding the tonsils, fever, and cervical lymphadenopathy are classic symptoms of this disease. The patient's recent travel from India also suggests diphtheria as it is more common in countries with less access to immunisation.<br /><br /><b>Dengue fever</b> is incorrect because although it can cause fever and lymphadenopathy, it does not typically cause a grey coating on the tonsils. Dengue fever is a viral illness transmitted by mosquitoes that commonly causes high fever, severe headache, pain behind the eyes, joint pain, muscle and bone pain, rash, and mild bleeding.<br /><br />The diagnosis of <b>Typhoid</b> or <b>Paratyphoid</b>, both caused by different strains of <i>Salmonella</i>, would be unlikely in this case.

            "The correct answer is <b>Noonan syndrome</b>. Noonan syndrome is an autosomal dominant disorder characterized by a wide spectrum of symptoms and physical features, which may vary greatly in range and severity. Two key features that are often associated with this condition are pectus excavatum (a concave or 'sunken' appearance of the chest) and pulmonary stenosis (a narrowing of the pulmonary valve). Hence, the presence of both these signs in a 6-year-old boy would strongly suggest a diagnosis of Noonan syndrome.<br /><br /><b>Pierre-Robin syndrome</b> is incorrect as it is primarily characterised by micrognathia (small lower jaw), glossoptosis (downward displacement or retraction of the tongue), and cleft palate. While it can sometimes be associated with heart defects, the specific findings of pectus excavatum and pulmonary stenosis are not typical for this syndrome.<br /><br /><b>Edward's syndrome</b>, also known as Trisomy 18, is incorrect as well. This condition is generally associated with severe intellectual disability and physical abnormalities in many parts of the body. Distinctive facial features, small head and jaw, overlapping fingers, congenital heart disease, kidney problems are common but again, pectus excavatum and pulmonary stenosis are not characteristic findings.<br /><br />The option <b>William's syndrome</b> is also incorrect. William's syndrome typically presents with distinctive facial features ('elfin' face), intellectual disability or learning problems, unique personality characteristics, growth delays and cardiovascular problems, most commonly supravalvular aortic stenosis. Pectus excavatum and pulmonary stenosis do not feature prominently in its clinical presentation.<br /><br />Finally, <b>Patau syndrome</b>, or Trisomy 13, is incorrect because it causes severe physical abnormalities including microcephaly (abnormally small head), holoprosencephaly (failure of the brain to divide into lobes), cleft lip or palate, polydactyly (extra fingers or toes) among others. Congenital heart disease can occur but typically does not include pulmonary stenosis. Moreover, pectus excavatum has not been described as part of its phenotype.<br />",
