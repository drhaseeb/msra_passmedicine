        "body": "A transient ischaemic attack (TIA), as the name suggests, is a brief period of neurological deficit due to a vascular cause, typically lasting less than an hour. The National Clinical Guideline for Stroke was published in 2023 and made a number of updated recommendations, including the use of dual antiplatelet therapy (DAPT). It should be noted that DAPT is not currently recommended for 'major' ischaemic stroke as the risk of haemorrhagic transformation is too high.<br /><br />The original definition of a TIA was time-based: a sudden onset of a focal neurologic symptom and/or sign lasting less than 24 hours, brought on by a transient decrease in blood flow. However, this has now changed as it is recognised that even short periods of ischaemia can result in pathological changes to the brain. Therefore, a new '<b>tissue-based'</b> definition is now used: <span class=\"concept\" data-cid=\"9800\">a transient episode of neurologic dysfunction caused by focal brain, spinal cord, or retinal ischaemia, without acute infarction.</span> <a href='https://radiopaedia.org/articles/transient-ischaemic-attack?lang=gb#:~:text=without%20acute%20infarction.-,Terminology,-In%20the%20past' title='Radiopaedia - Transient ischaemic attack' target='_blank' class='badge rounded-pill text-bg-light deeplink'>REF</a> <br /><br />Patients often use the term 'mini-stroke' for TIAs.<br /><br /><h5 class='notes-heading'>Clinical features</h5><br />The clinical features are similar to those of a stroke, i.e. sudden onset, focal neurological deficit but, rather than persisting, the features resolve, typically within 1 hour.<br /><br />Possible features include<br /><ul><li>unilateral weakness or sensory loss.</li><li>aphasia or dysarthria</li><li>ataxia, vertigo, or loss of balance</li><li>visual problems<ul><li>sudden transient loss of vision in one eye (amaurosis fugax)</li><li>diplopia</li><li>homonymous hemianopia</li></ul></li></ul><br /><h5 class='notes-heading'>Assessment and referral</h5><br />Patients with acute focal neurological symptoms that resolve completely within 24 hours of onset (i.e. suspected TIA) should:  <br /><ul><li>be given <span class=\"concept\" data-cid=\"12219\">aspirin 300 mg</span> immediately unless contraindicated </li><li>assessed urgently within 24 hours by a stroke specialist clinician</li></ul><br />Examples of TIA mimics that require exclusion<br /><ul><li><span class=\"concept\" data-cid=\"3993\">hypoglycaemia</span></li><li>intracranial haemorrhage<ul><li>all <span class=\"concept\" data-cid=\"4061\">patients on anticoagulants or with similar risk factors should be admitted for urgent imaging to exclude haemorrhage</span></li></ul></li></ul><br />If a patient presents more than 7 days ago they should be seen by a stroke specialist clinician as soon as possible within 7 days.<br /><br />The <span class=\"concept\" data-cid=\"1684\">ABCD2 prognostic score</span> has previously been used to risk stratify patients who present with a suspected TIA.

This is usually the result of <span class=\"concept\" data-cid=\"10519\">red blood cell destruction by IgM-type antibodies</span>.<br /><br />Symptoms begin minutes after the transfusion is started and include a fever, abdominal and chest pain, agitation and hypotension.<br /> <br />Treatment should include immediate transfusion termination, <span class=\"concept\" data-cid=\"3117\">generous fluid resuscitation</span> with saline solution and informing the lab<br /><br />Complications include disseminated intravascular coagulation, and renal failure<br /><br /><br /><h5 class='notes-heading'>Non-haemolytic febrile reaction</h5><br />Febrile reactions<br /><ul><li>due to white blood cell HLA antibodies</li><li>often the result of sensitization by previous pregnancies or transfusions</li><li><span class=\"concept\" data-cid=\"5507\">paracetamol</span> may be given</li></ul><br /><br /><h5 class='notes-heading'>Allergic/anaphylaxis reaction</h5><br />Allergic reactions to blood transfusions are caused by hypersensitivity reactions to components within the transfusion. Symptoms typically arise within minutes of starting the transfusion and severity can range from urticaria to anaphylaxis with hypotension, dyspnoea, wheezing, and stridor, or angioedema. <br /><br />Simple urticaria should be treated by discontinuing the transfusion and with an <span class=\"concept\" data-cid=\"3115\">antihistamine</span>. Once the symptoms resolve, the transfusion may be continued with no need for further workup. <br /><br />More severe allergic reaction or anaphylaxis should be treated urgently. The transfusion should be permanently discontinued, <span class=\"concept\" data-cid=\"3116\">intramuscular adrenaline</span> should be administered and supportive care. Antihistamine, corticosteroids and bronchodilators should also be considered for these patients. <br /><br /><br /><h5 class='notes-heading'>Transfusion-related acute lung injury (TRALI)</h5><br />A rare but potentially fatal complication of blood transfusion. Characterised by the development of hypoxaemia / acute respiratory distress syndrome within 6 hours of transfusion. Features include:<br /><ul><li>hypoxia</li><li>pulmonary infiltrates on chest x-ray</li><li>fever</li><li><span class=\"concept\" data-cid=\"9273\">hypotension</span></li></ul><br /><br /><h5 class='notes-heading'>Transfusion-associated circulatory overload (TACO)</h5><br />A relatively common reaction due to fluid overload resulting in pulmonary oedema.

Bacterial contamination is less common but possible, particularly from skin flora during collection.</li><li>Clinical impact: Viral infections can lead to chronic disease states such as chronic hepatitis or AIDS. Bacterial infections may manifest as sepsis if not promptly treated.</li></ul><br />Platelets<br /><ul><li>Pathogens: <span class=\"concept\" data-cid=\"12212\">Platelets are stored at room temperature, which increases the risk of bacterial proliferation</span>. Common contaminants include <i>Staphylococcus epidermidis</i> and <i>Bacillus cereus</i>.</li><li>Clinical impact: Bacterial contamination of platelets is more likely to lead to rapid onset of sepsis and septic shock, given the optimal growth conditions during storage.</li></ul><br /><h6 class='notes-subheading'>Prions</h6><br />Transmission of vCJD<br /><ul><li>although the absolute risk is very small, vCJD may be transmitted via blood transfusion</li><li>a number of steps have been taken to minimise this risk, including:<ul><li>from late 1999 onward, all donations have undergone removal of white cells (leucodepletion) in order to reduce any vCJD infectivity present</li><li>from 1999, plasma derivatives have been fractionated from imported plasma rather than being sourced from UK donors. Fresh Frozen Plasma (FFP) used for children and certain groups of adults needing frequent transfusions is also imported</li><li>from 2004 onward, recipients of blood components have been excluded from donating blood</li></ul></li></ul>",

            "The correct answer is <b><i>Bacillus cereus</i></b>. This bacterium causes a type of food poisoning that can result in diarrhoea within 6-15 hours after ingestion of contaminated food, making it the pathogen with the shortest incubation period on this list. The symptoms are due to the production of enterotoxins by the bacterium, which acts directly on the cells lining the gut.<br /><br /><b><i>Salmonella</i></b> typically has an incubation period of 12-72 hours. It's a common cause of foodborne illness and can lead to diarrhoea, fever, and abdominal cramps. Salmonellosis usually resolves without treatment within 4-7 days, but severe cases may require hospitalisation.<br /><br /><b><i>Shigella</i></b>, another bacterial cause of gastroenteritis, generally has an incubation period between 1-3 days. Shigella infection or shigellosis can result in diarrhoea (often bloody), fever, and stomach cramps starting a day or two after exposure to the bacteria. Most people recover from shigellosis within a week without antibiotic treatment.<br /><br />The incubation period for <b><i>Campylobacter</i></b> is typically 2-5 days. Campylobacteriosis presents as diarrhoea (often bloody), fever, and abdominal cramps. While it's one of the most common causes of gastroenteritis worldwide, it does not have as short an incubation period as Bacillus cereus.<br /><br />Finally, <b><i>Escherichia coli</i></b>, depending on the strain involved, typically has an incubation period between 24-72 hours.
