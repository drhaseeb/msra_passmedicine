Blood tracks into the medial layer and splits the tissues with the subsequent creation of a false lumen. It most commonly occurs in the ascending aorta or just distal to the left subclavian artery (less common). It is most common in Afro-carribean males aged 50-70 years. </li><li>Patients usually present with a tearing intrascapular pain, which may be similar to the pain of a myocardial infarct. </li><li>The dissection may spread either proximally or distally with subsequent disruption to the arterial branches that are encountered. </li><li>In the Stanford classification system the disease is classified into lesions with a proximal origin (Type A) and those that commence distal to the left subclavian (Type B).</li><li>Diagnosis may be suggested by a chest x-ray showing a widened mediastinum. Confirmation of the diagnosis is usually made by use of CT angiography</li><li>Proximal (Type A) lesions are usually treated surgically, type B lesions are usually managed non operatively.</li></ul><br /><b>Pulmonary embolism</b><br /><ul><li>Typically sudden onset of chest pain, haemoptysis, hypoxia and small pleural effusions may be present. </li><li>Most patients will have an underlying deep vein thrombosis</li><li>Diagnosis may be suggested by various ECG findings including S waves in lead I, Q waves in lead III and inverted T waves in lead III. Confirmation of the diagnosis is usually made through use of CT pulmonary angiography.</li><li>Treatment is with anticoagulation, in those patients who develop a cardiac arrest or severe compromise from their PE, consideration may be given to thrombolysis.</li></ul><br /><b>Myocardial infarction</b><br /><ul><li>Traditionally described as sudden onset of central, crushing chest pain. It may radiate into the neck and down the left arm. Signs of autonomic dysfunction may be present. The presenting features may be atypical in the elderly and those with diabetes.</li><li>Diagnosis is made through identification of new and usually dynamic ECG changes (and cardiac enzyme changes). Inferior and anterior infarcts may be distinguished by the presence of specific ECG changes (usually II, III and aVF for inferior, leads V1-V5 for anterior).</li><li>Treatment is with oral antiplatelet agents, primary coronary angioplasty and/ or thrombolysis.</li></ul><br /><b>Perforated peptic ulcer</b><br /><ul><li>Patients usually develop sudden onset of epigastric abdominal pain, it may be soon followed by generalised abdominal pain.</li><li>There may be features of antecendant abdominal discomfort, the pain of gastric ulcer is typically worse immediately after eating.</li><li>Diagnosis may be made by erect chest x-ray which may show a small amount of free intra-abdominal air (very large amounts of air are more typically associated with colonic perforation).</li><li>Treatment is usually with a laparotomy, small defects may be excised and overlaid with an omental patch, larger defects are best managed with a partial gastrectomy.</li></ul><br /><b>Boerhaaves syndrome</b><br /><ul><li>Spontaneous rupture of the oesophagus that occurs as a result of repeated episodes of vomiting.</li><li>The rupture is usually distally sited and on the left side.</li><li>Patients usually give a history of sudden onset of severe chest pain that may complicate severe vomiting.</li><li>Severe sepsis occurs secondary to mediastinitis.</li><li>Diagnosis is CT contrast swallow.</li><li>Treatment is with thoracotomy and lavage, if less than 12 hours after onset then primary repair is usually feasible, surgery delayed beyond 12 hours is best managed by insertion of a T tube to create a controlled fistula between oesophagus and skin.</li><li>Delays beyond 24 hours are associated with a very high mortality rate.</li></ul>",

            "<b>Record a posterior ECG</b> is the correct answer. This patient has presented with features suggestive of myocardial infarction (MI), chest pain, dyspnoea and diaphoresis. The ECG carried out on scene shows changes that should alert the clinician to the need to perform a posterior ECG. This involves placing leads V4-V6 on that patient's back to make leads V7-V9. V7 should be placed in the left posterior axillary line, V8 at the tip of the left scapula and V9 in the left paraspinal region, all in the same horizontal plane as V4-6. ST-elevation and Q waves in these leads confirm posterior infarction and the patient should be transferred for primary percutaneous coronary intervention as soon as possible. Posterior MIs are often missed so it is important to have a high index of suspicion and a low threshold for getting a posterior ECG. Remember to hand-write on the print-out that leads V4-6 are actually V7-9. <br /><br />This patient has presented with symptoms of acute coronary syndrome (ACS). The ECG features are consistent with a posterior MI. Although ST depression can be a feature of hypokalaemia, this is not the most likely diagnosis in this case, so <b>giving IV potassium replacement</b> would be incorrect. <br /><br /><b>Give calcium gluconate IV</b> is incorrect. This is given in severe hyperkalaemia to stabilise the myocardium. ECG features of hyperkalaemia include tall tented T waves, PR prolongation and QRS widening. Symptoms include palpitations, weakness, fatigue and syncope. This presentation would be more consistent with ACS. <br /><br /><b>Giving ibuprofen and colchicine</b> would be the appropriate management for a diagnosis of pericarditis. This would typically present with chest pain that is worse on lying flat. Classical ECG changes in pericarditis would be wide-spread concave ST elevation, with PR depression and reciprocal changes in aVR and V1. The clinical picture and ECG changes in this case are more consistent with ACS. <br /><br />A <b>CT aortogram</b> is used to investigate for aortic dissection. This can present with severe chest pain, breathlessness and sweating and would be a sensible differential to rule out. The pain is classically tearing in nature, however, chest pain is not always present or can be atypical. ECG can be normal or can show ST elevation. It would be best in this scenario to record a posterior ECG to investigate for posterior MI prior to investigating for an aortic dissection due to the classic features of ACS in the history.",

            "The correct answer is <b>Symptomatic patient with random glucose 12.0 mmol/L on one occasion</b>. According to UK diagnostic criteria for diabetes mellitus, a diagnosis can be established in a patient with classic symptoms of hyperglycaemia (polyuria, polydipsia, unexplained weight loss) and a random plasma glucose \u226511.1 mmol/L. This patient has symptoms suggestive of diabetes and a random glucose of 12.0 mmol/L, which exceeds the diagnostic threshold of 11.1 mmol/L. In symptomatic patients, a single measurement above this threshold is sufficient for diagnosis without the need for a confirmatory test.<br /><br /><b>Asymptomatic patient with fasting glucose 7.9 mmol/L on one occasion</b> is incorrect. While this value is elevated (normal fasting glucose is <6.0 mmol/L), it falls into the 'impaired fasting glycaemia' category (6.1-6.9 mmol/L according to WHO criteria, or 5.6-6.9 mmol/L according to ADA criteria). For an asymptomatic patient, a fasting glucose \u22657.0 mmol/L is required for diagnosis, and this should be confirmed with a second test on another day. This patient's value of 7.9 mmol/L would warrant a repeat test, but a single measurement is insufficient for diagnosis in an asymptomatic individual.<br /><br /><b>Symptomatic patient with fasting glucose 6.8 mmol/L on two occasions</b> is incorrect. Despite having symptoms and two consistent measurements, the fasting glucose value of 6.8 mmol/L falls below the diagnostic threshold of \u22657.0 mmol/L required for diabetes diagnosis. This value falls into the 'impaired fasting glycaemia' category and would be classified as prediabetes, not diabetes mellitus. The presence of symptoms would prompt further investigation, possibly including an oral glucose tolerance test.<br /><br /><b>Glycosuria +++</b> is incorrect. While glycosuria (glucose in the urine) can suggest hyperglycaemia, it is not diagnostic of diabetes mellitus. The renal threshold for glucose reabsorption varies between individuals (typically around 10 mmol/L), and glycosuria can occur in other conditions such as pregnancy, certain medications, or renal tubular disorders. Additionally, some individuals may have a low renal threshold and exhibit glycosuria with normal blood glucose levels (renal glycosuria). Diagnosis of diabetes must be based on blood glucose measurements, not urinary findings.<br /><br /><b>Asymptomatic patient with random glucose 22.0 mmol/L on one occasion</b> is incorrect, though this requires careful explanation. While this value is significantly elevated and strongly suggestive of diabetes, UK guidelines specify that in asymptomatic individuals, a single random glucose measurement\u2014regardless of how high\u2014is insufficient for diagnosis. The correct approach would be to perform a confirmatory test, either a fasting glucose or HbA1c. However, it's worth noting that in clinical practice, such a markedly elevated value (22.0 mmol/L) would prompt immediate action and treatment might be initiated while awaiting confirmation.",

            "<b>Measure fractional exhaled nitric oxide and blood eosinophils</b> is the correct answer. According to the 2024 joint NICE/BTS/SIGN guidelines, this patient is at step 3 of the treatment pathway, receiving moderate-dose Maintenance and Reliever Therapy (MART). As her asthma is not controlled despite satisfactory adherence and technique, the next step (Step 4) is to investigate for evidence of type 2 inflammation by measuring biomarkers. These are fractional exhaled nitric oxide (FeNO) and the peripheral blood eosinophil count. The results of these tests guide subsequent management. If either the FeNO or eosinophil count is raised, this indicates underlying type 2 inflammation, and the patient should be referred to a specialist for consideration of biologic therapies. If both biomarkers are normal, a trial of add-on therapy with either a leukotriene receptor antagonist (LTRA) or a long-acting muscarinic antagonist (LAMA) can be initiated in primary care. This represents a significant shift in asthma management towards a more personalised approach, using biomarkers to stratify patients and target treatments more effectively.<br /><br /><b>Add a long-acting muscarinic antagonist</b> is incorrect. While adding a LAMA is a therapeutic option for patients with uncontrolled asthma on moderate-dose MART, it is not the initial next step. The guidelines recommend first checking FeNO and blood eosinophils. A trial of a LAMA is only recommended if these biomarkers are not raised. Proceeding directly to adding a LAMA would bypass the crucial step of phenotyping the patient's asthma, potentially delaying referral for more effective specialist treatments like biologics if type 2 inflammation is present.<br /><br /><b>Add a leukotriene receptor antagonist</b> is incorrect for similar reasons to adding a LAMA. An LTRA is a valid add-on therapy at this stage of management, but its initiation is conditional on the results of biomarker testing. The 2024 guidelines clearly state that FeNO and blood eosinophils should be checked first. If these are normal, a trial of an LTRA (or a LAMA) is then appropriate. Therefore, this is a plausible but premature action.<br /><br /><b>Increase to high-dose MART</b> is incorrect. Previously, escalating the dose of inhaled corticosteroid (ICS) was a standard step. However, the current guidelines advise against routinely escalating to high-dose ICS in primary care. The risks of systemic side effects increase significantly with high-dose ICS, and patients at this stage require specialist evaluation. The guidelines state that patients on a treatment regimen containing a high-dose ICS, or those being considered for it, should be referred to a respiratory specialist. This allows for confirmation of the diagnosis, assessment of comorbidities, and consideration of steroid-sparing advanced therapies.<br /><br /><b>Refer to a respiratory specialist</b> is incorrect at this specific point.

        "body": "In 2024 NICE, the British Thoracic Society and SIGN produced joint guidelines on the management of asthma following many years of conflicting guidelines. The new guidelines represent a major step change in the management of asthma is both diagnosed and treated.<br /><br />For many years patients with asthma were started on a short-acting beta-2 agonist (SABA) inhaler before 'stepping up' to a regular inhaled corticosteroid with a SABA as required. The new guidelines now advocate the use of combined inhalers (ICS + long-acting beta-2 agonist) as reliever therapy or regularly, depending on the severity of asthma. Given the prevalence of asthma, it is likely that doctors will have to deal with patients on 'conventional' asthma treatments for many years to come. The joint guidelines therefore include guidance on how to manage these patients if their current treatment is controlling their symptoms sufficiently.<br /><br /><h5 class='notes-heading'>Management of adult patients aged children aged \u2265 12 years with newly diagnosed asthma</h5><br />Step 1 <a href='https://www.nice.org.uk/guidance/ng245/chapter/Recommendations#pharmacological-management-in-people-aged-12-and-over:~:text=and%20over.-,Initial%20management%20of%20newly%20diagnosed%20asthma%20in%20people%20aged%2012%20and%20over,-1.7.1' title='NICE - 2024 Asthma: diagnosis, monitoring and chronic asthma management (BTS, NICE, SIGN)' target='_blank' class='badge rounded-pill text-bg-light deeplink'>NICE</a><ul><li>a <span class=\"concept\" data-cid=\"12286\">low-dose inhaled corticosteroid (ICS)/formoterol combination inhaler to be taken as needed for symptom relief</span><ul><li>this is termed anti-inflammatory reliever (AIR) therapy</li></ul></li><li>if the patient presents highly symptomatic (for example, regular nocturnal waking) or with a severe exacerbation:<ul><li><span class=\"concept\" data-cid=\"12295\">start treatment with low-dose MART</span> (maintenance and reliever therapy, see below)</li><li>treat the acute symptoms as appropriate (e.g. a course of oral corticosteroids may be indicated)</li></ul></li></ul><br />Step 2  <a href='https://www.nice.org.uk/guidance/ng245/chapter/Recommendations#pharmacological-management-in-people-aged-12-and-over:~:text=asthma%20management.-,Medicine%20combination%20and%20sequencing%20in%20people%20aged%2012%20and%20over,-For%20guidance%20on' title='NICE - 2024 Asthma: diagnosis, monitoring and chronic asthma management (BTS, NICE, SIGN)' target='_blank' class='badge rounded-pill text-bg-light deeplink'>NICE</a> <br /><ul><li><span class=\"concept\" data-cid=\"12287\">a low-dose MART</span><ul><li>MART describes using an inhaled corticosteroid (ICS)/formoterol combination inhaler for daily maintenance therapy and the relief of symptoms as needed, i.e. regularly and as required</li></ul></li></ul><br />Step 3<br /><ul><li>a <span class=\"concept\" data-cid=\"12288\">moderate-dose MART</span></li></ul><br />Step 4<br /><ul><li><span class=\"concept\" data-cid=\"12289\">check the fractional exhaled nitric oxide (FeNO) level if available, and the blood eosinophil count</span>  <a href='https://www.nice.org.uk/guidance/ng245/chapter/Recommendations#pharmacological-management-in-people-aged-12-and-over:~:text=Check%20the%20fractional%20exhaled%20nitric%20oxide%20(FeNO)%20level%20if%20available' title='NICE - 2024 Asthma: diagnosis, monitoring and chronic asthma management (BTS, NICE, SIGN)' target='_blank' class='badge rounded-pill text-bg-light deeplink'>NICE</a> <ul><li>if <span class=\"concept\" data-cid=\"12290\">either of these is raised, refer to a specialist in asthma care</span></li><li>if <span class=\"concept\" data-cid=\"12291\">neither FeNO nor eosinophil count is raised, consider a trial of either a leukotriene receptor antagonist (LTRA) or a long-acting muscarinic receptor antagonist (LAMA)</span> used in addition to moderate-dose MART</li><li>if control has not improved, stop the LTRA or LAMA and start a trial of the alternative medicine (LTRA or LAMA)</li></ul></li></ul><br />Step 5<br /><ul><li><span class=\"concept\" data-cid=\"12292\">refer people to a specialist in asthma care</span> when asthma is not controlled despite treatment with moderate-dose MART, and trials of an LTRA and a LAMA</li></ul><br /><div class=\"container\"><div class=\"row\"><div class=\"col-md-3\"><a href=\"https://d32xxyeh8kfs8k.cloudfront.net/images_Passmedicine/pdd602b.png\" data-fancybox=\"gallery\" data-caption=\"Algorithm showing pharmacological management of asthma in people aged 12 years and over\"><img  class=\"img-thumbnail mx-auto d-block\" style=\"max-height:150px;margin-bottom:10px;\" src=\"https://d32xxyeh8kfs8k.cloudfront.net/images_Passmedicine/pdd602.png\" alt=\"\" /></a></div></div></div><br /><h5 class='notes-heading'>Transferring people aged 12 and over from other treatment pathways</h5><br />There will be many people whose asthma was managed according to the previous guidelines that present with uncontrolled asthmatic symptoms.

        "body": "A cataract is a common eye condition where the lens of the eye gradually opacifies i.e. becomes cloudy. This cloudiness makes it more difficult for light to reach the back of the eye (retina), thus causing reduced/blurred vision. Cataracts are the leading cause of curable blindness worldwide.<br /><br />Epidemiology<br /><ul><li>Cataracts are more common in women than in men</li><li>The incidence of cataracts increases with age. One study found that 30% of individuals aged 65 and over had a visually-impairing cataract in either one or both eyes</li></ul>\t<br />Causes<br /><ul><li><span class=\"concept\" data-cid=\"9546\">Normal ageing process: most common cause</span></li></ul><br />Other possible causes<br /><ul><li>Smoking</li><li>Increased alcohol consumption</li><li>Trauma</li><li>Diabetes mellitus</li><li><span class=\"concept\" data-cid=\"6026\">Long-term corticosteroids</span></li><li>Radiation exposure</li><li><span class=\"concept\" data-cid=\"5143\">Myotonic dystrophy</span></li><li>Metabolic disorders: <span class=\"concept\" data-cid=\"5142\">hypocalcaemia</span></li></ul><br />Patients typically present with a gradual onset of:<br /><ul><li>Reduced vision</li><li>Faded colour vision: making it more difficult to distinguish different colours</li><li>Glare: lights appear brighter than usual</li><li>Halos around lights</li></ul><br />Signs:<br /><ul><li>A Defect in the red reflex: the red reflex is essentially the reddish-orange reflection seen through an ophthalmoscope when a light is shone on the retina. Cataracts will prevent light from getting to the retina, hence you see a defect in the red reflex.</li></ul><br />Investigations:<br /><ul><li>Ophthalmoscopy: done after pupil dilation. Findings: normal fundus and optic nerve</li><li>Slit-lamp examination. Findings: visible cataract </li></ul><br />Classification<br /><ul><li><span class=\"concept\" data-cid=\"9420\">Nuclear</span>: change lens refractive index, common in old age</li><li>Polar: localized, commonly inherited, lie in the visual axis</li><li>Subcapsular: due to <span class=\"concept\" data-cid=\"2728\">steroid</span> use, just deep to the lens capsule, in the visual axis</li><li>Dot opacities: common in normal lenses, also seen in diabetes and myotonic dystrophy</li></ul><br />Management<br /><ul><li>Non-surgical: In the early stages, age-related cataracts can be managed conservatively by prescribing stronger glasses/contact lens, or by encouraging the use of brighter lighting. These options help optimise vision but do not actually slow down the progression of cataracts, therefore surgery will eventually be needed.</li><li>Surgery: Surgery is the only effective treatment for cataracts. This involves removing the cloudy lens and replacing this with an artificial one. <span class=\"concept\" data-cid=\"9745\">NICE suggests that referral for surgery should be dependent upon whether a visual impairment is present, impact on quality of life, and patient choice</span>. Also whether both eyes are affected and the possible risks and benefits of surgery should be taken into account.  Prior to cataract surgery, patients should be provided with information on the refractive implications of various types of intraocular lenses. After cataract surgery, patients should be advised on the use of eye drops and eyewear, what to do if vision changes and the management of other ocular problems. Cataract surgery has a high success rate with 85-90% of patients achieving 6/12 corrected vision (on a Snellen chart) postoperatively. </li></ul>\t<br />Complications following surgery<br /><ul><li><span class=\"concept\" data-cid=\"4075\">Posterior capsule opacification</span>: thickening of the lens capsule</li><li>Retinal detachment</li><li>Posterior capsule rupture</li><li><span class=\"concept\" data-cid=\"10758\">Endophthalmitis</span>: inflammation of aqueous and/or vitreous humour</li></ul><br /><CENTER><table><tr><td align = 'left' colspan='2'><a data-fancybox class='fancybox' rel='group' href='https://d32xxyeh8kfs8k.cloudfront.net/images_Passmedicine/pdd136b.jpg'><img class='ajaximage' src='https://d32xxyeh8kfs8k.cloudfront.net/images_Passmedicine/pdd136.jpg'/></a></td></tr><tr><td valign='top' align='left'></td><td align='right'><a data-fancybox class='fancybox lbmagglasslink' rel='group' href='https://d32xxyeh8kfs8k.cloudfront.net/images_Passmedicine/pdd136b.jpg'><img src='https://d32xxyeh8kfs8k.cloudfront.net/css/images/mag_glass.png'/></a></td></tr></table></CENTER><div class='imagetext'>A hypermature age-related cortico-nuclear cataract with a brunescent (brown) nucleus.

Xanthelasma is often associated with hypercholesterolaemia, a condition characterised by high levels of cholesterol in the blood. Hypercholesterolaemia can lead to atherosclerosis and subsequently cardiovascular diseases. <br /><br /><b>Hypertriglyceridaemia</b> is an incorrect option. While it is true that hypertriglyceridaemia can also cause xanthoma (fatty deposits under the skin), these usually present as eruptive xanthomas (small red-yellow bumps) or tuberous xanthomas (larger nodules), rather than xanthelasma.<br /><br /><b>Hypothyroidism</b>, another incorrect option, can sometimes be associated with hypercholesterolaemia due to decreased metabolism of lipids. However, hypothyroidism itself would not directly cause xanthelasma. Hypothyroidism presents with symptoms such as fatigue, weight gain, cold intolerance, constipation, and dry skin.<br /><br />The diagnosis of <b>Wilson's disease</b> does not fit the given scenario either.
