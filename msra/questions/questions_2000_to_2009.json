            "The correct answer is <b>Pelvic floor muscle training</b>. The patient's symptoms of leaking urine when she coughs or laughs are indicative of stress urinary incontinence, which is usually caused by weakening of the pelvic floor muscles. Pelvic floor muscle training (PFMT) is recommended as first-line treatment for this condition according to NICE guidelines. This involves exercises to strengthen the muscles that support the bladder and prevent leakage.<br /><br /><b>Bladder retraining</b> would not be the most appropriate initial management in this case. Bladder retraining can be helpful for patients with urgency or mixed urinary incontinence, where there is a component of overactive bladder syndrome. However, it would not address the underlying issue of weakened pelvic floor muscles in stress urinary incontinence.<br /><br /><b>Topical oestrogen cream</b> can be used in postmenopausal women if they have symptomatic urogenital atrophy, which can contribute to both urgency and stress urinary incontinence. However, it should not be used as first-line treatment for stress urinary incontinence alone.<br /><br /><b>Regular toileting</b>, also known as scheduled voiding or timed voiding, may help manage symptoms but it does not treat the underlying cause of stress urinary incontinence. This strategy might be more useful for patients with functional incontinence who have difficulty reaching a toilet due to physical limitations.<br /><br />A <b>Trial of oxybutynin</b> would not be suitable here either. Oxybutynin is an antimuscarinic medication used primarily to treat overactive bladder syndrome which presents with urgency, frequency and nocturia. It's less effective for stress urinary incontinence which is due to physical changes such as weakened pelvic floor muscles rather than overactivity of the detrusor muscle.",

        "body": "Degenerative cervical myelopathy (DCM) has a number of risk factors, which include smoking due to its effects on the intervertebral discs, genetics and occupation - those exposing patients to high axial loading [1]. <br /><br />The presentation of DCM is very variable. Early symptoms are often subtle and can vary in severity day to day, making the disease difficult to detect initially. However as a progressive condition, worsening, deteriorating or new symptoms should be a warning sign.<br /><br />DCM symptoms can include any combination of [1]: <br /><ul><li>Pain (affecting the neck, upper or lower limbs)</li><li>Loss of motor function (loss of digital dexterity, preventing simple tasks such as holding a fork or doing up their shirt buttons, arm or leg weakness/stiffness leading to impaired gait and imbalance</li><li>Loss of sensory function causing numbness</li><li>Loss of autonomic function (urinary or faecal incontinence and/or impotence) - these can occur and do not necessarily suggest cauda equina syndrome in the absence of other hallmarks of that condition</li><li>Hoffman's sign: is a reflex test to assess for cervical myelopathy. It is performed by gently flicking one finger on a patient's hand. A positive test results in reflex twitching of the other fingers on the same hand in response to the flick. </li></ul><br />The most common symptoms at presentation of DCM are unknown, but in one series 50% of patients were initially incorrectly diagnosed and sometimes treated for carpal tunnel syndrome [2].<br /><br />An MRI of the cervical spine is the gold standard test where cervical myelopathy is suspected. It may reveal disc degeneration and ligament hypertrophy, with accompanying cord signal change.<br /><br />All patients with degenerative cervical myelopathy should be urgently referred for assessment by specialist spinal services (neurosurgery or orthopaedic spinal surgery). This is due to the importance of early treatment. The timing of surgery is important, as any existing spinal cord damage can be permanent. Early treatment (within 6 months of diagnosis) offers the best chance of a full recovery but at present, most patients are presenting too late. In one study, patients averaged over 5 appointments before diagnosis, representing >2 years. <br /><br />Currently, decompressive surgery is the only effective treatment. It has been shown to prevent disease progression. Close observation is an option for mild stable disease, but anything progressive or more severe requires surgery to prevent further deterioration. Physiotherapy should only be initiated by specialist services, as manipulation can cause more spinal cord damage. <br /><br />References<br />1. Baron EM, Young WF.

            "<b>Ascending cholangitis</b> is the correct answer. This patient presents with the classic Charcot's triad of right upper quadrant pain, fever, and jaundice, which is pathognomonic for ascending cholangitis, though it only occurs in 20-50% of cases. Ascending cholangitis is a bacterial infection of the biliary tree, most commonly caused by <i>E. coli</i>, and typically occurs secondary to biliary obstruction, with gallstones being the most common predisposing factor. The patient's history of gallstones, combined with fever (38.8\u00b0C), RUQ pain, jaundice (yellowing of sclera), and raised inflammatory markers with deranged liver function tests, strongly supports this diagnosis. Fever is the most common feature, present in 90% of cases, followed by RUQ pain (70%) and jaundice (60%). The raised inflammatory markers reflect the systemic infection, whilst the deranged liver function tests indicate biliary obstruction and cholestasis. This is a medical emergency requiring prompt treatment with intravenous antibiotics and endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP) within 24-48 hours to relieve the obstruction and prevent progression to septic shock and multi-organ failure. If the patient also developed hypotension and confusion, this would constitute Reynolds' pentad, indicating severe disease with a poorer prognosis.<br /><br /><b>Acute cholecystitis</b> is inflammation of the gallbladder, typically caused by obstruction of the cystic duct by a gallstone. Whilst this patient has a history of gallstones and presents with RUQ pain and fever, the presence of jaundice makes acute cholecystitis less likely. Jaundice is uncommon in uncomplicated acute cholecystitis and, when present, suggests either Mirizzi syndrome (where external compression of the common hepatic duct occurs from an impacted gallstone in the cystic duct) or progression to ascending cholangitis. Patients with acute cholecystitis typically present with RUQ pain that may radiate to the right shoulder, fever, and Murphy's sign (inspiratory arrest on palpation of the RUQ). The inflammatory markers would be raised, but liver function tests are usually normal unless there is associated biliary obstruction. The combination of all three features of Charcot's triad in this patient makes ascending cholangitis the more likely diagnosis.<br /><br /><b>Choledocholithiasis</b> refers to the presence of stones in the common bile duct. Whilst this is likely the underlying cause of this patient's ascending cholangitis, choledocholithiasis alone does not fully explain the clinical presentation. Choledocholithiasis can be asymptomatic or may cause biliary colic, obstructive jaundice, and deranged liver function tests with a cholestatic picture. However, the presence of fever and raised inflammatory markers indicates infection (cholangitis) rather than simple obstruction. Choledocholithiasis is a predisposing factor for ascending cholangitis, occurring when bacteria ascend from the duodenum into the obstructed biliary system. In this case, the stone in the common bile duct has led to stasis and subsequent bacterial infection. Therefore, whilst choledocholithiasis is part of the pathophysiology, the complete clinical picture with fever and systemic upset indicates that infection has supervened, making ascending cholangitis the most accurate diagnosis.<br /><br /><b>Acute pancreatitis</b> typically presents with severe epigastric pain radiating to the back, vomiting, and raised serum amylase or lipase levels. Whilst gallstones are a common cause of acute pancreatitis (accounting for approximately 50% of cases in the UK), and this patient does have a history of gallstones, the clinical presentation does not fit well with pancreatitis. The pain is described as right upper quadrant rather than epigastric, and there is prominent jaundice with deranged liver function tests, which would be unusual in uncomplicated pancreatitis unless there is associated biliary obstruction. Jaundice in pancreatitis typically occurs due to oedema of the pancreatic head causing compression of the common bile duct, but this would not explain the fever and raised inflammatory markers to the same degree. The presence of Charcot's triad strongly points towards a biliary infection rather than pancreatic inflammation.<br /><br /><b>Primary biliary cholangitis</b> is a chronic autoimmune condition causing progressive destruction of the small intrahepatic bile ducts, leading to cholestasis and eventually cirrhosis. It predominantly affects middle-aged women and typically presents insidiously with fatigue, pruritus, and gradually progressive jaundice over months to years. Patients may have associated autoimmune conditions and positive anti-mitochondrial antibodies (AMA) in over 95% of cases.

        "question": "A 72-year-old woman presents to the emergency department with a 2-day history of right upper quadrant pain, fever, and yellowing of her sclera. She has a past medical history of gallstones. On examination, she appears unwell with a temperature of 38.8\u00b0C and tenderness in the right upper quadrant. Blood tests show raised inflammatory markers and deranged liver function tests.<br /><br />What is the most likely diagnosis?",
        "correct_answer": "1",
        "question_notes": "<b>Ascending cholangitis</b> is the correct answer. This patient presents with the classic Charcot's triad of right upper quadrant pain, fever, and jaundice, which is pathognomonic for ascending cholangitis, though it only occurs in 20-50% of cases. Ascending cholangitis is a bacterial infection of the biliary tree, most commonly caused by <i>E. coli</i>, and typically occurs secondary to biliary obstruction, with gallstones being the most common predisposing factor. The patient's history of gallstones, combined with fever (38.8\u00b0C), RUQ pain, jaundice (yellowing of sclera), and raised inflammatory markers with deranged liver function tests, strongly supports this diagnosis. Fever is the most common feature, present in 90% of cases, followed by RUQ pain (70%) and jaundice (60%). The raised inflammatory markers reflect the systemic infection, whilst the deranged liver function tests indicate biliary obstruction and cholestasis. This is a medical emergency requiring prompt treatment with intravenous antibiotics and endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP) within 24-48 hours to relieve the obstruction and prevent progression to septic shock and multi-organ failure. If the patient also developed hypotension and confusion, this would constitute Reynolds' pentad, indicating severe disease with a poorer prognosis.<br /><br /><b>Acute cholecystitis</b> is inflammation of the gallbladder, typically caused by obstruction of the cystic duct by a gallstone. Whilst this patient has a history of gallstones and presents with RUQ pain and fever, the presence of jaundice makes acute cholecystitis less likely. Jaundice is uncommon in uncomplicated acute cholecystitis and, when present, suggests either Mirizzi syndrome (where external compression of the common hepatic duct occurs from an impacted gallstone in the cystic duct) or progression to ascending cholangitis. Patients with acute cholecystitis typically present with RUQ pain that may radiate to the right shoulder, fever, and Murphy's sign (inspiratory arrest on palpation of the RUQ). The inflammatory markers would be raised, but liver function tests are usually normal unless there is associated biliary obstruction. The combination of all three features of Charcot's triad in this patient makes ascending cholangitis the more likely diagnosis.<br /><br /><b>Choledocholithiasis</b> refers to the presence of stones in the common bile duct. Whilst this is likely the underlying cause of this patient's ascending cholangitis, choledocholithiasis alone does not fully explain the clinical presentation. Choledocholithiasis can be asymptomatic or may cause biliary colic, obstructive jaundice, and deranged liver function tests with a cholestatic picture. However, the presence of fever and raised inflammatory markers indicates infection (cholangitis) rather than simple obstruction. Choledocholithiasis is a predisposing factor for ascending cholangitis, occurring when bacteria ascend from the duodenum into the obstructed biliary system. In this case, the stone in the common bile duct has led to stasis and subsequent bacterial infection. Therefore, whilst choledocholithiasis is part of the pathophysiology, the complete clinical picture with fever and systemic upset indicates that infection has supervened, making ascending cholangitis the most accurate diagnosis.<br /><br /><b>Acute pancreatitis</b> typically presents with severe epigastric pain radiating to the back, vomiting, and raised serum amylase or lipase levels. Whilst gallstones are a common cause of acute pancreatitis (accounting for approximately 50% of cases in the UK), and this patient does have a history of gallstones, the clinical presentation does not fit well with pancreatitis. The pain is described as right upper quadrant rather than epigastric, and there is prominent jaundice with deranged liver function tests, which would be unusual in uncomplicated pancreatitis unless there is associated biliary obstruction. Jaundice in pancreatitis typically occurs due to oedema of the pancreatic head causing compression of the common bile duct, but this would not explain the fever and raised inflammatory markers to the same degree. The presence of Charcot's triad strongly points towards a biliary infection rather than pancreatic inflammation.<br /><br /><b>Primary biliary cholangitis</b> is a chronic autoimmune condition causing progressive destruction of the small intrahepatic bile ducts, leading to cholestasis and eventually cirrhosis. It predominantly affects middle-aged women and typically presents insidiously with fatigue, pruritus, and gradually progressive jaundice over months to years. Patients may have associated autoimmune conditions and positive anti-mitochondrial antibodies (AMA) in over 95% of cases. The acute presentation in this patient with fever, RUQ pain over 2 days, and raised inflammatory markers is completely inconsistent with primary biliary cholangitis, which does not cause acute infection or fever. Whilst liver function tests would show a cholestatic pattern in both conditions, the acute onset, fever, and history of gallstones make an acute infectious/obstructive process far more likely than a chronic autoimmune condition. Primary biliary cholangitis would not explain the acute clinical deterioration or the presence of fever and systemic inflammatory response.",
