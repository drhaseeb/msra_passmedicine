            "The most likely diagnosis for this patient is <b>Seasonal affective disorder</b>. This condition is characterized by recurrent episodes of depression that typically occur during the same season each year, often in winter. The patient's presentation with depressive symptoms during two consecutive winters supports this diagnosis.<br /><br /><b>Cyclothymic disorder</b> is a less likely diagnosis because it involves alternating periods of hypomanic symptoms and depressive symptoms that do not meet the criteria for major depressive episodes. This patient does not report any hypomanic or manic symptoms, making cyclothymic disorder less likely.<br /><br /><b>Atypical depression</b> can be distinguished from other types of depression by its specific symptom profile, including mood reactivity (mood brightens in response to positive events), increased appetite or weight gain, hypersomnia, leaden paralysis (heavy feeling in arms or legs), and a long-standing pattern of sensitivity to interpersonal rejection. The patient's presentation does not include these specific features, making atypical depression an unlikely diagnosis.<br /><br />Although the patient has a history of cannabis use, <b>Schizophrenia</b> is an unlikely diagnosis in this case. Schizophrenia is characterized by positive symptoms such as hallucinations and delusions, negative symptoms like social withdrawal and flattened affect, and disorganized thinking or behaviour. The patient's presentation does not include any of these features; he only presents with depressive symptoms.<br /><br />Finally, <b>Drug-induced depression</b> could potentially be considered due to the patient's cannabis use. However, his depressive episodes have occurred specifically during winter months over multiple years rather than being consistently associated with cannabis use. Additionally, drug-induced depression would typically resolve after discontinuing the causative substance.

        "body": "Seasonal affective disorder (SAD) describes depression which occurs predominately around the winter months. SAD should be treated the same way as depression, therefore as per the NICE guidelines for mild depression, you would begin with psychological therapies and follow up with the patient in 2 weeks to ensure that there has been no deterioration. Following this an SSRI can be given if needed. In seasonal affective disorder, you should not give the patient sleeping tablets as this can make the symptoms worse. Finally, the evidence for light therapy is limited and as such it is not routinely recommended.",

NICE recommend that all decisions about thrombectomy take into account a patient's overall clinical status:<br /><ul><li>NICE recommend a pre-stroke functional status of less than 3 on the modified Rankin scale and a score of more than 5 on the National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale (NIHSS)</li></ul><br />Offer thrombectomy as soon as possible and within <span class=\"concept\" data-cid=\"9594\">6 hours of symptom onset</span>, together <span class=\"concept\" data-cid=\"9596\">with intravenous thrombolysis (if within 4.5 hours)</span>, to people who have:<br />acute ischaemic stroke and<br /><ul><li>confirmed occlusion of the <b>proximal anterior circulation</b> demonstrated by computed tomographic angiography (CTA) or magnetic resonance angiography (MRA) </li></ul><br />Offer thrombectomy as soon as possible to people who were last known to be well between <span class=\"concept\" data-cid=\"9595\">6 hours and 24 hours previously (including wake-up strokes)</span>:<br /><ul><li>confirmed occlusion of the <b>proximal anterior circulation</b> demonstrated by CTA or MRA and</li><li>if there is the <span class=\"concept\" data-cid=\"9595\">potential to salvage brain tissue, as shown by imaging such as CT perfusion or diffusion-weighted MRI sequences showing limited infarct core volume</span></li></ul><br /><i>Consider</i> thrombectomy together with intravenous thrombolysis (if within 4.5 hours) as soon as possible for people last known to be well up to 24 hours previously (including wake-up strokes):<br /><ul><li>who have acute ischaemic stroke and confirmed occlusion of the <b>proximal posterior circulation (that is, basilar or posterior cerebral artery)</b> demonstrated by CTA or MRA and</li><li>if there is the potential to salvage brain tissue, as shown by imaging such as CT perfusion or diffusion-weighted MRI sequences showing limited infarct core volume</li></ul><br /><br /><h5 class='notes-heading'>Secondary prevention</h5><br />Recommendations from NICE include:<br /><ul><li><span class=\"concept\" data-cid=\"10231\">clopidogrel is now recommended</span> by NICE ahead of combination use of aspirin plus modified-release (MR) dipyridamole in people who have had an ischaemic stroke</li><li><span class=\"concept\" data-cid=\"10232\">aspirin is recommended after an ischaemic stroke only if clopidogrel is contraindicated or not tolerated</span></li></ul><br /><span class=\"concept\" data-cid=\"4059\">Carotid endarterectomy</span> is recommend if the patient has suffered a stroke or TIA in the carotid territory and is not severely disabled<br /><ul><li>should only be considered if the stenosis > 50% according to North American Symptomatic Carotid Endarterectomy Trial (NASCET) criteria</li></ul>  - it should be noted that previous guidelines have used other reporting methods, that have resulted in different cut-offs, e.g. European Carotid Surgery Trial (ECST) with a cut-off of 70%<br /><ul><li>it should be performed as soon as possible within 7 days</li></ul>",

            "<b>Levonorgestrel-releasing intrauterine system</b> is the most appropriate option for this patient. It is a highly effective long-acting reversible contraceptive (LARC), which meets the patient's primary request. Crucially, it addresses both her medical history and her gynaecological symptoms. As it contains only progestogen, which acts locally with minimal systemic absorption, it is a safe method of contraception for women with controlled hypertension (UK Medical Eligibility Criteria for Contraceptive Use [UKMEC] category 2). Furthermore, the local release of levonorgestrel within the uterine cavity causes endometrial atrophy. This makes it a first-line treatment for heavy menstrual bleeding (menorrhagia), as recommended by NICE guideline NG88. Many users experience a significant reduction in blood loss, with a substantial proportion becoming amenorrhoeic. This dual therapeutic benefit for both contraception and menorrhagia, combined with its safety in hypertension, makes it the ideal choice.<br /><br /><b>Combined oral contraceptive pill</b> is contraindicated in this patient. The combined pill contains synthetic oestrogen, which is associated with an increased risk of arterial and venous thromboembolic events. A history of hypertension is a significant risk factor for cardiovascular disease, and the addition of oestrogen would further elevate her risk of stroke and myocardial infarction. According to UKMEC guidelines, the use of combined hormonal contraception in a woman with adequately controlled hypertension is a category 3, meaning the theoretical or proven risks usually outweigh the advantages. Therefore, it is not a safe or appropriate choice.<br /><br /><b>Copper intrauterine device</b> is not the most appropriate choice. While the copper IUD is a highly effective, non-hormonal LARC and is perfectly safe for women with hypertension (UKMEC 1), it is known to have an adverse effect on menstrual bleeding. A common side effect is an increase in the volume and duration of menstrual bleeding, as well as an increase in dysmenorrhoea. Given this patient is already presenting with heavy periods, inserting a copper IUD would be very likely to worsen her symptoms, negatively impacting her quality of life. Therefore, despite being a safe LARC, it is clinically inappropriate for her specific circumstances.<br /><br /><b>Progestogen-only pill</b> is a possible but less suitable option. The progestogen-only pill (POP) is safe for women with hypertension (UKMEC 1 or 2). However, it fails to meet the patient's request for a 'long-acting' method, as it requires strict daily compliance to maintain contraceptive efficacy. While the POP can sometimes lead to amenorrhoea, its effect on bleeding patterns is unpredictable and it is not licensed or recommended as a primary treatment for menorrhagia. The levonorgestrel-releasing intrauterine system is far more effective at managing heavy menstrual bleeding and offers the convenience and reliability of a LARC method.<br /><br /><b>Contraceptive injection</b> is a less optimal choice. The depot medroxyprogesterone acetate (DMPA) injection is a LARC that is safe in women with hypertension (UKMEC 2). It is effective and often induces amenorrhoea, which would be beneficial for her heavy periods. However, the IUS is generally considered a superior first-line option. The contraceptive injection is associated with a potential for a delayed return to fertility after cessation and, with long-term use, a small, reversible reduction in bone mineral density. The IUS provides a longer duration of action (up to 8 years for some types) without these specific concerns.",
