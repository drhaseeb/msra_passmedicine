            "The correct answer to this question is <b>Acne rosacea</b>. This condition, also known as rosacea, is a common skin disease that often begins with a tendency to blush or flush more easily than other people. The redness can slowly spread beyond the nose and cheeks to the forehead and chin. Even the ears, chest, and back can be red all the time. The image shows typical features of Acne rosacea: erythema (redness) of the cheeks with some papules (small bumps) and pustules. It's important to note that this condition is different from acne, which typically includes blackheads and whiteheads - these are not present in rosacea.<br /><br /><b>Seborrhoeic dermatitis</b> is an incorrect option because it usually presents with greasy-looking, flaky skin in areas rich in sebaceous glands such as the scalp, eyebrows, sides of the nose, behind the ears and middle of the chest. It does not typically present with spots on cheeks.<br /><br /><b>Systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE)</b> could potentially cause a malar rash ('butterfly' rash) on cheeks but this would usually also involve the bridge of the nose which isn't mentioned in this case. Additionally, SLE-related rashes are photosensitive and there was no mention of sunlight exacerbating symptoms in this scenario.<br /><br /><b>Perioral dermatitis</b>, as its name suggests, tends to occur around the mouth area (although sometimes it can affect areas around the eyes or nose). It presents as groups of itchy or tender small red papules. It's unlikely in this case due to the location being described as 'cheeks'.<br /><br />Lastly, <b>Late-onset acne vulgaris</b>, while possible at any age including adulthood ('late-onset'), would typically include comedones (blackheads & whiteheads), which were not mentioned here. Furthermore, over-the-counter treatments like Clearasil often have some effect on acne vulgaris but none on rosacea according to the patient's history.<br />",

This patient's presentation is consistent with seborrhoeic dermatitis, characterised by erythematous, scaly patches in sebum-rich areas such as the face (particularly nasolabial folds, eyebrows) and upper chest. The condition is associated with the presence of <i>Malassezia</i> species (formerly known as <i>Pityrosporum</i>), and the patient's history of dandruff (seborrhoeic dermatitis of the scalp) supports this diagnosis. Topical ketoconazole is an antifungal agent that is effective against <i>Malassezia</i> and is a first-line treatment for seborrhoeic dermatitis according to UK guidelines.<br /><br /><b>Topical metronidazole</b> is incorrect as this is primarily used for rosacea, which typically presents with facial flushing, persistent erythema, and papules/pustules, but without the scaling characteristic of seborrhoeic dermatitis.<br /><br /><b>Oral oxytetracycline</b> is incorrect as this antibiotic is typically used for conditions such as acne or rosacea. While it can help with inflammatory skin conditions, it is not indicated for seborrhoeic dermatitis, which requires antifungal treatment.<br /><br /><b>Oral isotretinoin</b> is incorrect as this is a powerful retinoid reserved for severe, resistant nodular acne. It has significant side effects and requires careful monitoring. It would be inappropriate for seborrhoeic dermatitis.<br /><br /><b>Topical hydrocortisone</b> is incorrect as monotherapy. While topical corticosteroids can temporarily improve the appearance of seborrhoeic dermatitis, they do not address the underlying cause and long-term use can lead to skin atrophy and other complications.

            "The correct answer is <b><i>Bacillus cereus</i></b>. This gram-positive, spore-forming bacterium is commonly associated with food poisoning from improperly stored and reheated rice dishes. The organism produces two types of toxins: an emetic toxin that causes vomiting (predominant symptom occurring 1-5 hours after ingestion) and a diarrhoeal toxin. The spores can survive cooking and, if rice is left at room temperature, they can germinate, multiply and produce toxins. Reheating does not destroy these pre-formed toxins.<br /><br /><b><i>Escherichia coli</i></b> typically causes food poisoning through contaminated meat products or unwashed vegetables. The incubation period is usually longer (12-72 hours), and diarrhoea is the predominant symptom rather than vomiting. While it can cause severe illness, it would be less likely in this scenario involving reheated rice.<br /><br /><b><i>Campylobacter</i></b> is commonly associated with undercooked poultry, unpasteurised milk, and contaminated water. It typically has a longer incubation period (2-5 days) and presents with diarrhoea, often bloody, along with severe abdominal pain and fever. The presentation and food history in this case do not fit with Campylobacter infection.<br /><br /><b><i>Salmonella</i></b> infection typically occurs through contaminated eggs, poultry, or dairy products. The incubation period is usually 12-72 hours, and symptoms include diarrhoea, fever, and abdominal cramps. The rapid onset of predominantly vomiting symptoms and the association with reheated rice makes Salmonella less likely.<br /><br /><b><i>Shigella</i></b> is transmitted through the faecal-oral route and is commonly associated with poor hygiene rather than reheated food. It typically causes dysentery with bloody diarrhoea, fever, and abdominal pain, with an incubation period of 1-7 days. The clinical presentation and food history make this an unlikely causative organism in this case.",

            "The correct answer is <b>Hyperthermia</b>. Cocaine use can lead to an increase in body temperature, or hyperthermia. This occurs as a result of increased metabolic activity and muscle rigidity, both of which are stimulated by cocaine's action on the central nervous system. Hyperthermia may also be exacerbated by the environmental conditions often associated with cocaine use, such as crowded and hot environments.<br /><br /><b>Hypokalaemia</b> is not typically associated with cocaine use. Hypokalaemia refers to low levels of potassium in the blood. While it is true that stimulant drugs can cause a shift of potassium into cells and thereby reduce serum levels, this effect is generally minimal and would not typically result in clinically significant hypokalaemia.<br /><br /><b>Decreased deep tendon reflexes</b>, although potentially indicative of certain neurological or muscular disorders, are not commonly seen in association with acute cocaine intoxication. Cocaine primarily affects the central nervous system causing increased sympathetic outflow leading to symptoms such as tachycardia, hypertension, mydriasis (dilated pupils), and psychomotor agitation.<br /><br />Contrary to causing <b>Hypotension</b>, cocaine usually leads to hypertension due to its sympathomimetic effects. It inhibits the reuptake of norepinephrine at nerve endings leading to vasoconstriction and therefore an increase in blood pressure.<br /><br />Finally, while acute cocaine intoxication can indeed alter acid-base balance due to respiratory alkalosis from hyperventilation or metabolic acidosis from seizures or rhabdomyolysis, <b>Metabolic alkalosis</b> is unlikely because there's no mechanism by which cocaine would lead directly to a loss of hydrogen ions or gain in bicarbonate ions - the primary causes of metabolic alkalosis.<br />",
