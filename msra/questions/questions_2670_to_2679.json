        "body": "Patient with diabetes mellitus have traditionally had their blood pressure controlled more aggressively to help reduce their overall cardiovascular risk. However, a 2013 Cochrane review cast doubt on the wisdom of lower blood pressure targets for patients with diabetes. It compared patients who had tight blood pressure control (targets < 130/85 mmHg) with more relaxed control (< 140-160/90-100 mmHg). Patients who were more tightly controlled had a slightly reduced rate of stroke but otherwise, outcomes were not significantly different.<br /><br />In light of this, NICE recommends a <span class=\"concept\" data-cid=\"604\">blood pressure target of < 140/90 mmHg for type 2 diabetics</span>, the same as for patients without diabetes.<br /><br />For patients with type 1 diabetes, NICE recommends:<br /><br /><div class='bs-callout bs-callout-default'><i><br />Intervention levels for recommending blood pressure management should be <span class=\"concept\" data-cid=\"10779\">135/85 mmHg</span> unless the adult with type 1 diabetes has albuminuria or 2 or more features of metabolic syndrome, in which case it should be 130/80 mmHg<br /></i></div><br />Because <span class=\"concept\" data-cid=\"603\">ACE inhibitors/or angiotensin-II receptor antagonist (A2RBs)</span> have a renoprotective effect in diabetes they are the first-line antihypertensive regardless of age. A2RBs are preferred for black African or African-Caribbean diabetic patients. Further management then reverts to that of non-diabetic patients.<br /><br />Remember that autonomic neuropathy may result in more postural symptoms in patients taking antihypertensive therapy.<br /><br />The routine use of beta-blockers in uncomplicated hypertension should be avoided, particularly when given in combination with thiazides, as they may cause insulin resistance, impair insulin secretion and alter the autonomic response to hypoglycaemia.",

            "The correct answer is 'Sudden onset of visual loss' as optic neuritis typically presents with subacute visual loss developing over hours to days, rather than a sudden onset. The inflammation of the optic nerve characteristically causes a progressive deterioration of vision over a short period.<br /><br /><b>Eye pain worse on movement</b> is a classic feature of optic neuritis, occurring in approximately 90% of cases. The pain typically precedes or accompanies visual loss and is exacerbated by eye movements due to inflammation of the optic nerve and its surrounding tissues stretching during movement.<br /><br /><b>Relative afferent pupillary defect (RAPD)</b> is a characteristic finding in unilateral or asymmetric optic neuritis. When the affected eye is illuminated, there is a reduced pupillary constriction compared to illumination of the unaffected eye, demonstrating impaired transmission of light signals through the affected optic nerve.<br /><br /><b>Poor discrimination of colours, 'red desaturation'</b> is a typical early manifestation of optic neuritis. Patients often report that colours, particularly red, appear washed out or less vibrant in the affected eye compared to the normal eye. This occurs due to inflammation affecting the optic nerve fibres that carry colour vision information.<br /><br /><b>Central scotoma</b> is a classic finding in optic neuritis where patients experience a central visual field defect. This occurs because the papillomacular bundle, which serves central vision, is preferentially affected by the inflammatory process. The central scotoma may be absolute or relative and is typically demonstrated on visual field testing.<br /><br />These features form part of the typical presentation of optic neuritis, which is often associated with demyelinating conditions such as multiple sclerosis. The condition most commonly affects young adults, particularly females, and usually shows improvement within weeks to months, either spontaneously or with corticosteroid treatment.",

NICE guidelines also have a section on the management of osteoporosis, largely based on the NOGG guidelines. Remember that osteporosis is usually asymptomatic until a fracture occurs. When thinking about osteoporosis management it is useful to think about a number of potential clinical scenarios:<br /><ul><li>a patient who has been identified as being at high risk of a fragility fracture based on a QFracture or FRAX score (please see the textbook entry on 'Osteoporosis: assessing risk')</li><li>a patient who is about to start treatment that puts them at significant risk of developing osteoporosis - the most common example is longer-term glucocorticoids</li><li>a patient who has just had a fragility fracture e.g. a symptomatic osteoporotic vertebral fracture</li></ul><br /><h5 class='notes-heading'>General management points</h5><br />General points about the management of all patients<br /><ul><li>all patients who are at risk of osteoporosis or have osteoporosis should be given advice regarding:<ul><li>lifestyle changes: a healthy, balanced diet, moderation of alcohol consumption and avoidance of smoking</li><li>a sufficient dietary calcium and vitamin D intake:  supplementation should be offered to all women unless the clinician is confident they have adequate calcium intake and are vitamin D replete</li><li>encourage a combination of regular weight-bearing and muscle strengthening exercise</li></ul></li><li>secondary causes of osteoporosis should be considered and treated<ul><li>e.g. hypogonadism in women or men e.g. hormone replacement therapy for premature menopause</li></ul></li><li>bisphosphonates are the first-line drug treatment for patients at risk of fragility fractures<ul><li>oral bisphosphonates such as alendronate and risedronate are typically first-line.

            "This question is about antibiotic prescribing in chronic kidney disease (CKD). Many drugs need dose adjustment in renal disease due to changes in drug metabolism and also pharmacokinetics. Often this dose adjustment is made on the level of the estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) which is a calculated surrogate of renal function using the serum creatinine. Stages of chronic kidney disease are classified according to the eGFR; stage 3 CKD equates to an eGFR of 30-59ml/min.<br /><br />Nitrofurantoin is a relatively old and unique antibiotic which has enjoyed a new lease of life with increasing antibiotic resistance. It is actually an inactive pro-drug which is reduced in vivo to active forms by the bacterial flavoprotein nitrofuran reductase, and it is these reduced forms of the drug which  exert their antibiotic properties by damaging bacterial proteins. In order to be effective at treating urinary tract infections, nitrofurantoin needs to be concentrated in the urine and an adequate glomerular filtration is required for this to occur. An eGFR of less than 40-60ml/min means that the drug is wholly ineffective as a bactericidal agent and is not recommended in patients with CKD stage 3 or worse due to the likelihood of treatment failure. Coupled with this is the risk of drug toxicity in the patient. Without adequate renal filtration, the drug is likely to accumulate. Although bacterial flavoproteins activate nitrofurantoin more readily, human enzymes can reduce this drug to generate many highly active radical species, which can cause side effects including peripheral neuropathy, which may not be reversible, hepatotoxicity and acute and chronic pulmonary reactions and fibrosis.<br /><br />Patients taking nitrofurantoin should be advised that this drug will discolour the urine. It is also a safe drug to use in pregnancy except at full term when there is a risk of haemolysis in the neonate.<br /><br />Amoxicillin and co-amoxiclav are widely used antibiotics in the treatment of urinary tract infections and are relatively safe in renal impairment. Dose reduction is recommended in severe chronic renal disease, i.e. an eGFR <15-30ml/min to avoid the risk of crystalluria. Similarly, a reduction in dose is necessary for ciprofloxacin in CKD to avoid crystalluria although this is recommended from an eGFR of 30-60ml/min.<br /><br />Trimethoprim is an antibiotic which is entirely safe to use in all but the most severe forms of chronic kidney disease where a modest dose adjustment is required. It should be noted however that use of trimethoprim is likely to affect the results of renal function tests since the drug inhibits tubular secretion of creatinine leading to a rise in serum levels in all patients, including those with previously normal renal function. This is without any effect on the glomerular filtration rate. ",
