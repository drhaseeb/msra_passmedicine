Nephrogenic DI results from renal insensitivity to anti-diuretic hormone (ADH), preventing the concentration of urine. Causes of nephrogenic DI are numerous, including CKD, nephrotoxic drugs and metabolic disturbances. This lack of ADH sensitivity results in an inability to concentrate urine even if a patient is hypovolaemic, therefore producing a low urine osmolality even during water deprivation. Furthermore, as the kidneys are insensitive to ADH, they will not respond to desmopressin (synthetic ADH) and urine osmolality will once again be low. <br /><br />High urine osmolality after both fluid deprivation and desmopressin is incorrect as this would be seen in a healthy individual or primary polydipsia.<br /><br />Low urine osmolality after desmopressin, but high after fluid deprivation is incorrect as this would not be commonly seen with any pathological state. <br /><br />Low urine osmolality after fluid deprivation, but high after desmopressin is incorrect as this is typically seen with cranial DI.

            "<b>Perform combined HIV p24 antigen and antibody test now</b> is the correct answer. Current UK guidelines recommend combination tests (HIV p24 antigen and HIV antibody) as the standard for HIV diagnosis and screening. At 3 weeks post-exposure, this patient is within the window where p24 antigen may be detectable (typically positive from 1 week to 3-4 weeks after infection), even if antibodies have not yet developed. The combined test maximises the chance of early detection. While testing in asymptomatic patients should ideally be done at 4 weeks after possible exposure for optimal sensitivity, this patient is requesting immediate testing at 3 weeks, which is reasonable timing. The combined test should be performed now, and if negative, repeated at 12 weeks to definitively exclude infection. If positive, it should be repeated to confirm the diagnosis.<br /><br /><b>Perform HIV antibody test now</b> is suboptimal because antibody-only testing has been superseded by combination testing in the UK. Most people develop HIV antibodies at 4-6 weeks, so at 3 weeks post-exposure, antibodies may not yet be present despite active infection. This approach would miss the opportunity to detect p24 antigen, which appears earlier in infection.<br /><br /><b>Perform HIV RNA viral load test now</b> is not the standard first-line screening test. While HIV RNA testing can detect infection very early (within 1-2 weeks), it is more expensive, not routinely used for initial screening, and may be reserved for specific circumstances such as suspected acute seroconversion illness or for monitoring known HIV infection.<br /><br /><b>Arrange HIV antibody test at 6 weeks post-exposure</b> delays testing unnecessarily and uses an inferior test. Current guidelines recommend testing at 4 weeks for asymptomatic patients, not 6 weeks. Additionally, antibody-only testing is no longer the standard approach when combination tests are available.<br /><br /><b>Arrange combined HIV p24 antigen and antibody test at 4 weeks post-exposure</b> would delay testing by one week when the patient is already at 3 weeks and requesting immediate testing. While 4 weeks is the recommended timing for asymptomatic patients, testing at 3 weeks with the combined test is reasonable and provides earlier reassurance or diagnosis, with the understanding that a negative result requires repeat testing at 12 weeks.",

            "The correct answer is <b>Lichen planus</b>. This condition is characterised by pruritic, polygonal, violaceous papules and plaques which often affect the flexor surfaces of the forearms. The description provided in the question fits this clinical picture perfectly. Lichen planus can also affect other parts of the body such as oral mucosa, genitals, scalp and nails.<br /><br /><b>Scabies</b>, on the other hand, typically present with intense pruritus that is worse at night. The lesions are usually small vesicles or papules, especially between fingers and toes, around the waist and in genital areas. While scabies can cause a rash on various parts of the body, it does not typically present with polygonal and violaceous papules.<br /><br />The third option, <b>Lichen sclerosus</b>, predominantly affects post-menopausal women although it can occur in men and children too. It primarily involves anogenital region but extragenital lesions can occur. The typical presentation is with white shiny patches on the skin that may become thin and wrinkled. Itching is common but not always present.<br /><br /><b>Morphea</b>, also known as localized scleroderma, causes patches of hard, discoloured skin that may be oval-shaped or linear. These patches initially appear reddish or purplish before becoming whitish or yellowish in the centre due to sclerosis (hardening). Morphea does not typically present as itchy violaceous papules.<br /><br />Finally, <b>Psoriasis</b> is a chronic inflammatory skin disorder that commonly presents with well-defined erythematous plaques covered by silvery scales which are most often located on extensor surfaces like elbows and knees rather than flexural aspects. Psoriasis also has a variety of presentations such as guttate psoriasis or pustular psoriasis which do not match this case scenario.<br /><br />In conclusion, based on clinical features described in the question stem; lichen planus is the most likely diagnosis considering its characteristic presentation with pruritic polygonal violaceous papules and plaques affecting flexor surfaces.<br />",
