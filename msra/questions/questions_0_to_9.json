The correct management is to advise the patient to monitor for symptoms (such as rash, flu-like symptoms, arthralgias and neurological symptoms) and seek medical advice if they develop.

His Glasgow coma score fell from 14/15 on admission to 11/15 and he is additionally agitated suggesting progression of his intracranial pathology. His ICP has now also risen to 18 mmHg whereas it was normal on admission (<15 mmHg). The rise in ICP is likely due to swelling of the brain following the head injury or enlargement of a haematoma. The consequence is that cerebral perfusion pressure (CPP) falls and results in hypoperfusion and hypoxia of normal brain tissue and this is the actual cause of his neurological deterioration. CPP is measured as the difference between the mean arterial pressure and the ICP. Therefore the body's natural response to a reduction in CPP is to try and increase the mean arterial pressure to improve the CPP and hence the patient becomes hypertensive.",
