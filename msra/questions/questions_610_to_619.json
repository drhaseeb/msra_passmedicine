            "<b>Emergency fasciotomy</b> is the correct answer. This patient presents with classical features of acute compartment syndrome following a tibial shaft fracture: excessive use of breakthrough analgesia despite regular medication, tense compartment, and severe pain on passive stretch (ankle dorsiflexion stretches the deep posterior compartment muscles). The presence of pedal pulses does not exclude compartment syndrome, as arterial flow may persist whilst microvascular perfusion is compromised. Compartment syndrome is a surgical emergency requiring prompt fasciotomy to prevent irreversible muscle and nerve damage, which can occur within 4-6 hours. The clinical diagnosis is clear in this case, and any delay for investigations would risk permanent disability. Extensive fasciotomies of all affected compartments must be performed urgently, with subsequent aggressive IV fluid therapy to prevent myoglobinuria-induced renal failure.<br /><br /><b>Increase regular analgesia</b> is incorrect and potentially dangerous. Whilst adequate analgesia is important, excessive breakthrough analgesia requirements should raise suspicion for compartment syndrome rather than prompting increased opioid administration. Masking the pain with more analgesia would delay diagnosis and definitive treatment, leading to irreversible tissue necrosis. The pain in compartment syndrome is characteristically severe and disproportionate to the injury, particularly on passive muscle stretching, and will not respond adequately to standard analgesia. This clinical scenario demands immediate surgical intervention rather than escalation of pain relief.<br /><br /><b>Intracompartmental pressure measurement</b> is incorrect in this clinical context. Whilst pressure measurement can confirm compartment syndrome (pressures >40mmHg are diagnostic), it should not delay treatment when clinical features are diagnostic. This patient has clear clinical signs: excessive analgesia requirements, tense compartment, and pain on passive stretch following a high-risk fracture. Intracompartmental pressure measurement may be useful in equivocal cases or in unconscious patients who cannot report symptoms, but proceeding directly to fasciotomy is appropriate when clinical suspicion is high. Time is critical, and unnecessary investigations risk permanent complications.<br /><br /><b>CT angiography of lower limb</b> is incorrect. The presence of palpable pedal pulses indicates arterial patency, and vascular imaging would not alter management in suspected compartment syndrome. Compartment syndrome results from microvascular compromise due to raised tissue pressure within closed fascial compartments, not from major arterial injury. CT angiography would cause significant delay to definitive treatment and is not indicated in this scenario. The diagnosis is clinical, and immediate fasciotomy is required regardless of arterial imaging findings.<br /><br /><b>Elevation of the affected limb</b> is incorrect and potentially harmful in compartment syndrome. Whilst limb elevation is appropriate for managing oedema in many orthopaedic injuries, it may worsen compartment syndrome by reducing arterial perfusion pressure to an already compromised compartment. The limb should be kept at heart level to optimise perfusion. This patient requires urgent surgical decompression rather than conservative measures. Elevation alone will not address the underlying pathophysiology of raised intracompartmental pressure and would delay appropriate treatment.",

            "The correct answer is that <b>it is a diagnosis of exclusion</b>. The patient's presentation, with persistent white patches on the inside of his mouth and a significant smoking history, raises concerns for leukoplakia.

It is important to exclude other conditions such as lichen planus and squamous cell carcinoma through biopsy, as was done in this case.<br /><br />Now let's discuss the incorrect options:<br /><br /><b>All patients should be prescribed multivitamin tablets</b>: While vitamin deficiencies can lead to oral lesions (e.g., angular cheilitis due to B-vitamin deficiency), there is no specific recommendation for prescribing multivitamin tablets for all patients with leukoplakia. Management typically focuses on addressing potential causes or risk factors (e.g., smoking cessation).<br /><br /><b>It is more common in diabetics</b>: Although there may be an increased risk of oral infections such as candidiasis in diabetics, there is no clear evidence suggesting that leukoplakia itself is more common among diabetic patients.<br /><br /><b>Topical steroids are the first-line treatment</b>: Topical steroids might be used as part of the management plan for some oral inflammatory conditions like lichen planus but are not considered first-line treatment for leukoplakia. Instead, addressing potential underlying causes or risk factors (e.g., smoking cessation) would be more appropriate.<br /><br /><b>Malignant transformation occurs in less than 1 in 10,000 patients</b>: This statement significantly underestimates the risk of malignant transformation associated with leukoplakia. The actual rate varies depending on factors such as lesion size and histopathologic features, but it has been reported that up to 20% of cases may progress to squamous cell carcinoma.

It is important to exclude other conditions such as lichen planus and squamous cell carcinoma through biopsy, as was done in this case.<br /><br />Now let's discuss the incorrect options:<br /><br /><b>All patients should be prescribed multivitamin tablets</b>: While vitamin deficiencies can lead to oral lesions (e.g., angular cheilitis due to B-vitamin deficiency), there is no specific recommendation for prescribing multivitamin tablets for all patients with leukoplakia. Management typically focuses on addressing potential causes or risk factors (e.g., smoking cessation).<br /><br /><b>It is more common in diabetics</b>: Although there may be an increased risk of oral infections such as candidiasis in diabetics, there is no clear evidence suggesting that leukoplakia itself is more common among diabetic patients.<br /><br /><b>Topical steroids are the first-line treatment</b>: Topical steroids might be used as part of the management plan for some oral inflammatory conditions like lichen planus but are not considered first-line treatment for leukoplakia. Instead, addressing potential underlying causes or risk factors (e.g., smoking cessation) would be more appropriate.<br /><br /><b>Malignant transformation occurs in less than 1 in 10,000 patients</b>: This statement significantly underestimates the risk of malignant transformation associated with leukoplakia. The actual rate varies depending on factors such as lesion size and histopathologic features, but it has been reported that up to 20% of cases may progress to squamous cell carcinoma. Therefore, regular follow-up and monitoring are essential for patients with leukoplakia.",

Haloperidol is particularly effective in treating the hallucinations and agitation associated with terminal delirium, and its oral formulation is preferred when the patient can take medications by mouth. The medication has a good safety profile and can be administered in small doses initially (0.5-1.5mg), which can be titrated according to response.<br /><br /><b>Subcutaneous midazolam</b> would not be the most appropriate first choice as it is primarily used for severe agitation when oral medications have failed or are not possible. While it can be effective in settling acute agitation, it does not specifically target the psychotic symptoms and can cause excessive sedation.

It has a narrow therapeutic window and requires regular monitoring of blood levels, making it unsuitable for palliative care patients.<br /><br /><b>Oral diazepam</b> is not the most appropriate choice as benzodiazepines can worsen confusion in elderly patients and those with delirium. While it may help with agitation, it does not address the underlying psychotic symptoms and carries risks of falls and respiratory depression.<br /><br /><b>Oral quetiapine</b>, while an effective antipsychotic, is not typically recommended as first-line treatment for terminal delirium in palliative care.
