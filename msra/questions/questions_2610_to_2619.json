            "The most appropriate screening tool to detect postnatal depression in this case is the <b>Edinburgh Scale</b>. The Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale (EPDS) is specifically designed to assess postnatal depression in women who have recently given birth. It is a 10-item self-report questionnaire that has been validated for use in the postpartum period and is widely used in primary care settings. The EPDS can help identify women at risk of developing postnatal depression, allowing for early intervention and support.<br /><br />The <b>Hamilton Depression Rating Scale</b> is a clinician-rated scale that measures the severity of depressive symptoms. Although it can be used to assess depression in various populations, it is not specific to the postpartum period and may not accurately capture the unique aspects of postnatal depression.<br /><br />The <b>Patient Health Questionnaire-2</b> (PHQ-2) is a brief screening tool that consists of only two questions, focusing on depressed mood and anhedonia. While it can be useful as an initial assessment for depression, it lacks specificity for postnatal depression and does not provide a comprehensive evaluation of symptoms.<br /><br />The <b>Beck Depression Inventory</b> (BDI) is another self-report questionnaire that evaluates depressive symptoms across various domains. However, like the Hamilton Depression Rating Scale, it is not tailored specifically to assess postnatal depression and may not be as sensitive or accurate as the EPDS in detecting this condition.<br /><br />Lastly, the <b>Patient Health Questionnaire-9</b> (PHQ-9) is a widely used self-report measure for assessing depressive symptoms but, again, it lacks specificity for postnatal depression. Although it can be helpful in identifying general depressive symptoms, it might not capture all relevant aspects of postnatal depression experienced by new mothers.",

            "The correct answer is '<b>The onset of menopausal symptoms and elevated gonadotrophin levels before the age of 40 years</b>'. Premature ovarian failure, also known as premature ovarian insufficiency, is defined by the presence of menopausal symptoms along with elevated gonadotrophin levels (FSH > 25 IU/L on two occasions more than 4 weeks apart) in women under the age of 40. This condition results from a decrease in the number or quality of follicles in the ovaries, leading to anovulation and low estrogen levels.<br /><br />The option '<b>The onset of menopausal symptoms and elevated gonadotrophin levels before the age of 42 years</b>' is incorrect because it incorrectly defines the age cut-off for premature ovarian failure. The UK guidelines clearly state that this condition occurs before the age of 40.<br /><br />Similarly, '<b>The onset of menopausal symptoms and elevated gonadotrophin levels before the age of 43 years</b>' is also incorrect for the same reason. The definition does not change based on individual patients' ages or their specific circumstances.<br /><br />'<b>The onset of menopausal symptoms and elevated gonadotrophin levels before the age of 45 years</b>' is another incorrect option. While it's true that experiencing menopause before this age is considered early, it does not meet the criteria for premature ovarian failure according to UK guidelines.<br /><br />Finally, '<b>The onset of menopausal symptoms and elevated gonadotrophin levels before the age of 48 years</b>' is incorrect as well. Menopause occurring at this age would be within normal range, as most women reach natural menopause between ages 45-55. It wouldn't be classified as either early or premature.<br />",

            "The correct answer is <b>sleeping in the same bed as the baby</b> (co-sleeping). Co-sleeping is one of the most significant modifiable risk factors for SIDS according to current evidence. The risk is particularly high if either parent smokes, has consumed alcohol, taken drugs or medications that cause drowsiness, or if the baby was born prematurely or had low birth weight. The Lullaby Trust and NICE guidelines strongly advise against bed-sharing, recommending instead that the safest place for a baby to sleep is in their own cot or Moses basket in the same room as their parents for the first six months.<br /><br /><b>Using a dummy (pacifier)</b> is incorrect because evidence actually suggests that dummy use may have a protective effect against SIDS, although the mechanism isn't fully understood. The current advice is that if a dummy is being used, it shouldn't be stopped suddenly in the first six months.<br /><br /><b>The room being too cold</b> is incorrect because while temperature regulation is important, overheating poses a greater risk than a cool room. The recommended room temperature is 16-20\u00b0C, with appropriate bedding to maintain comfort.<br /><br /><b>Not waking the baby for feeds during the night</b> is incorrect. While regular feeding is important for growth and development, there is no evidence that waking a baby for feeds reduces SIDS risk. By six weeks, most healthy term babies can be allowed to wake naturally for feeds.<br /><br /><b>Bottle feeding</b> is incorrect. While breastfeeding is associated with a lower risk of SIDS and has many other health benefits, the difference in SIDS risk between breast and bottle feeding is not as significant as the risk posed by co-sleeping.
