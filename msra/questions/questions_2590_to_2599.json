She also reports feeling rather bloated. She has never experienced this before. The GP notes some abdominal tenderness on examination and requests an upper GI endoscopy. Her current medications are aspirin, metformin and omeprazole. What advice should the GP provide her with regarding the procedure?",
        "correct_answer": "1",
        "question_notes": "As this patient is having an upper GI endoscopy, she should stop her omeprazole, a proton pump inhibitor, two weeks before her procedure. The reason for this is so that the pathology can be identified during the procedure.",
