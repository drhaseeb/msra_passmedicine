            "<b>IV ceftriaxone</b> is the correct answer. This 5-year-old child presents with clinical features highly suggestive of bacterial meningitis (fever, headache, photophobia, and drowsiness). According to UK guidelines, for children over 3 months of age, the initial empirical antibiotic treatment for suspected bacterial meningitis is a third-generation cephalosporin, either cefotaxime or ceftriaxone. These agents provide excellent coverage against the most common causative organisms in this age group: Streptococcus pneumoniae, Neisseria meningitidis, and Haemophilus influenzae type b. The CT scan has excluded raised intracranial pressure, making lumbar puncture safe to perform, but antibiotics should not be delayed whilst awaiting this investigation. Third-generation cephalosporins have excellent CSF penetration and bactericidal activity against the likely pathogens, making them the gold standard empirical choice in this age group.<br /><br /><b>IV amoxicillin and cefotaxime</b> is the recommended regimen for infants under 3 months of age, not for this 5-year-old child. In neonates and young infants, the spectrum of likely pathogens is different and includes Group B Streptococcus, Listeria monocytogenes, and Gram-negative organisms. Amoxicillin is added specifically to cover Listeria, which is not adequately covered by cephalosporins alone. However, Listeria is not a significant pathogen in immunocompetent children over 3 months of age, making this combination unnecessarily broad for this patient.<br /><br /><b>IV benzylpenicillin</b> alone would provide inadequate empirical coverage for bacterial meningitis in this age group. Whilst benzylpenicillin has good activity against meningococcus and some strains of pneumococcus, it does not reliably cover penicillin-resistant Streptococcus pneumoniae, which has become increasingly prevalent. Benzylpenicillin may be appropriate in the pre-hospital setting when meningococcal disease is strongly suspected, but once in hospital, broader spectrum coverage with a third-generation cephalosporin is required for empirical treatment.<br /><br /><b>IV vancomycin and ceftriaxone</b> represents a broader spectrum regimen that might be considered in specific circumstances, such as recent neurosurgery, CSF shunt infection, or in areas with very high rates of highly penicillin-resistant pneumococcus. Vancomycin is added to cover resistant Gram-positive organisms. However, this is not the standard first-line empirical treatment in the UK for community-acquired bacterial meningitis in an otherwise healthy child, and would represent over-treatment in this scenario without specific risk factors.<br /><br /><b>IV meropenem</b> is a carbapenem antibiotic with very broad spectrum activity, but it is not the recommended first-line empirical treatment for community-acquired bacterial meningitis in children. Meropenem would be reserved for specific situations such as healthcare-associated meningitis, post-neurosurgical infections, or when there is documented resistance to standard agents. Using such broad-spectrum antibiotics unnecessarily contributes to antimicrobial resistance and is not in line with antimicrobial stewardship principles.",

        "body": "We know that type 2 diabetes mellitus is more common in people of Asian ethnicity and a significant proportion of those patients in the UK will be Muslim. The BMJ published an excellent and comprehensive review of this issue in 2010<sup>1</sup>.<br /><br />It is important that we can give appropriate advice to Muslim patients to allow them safely observe their fast. This is particularly important from 2014 as Ramadan is due to fall in the long days of the summer months for several years henceforth. <br /><br />Clearly it is a personal decision whether a patient decides to fast. It may however be worthwhile exploring the fact that people with chronic conditions are exempt from fasting or may be able to delay fasting to the shorter days of the winter months. It is however known that many Muslim patients with diabetes do not class themselves as having a chronic/serious condition which should exempt them from fasting. Around <span class=\"concept\" data-cid=\"551\">79%</span> of Muslim patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus fast Ramadan<sup>2</sup>.There is an excellent patient information leaflet from Diabetes UK and the Muslim Council of Britain which explores these options in more detail.<br /><br />If a patient with type 2 diabetes mellitus does decide to fast:<br /><ul><li>they should try and and eat a meal containing long-acting carbohydrates prior to sunrise (Suhoor)</li><li>patients should be given a blood glucose monitor to allow them to check their glucose levels, particularly if they feel unwell</li><li>for patients taking metformin the expert consensus is that the dose should be split <span class=\"concept\" data-cid=\"550\">one-third before sunrise</span> (Suhoor) and <span class=\"concept\" data-cid=\"550\">two-thirds after sunset</span> (Iftar)</li><li>expert consensus also recommends switching once-daily sulfonylureas to after sunset. For patients taking twice-daily preparations such as gliclazide it is recommended that a larger proportion of the dose is taken after after sunset</li><li>no adjustment is needed for patients taking pioglitazone</li></ul><br />1.

            "The correct answer is <b>Relapsing-remitting disease</b>. This form of multiple sclerosis (MS) is the most common, affecting approximately 85% of people with MS at onset. It is characterised by periods of neurological symptoms (relapses) followed by periods of recovery (remissions). The relapses are due to acute inflammation in the nervous system, while remissions occur when the inflammation subsides.<br /><br /><b>Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis</b>, also known as Lou Gehrig's disease, is incorrect because it is not a type of multiple sclerosis. ALS is a separate neurodegenerative disorder that primarily affects motor neurons leading to progressive muscle weakness and atrophy.<br /><br /><b>Secondary progressive disease</b> is another type of MS but it's not the most common one. It typically follows relapsing-remitting MS, with about half of those initially diagnosed with relapsing-remitting MS developing secondary progressive MS within a decade. Unlike relapsing-remitting MS, this form does not have periods of remission and instead sees a steady progression of disability.<br /><br /><b>Progressive-relapsing disease</b> is an incorrect option as well. This rare form of MS begins with a steady progression of symptoms from the outset but also includes occasional relapses like in relapsing-remitting MS. However, it only accounts for around 5% of all cases.<br /><br />Finally, <b>Primary progressive disease</b> is also not the correct answer. This type represents about 10-15% of all cases and involves a steady worsening of neurologic functioning without any distinct relapses or remissions.",

            "The image shows an x-ray of the forearm of a child that has suffered a green-stick fracture (so named for its similarity to bending and breaking a green branch of a tree). The development of the carpal bones give away the age of the child (here the triquetrum and lunate have started developing which happens in 3- to 4-year-olds). Management involves appropriate consideration of safeguarding and usually immobilisation with a cast as green-stick tend to be quite stable as fractures.<br /><br /><b>Green-stick fracture</b> is the correct answer. It is strongly recommended to research the above types of fractures for a better understanding of their x-ray presentation. A green-stick fracture involves an incomplete fracture usually at the shaft of a long bone (as seen here in the radius and ulna). It is caused by a bending-type mechanism of injury. As with all fractures in children, it is important to consider safeguarding issues, especially with mechanisms of injury as such.<br /><br /><b>Buckle fracture</b> is incorrect. This type of fracture is usually caused by a compression force. This would create a 'buckle' as if the bone was 'shortened'. This is can be very commonly missed due to the subtle deformity it causes. It usually causes buckling of one side but if the compression is strong enough it can cause more severe deformity.<br /><br /><b>Complete transverse fracture</b> is incorrect. As the name suggests this type of fracture would involve a 'transverse', almost like a horizontal line cutting through the shaft, and 'complete', meaning that the fracture line went through the shaft from one side to the other. This is commonly seen in direct-impact trauma (e.g. playing sports in children).<br /><br /><b>Salter Harris fracture</b> is incorrect. This is a type of fracture that involves the epiphyseal plate in children. This child still has its radius and ulna epiphyseal plates growing so it would be a candidate for it. However, the abnormality is found in the shaft of the bones and not in the epiphyseal plates. There are classically 5 types that can be remembered with the mnemonic SALTER with each letter corresponding to a type:<br /><ul><li>S: straight across the epiphyseal plate (type I).</li><li>A: above the plate (type II).</li><li>L: lower than the plate (type III).</li><li>T: transversing the plate (type IV).</li><li>ER: erasing the plate (type V).</li></ul><br /><b>Toddler's fracture</b> is incorrect. This is a common fracture in the children population and it involves the tibia. It is a spiral fracture of the shaft of the tibia with an intact fibula. This is unlikely in this case the forearm is being shown on the x-ray. This type of fracture is notorious for raising safeguarding issues due to the nature of its mechanism of injury, meaning that it can potentially be caused by forceful twisting of the leg by someone.
