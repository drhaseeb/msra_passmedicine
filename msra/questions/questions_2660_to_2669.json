            "The correct answer is a <b>36-year-old woman smoking 20 cigarettes/day</b>. Combined oral contraceptive pills (COCPs) are contraindicated in women over 35 years old who smoke more than 15 cigarettes per day due to the significantly increased risk of cardiovascular events, such as myocardial infarction and stroke. This risk increases with age and the number of cigarettes smoked daily.<br /><br />Discussing the incorrect options:<br /><br /><b>Controlled hypertension</b> is not an absolute contraindication for COCP use. According to UK guidelines, if a woman's blood pressure is well controlled and monitored regularly, she may still be prescribed COCPs. However, it's important to note that COCPs can potentially increase blood pressure, so regular monitoring is necessary.<br /><br />A <b>history of cholestasis</b>, particularly pregnancy-related cholestasis, may increase the risk of this condition recurring with COCP use. While caution should be exercised when prescribing COCPs to women with this history, it is not considered an absolute contraindication.<br /><br />A <b>BMI of 38 kg/m^2</b> is associated with increased risks when using COCPs due to the higher likelihood of venous thromboembolism (VTE). However, obesity alone doesn't constitute an absolute contraindication for COCP use according to UK guidelines. The overall clinical picture including co-morbidities and lifestyle factors should be taken into account when assessing suitability for these contraceptives.<br /><br />Finally, having a <b>migraine without aura</b> does not necessarily preclude a woman from using COCPs. While migraines with aura are considered an absolute contraindication due to the elevated stroke risk associated with both conditions, migraines without aura are generally not seen as carrying the same level of risk. Therefore, under careful consideration and regular review, a woman suffering from migraines without aura could still potentially use combined oral contraceptives.<br />",

            "Mechanical valves are still commonly used in younger patients as they have a longer lifespan than tissue valves. However, they require life-long anticoagulation to prevent thrombosis around the valve. The only licensed and therefore most appropriate agent is warfarin for long-term anticoagulation. The INR target for aortic mechanical valves is usually 3.0 (aiming within 2.5 - 3.5).<br /><br />Apixaban is a direct oral anticoagulant (DOAC) that inhibits factor Xa, preventing the conversion of prothrombin to thrombin in the common pathway of blood clotting. It is commonly used for most indications in which anticoagulation is required including pulmonary embolism (PE) and preventing stroke in atrial fibrillation (AF). It is not licensed for mechanical valves at present as the anticoagulant effect cannot be titrated as it can with warfarin.<br /><br />Dabigatran is another DOAC that directly inhibits thrombin, preventing the formation of fibrin in the common pathway of blood clotting. Dabigatran is also used in thromboprophylaxis in AF and to treat PE but is not licensed for mechanical valves and is a poor choice.<br /><br />Dalteparin is low-molecular-weight heparin and is given parenterally, usually through a subcutaneous injection. Although it can be used in most anticoagulation scenarios, including mechanical valves, it is a poor choice for long-term anticoagulation as it is given as an injection and this man will need to use it life-long.<br /><br />Fondaparinux is a synthetic pentasaccharide that acts with antithrombin to directly inhibit factor Xa. It can be used in the treatment of PE, acute myocardial infarction and thromboprophylaxis after surgery. However, it is not licensed for mechanical valves and must be given as a subcutaneous injection so it is a poor choice.",

        "title": "Degenerative cervical myelopathy",
        "body": "Degenerative cervical myelopathy (DCM) has a number of risk factors, which include smoking due to its effects on the intervertebral discs, genetics and occupation - those exposing patients to high axial loading [1]. <br /><br />The presentation of DCM is very variable. Early symptoms are often subtle and can vary in severity day to day, making the disease difficult to detect initially. However as a progressive condition, worsening, deteriorating or new symptoms should be a warning sign.<br /><br />DCM symptoms can include any combination of [1]: <br /><ul><li>Pain (affecting the neck, upper or lower limbs)</li><li>Loss of motor function (loss of digital dexterity, preventing simple tasks such as holding a fork or doing up their shirt buttons, arm or leg weakness/stiffness leading to impaired gait and imbalance</li><li>Loss of sensory function causing numbness</li><li>Loss of autonomic function (urinary or faecal incontinence and/or impotence) - these can occur and do not necessarily suggest cauda equina syndrome in the absence of other hallmarks of that condition</li><li>Hoffman's sign: is a reflex test to assess for cervical myelopathy. It is performed by gently flicking one finger on a patient's hand. A positive test results in reflex twitching of the other fingers on the same hand in response to the flick. </li></ul><br />The most common symptoms at presentation of DCM are unknown, but in one series 50% of patients were initially incorrectly diagnosed and sometimes treated for carpal tunnel syndrome [2].<br /><br />An MRI of the cervical spine is the gold standard test where cervical myelopathy is suspected. It may reveal disc degeneration and ligament hypertrophy, with accompanying cord signal change.<br /><br />All patients with degenerative cervical myelopathy should be urgently referred for assessment by specialist spinal services (neurosurgery or orthopaedic spinal surgery). This is due to the importance of early treatment. The timing of surgery is important, as any existing spinal cord damage can be permanent. Early treatment (within 6 months of diagnosis) offers the best chance of a full recovery but at present, most patients are presenting too late. In one study, patients averaged over 5 appointments before diagnosis, representing >2 years. <br /><br />Currently, decompressive surgery is the only effective treatment. It has been shown to prevent disease progression. Close observation is an option for mild stable disease, but anything progressive or more severe requires surgery to prevent further deterioration. Physiotherapy should only be initiated by specialist services, as manipulation can cause more spinal cord damage. <br /><br />References<br />1. Baron EM, Young WF.

The loss of adhesion leads to intraepidermal blister formation.<br /><br /><b>Pemphigoid</b> is another autoimmune blistering disorder, but it differs from pemphigus vulgaris in that it involves the formation of tense blisters rather than flaccid ones. In pemphigoid, autoantibodies target components of the basement membrane zone, leading to subepidermal blister formation. Due to the deeper location of these blisters compared to those seen in pemphigus vulgaris, they are more resistant to rupture.<br /><br /><b>Dermatitis herpetiformis</b> is a chronic autoimmune skin condition associated with gluten sensitivity and coeliac disease. It presents as intensely pruritic papules, vesicles, and excoriations typically distributed symmetrically on extensor surfaces such as elbows, knees, and buttocks.
