            "The correct answer is <b>No oxygen therapy</b>. According to UK guidelines, oxygen should only be administered to patients with suspected acute myocardial infarction if they are hypoxaemic (SpO2 <94%). In this case, the patient has oxygen saturations of 97% on room air, which is within the normal range. Unnecessary oxygen administration in normoxaemic patients with acute myocardial infarction may be harmful as it can increase coronary vascular resistance and reduce coronary blood flow.<br /><br /><b>2-4 l/min via nasal cannulae</b> would be inappropriate as the patient is not hypoxaemic.

        "title": "Acute coronary syndrome: initial management",
        "body": "Acute coronary syndrome (ACS) is a very common and important presentation in medicine. The management of ACS has evolved over recent years, with the development of new drugs and procedures such as percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI).<br /><br />Emergency departments often have their own protocols based on local factors such as the availability of PCI and hospital drug formularies. The following is based on the 2020 update to the NICE ACS guidelines.<br /><br />Acute coronary syndrome can be classified as follows:<br /><ul><li>ST-elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI): ST-segment elevation + elevated biomarkers of myocardial damage</li><li>non ST-elevation myocardial infarction (NSTEMI): ECG changes but no ST-segment elevation + elevated biomarkers of myocardial damage</li><li>unstable angina</li></ul><br />The management of ACS depends on the particular subtype. NICE management guidance groups the patients into two groups:<br /><ul><li>1. STEMI</li><li>2. NSTEM/unstable angina</li></ul><br /><h5 class='notes-heading'>Common management of all patients with ACS</h5><br />Initial drug therapy<br /><ul><li><span class=\"concept\" data-cid=\"11121\">aspirin 300mg</span></li><li><span class=\"concept\" data-cid=\"11122\">oxygen should only be given if the patient has oxygen saturations < 94%</span> in keeping with British Thoracic Society oxygen therapy guidelines</li><li><span class=\"concept\" data-cid=\"11123\">morphine should only be given for patients with severe pain</span><ul><li>previously IV morphine was given routinely</li><li>evidence, however, suggests that this may be associated with adverse outcomes </li></ul></li><li>nitrates<ul><li>can be given either sublingually or intravenously</li><li>useful if the patient has ongoing chest pain or hypertension</li><li><span class=\"concept\" data-cid=\"11124\">should be used in caution if patient hypotensive</span></li></ul></li></ul><br />The next step in managing a patient with suspected ACS is to determine whether they meet the ECG criteria for STEMI.

            "The correct answer is <b>Symptoms triggered by sudden change in head position</b>. Meniere's disease, a disorder of the inner ear, commonly results in symptoms such as vertigo, tinnitus, aural fullness and sensorineural hearing loss. However, symptoms being triggered by sudden changes in head position is not a typical feature of Meniere's disease but rather suggestive of benign paroxysmal positional vertigo (BPPV). BPPV is characterised by brief episodes of mild to intense dizziness associated with specific changes in the position of the head.<br /><br />Discussing each incorrect answer:<br /><br /><b>Aural fullness</b> is indeed recognised in patients with Meniere's disease. This symptom refers to a sense of pressure or fullness in the ears which can be quite uncomfortable for patients. It is thought to be due to an increase in endolymphatic fluid within the labyrinthine compartments of the inner ear.<br /><br /><b>Sensorineural hearing loss</b> is another recognised symptom of Meniere's disease. This type of hearing loss occurs due to damage to the hair cells in the cochlea or along the auditory pathway from the cochlea to the brain. In Meniere's disease, sensorineural hearing loss typically starts at low frequencies and progressively involves higher frequencies.<br /><br /><b>Tinnitus</b>, or ringing in the ears, is also a common symptom experienced by patients with Meniere's disease. The exact cause remains unclear but it may be related to alterations in blood flow or nerve signals within the inner ear.<br /><br />Lastly, <b>Nystagmus</b>, which refers to involuntary eye movements often seen during acute attacks of vertigo, can also occur in patients suffering from Meniere's disease. While nystagmus isn't necessarily present all the time in these patients, it can certainly manifest during periods where other symptoms such as vertigo are exacerbated.",

            "<b>Slipped upper femoral epiphysis (SUFE)</b> is correct. This is a rare hip condition seen in children (10-15 years), particularly obese boys. The condition causes displacement of the femoral head epiphysis posteroinferiorly causing hip, groin, and medial thigh +/- knee pain. Loss of internal rotation of the leg whilst in flexion may also be seen.<br /><br /><b>Juvenile idiopathic arthritis</b> (JIA) is incorrect. JIA is characterised by joint inflammation persisting for at least six weeks in children under the age of 16 years. All other causes of joint inflammation must be excluded to make the diagnosis. The relatively short history of hip pain in this patient's presentation, combined with being overweight is more indicative of SUFE.<br /><br /><b>Legg-Calve-Perthe's disease</b> is incorrect. This is characterised by necrosis of the femoral head that is most often seen in young boys aged between 4-8 years. Symptoms include a painless limp and a restricted range of movement. The presence of painful hip movements in an overweight 12-year-old makes SUFE more likely.<br /><br /><b>Septic arthritis</b> is incorrect.

        "question": "A 12-year-old boy is seen in the paediatric clinic with his mother. She tells you that her son has been limping over the last week with complaints of pain in his left hip and groin. There is no history of trauma to note. His past medical history includes eczema and he completed a course of antibiotics for tonsillitis 3 weeks ago.<br /><br />On examination, there is palpable tenderness in the left groin, hip and knee. There is a loss of internal rotation of left hip flexion due to extreme pain. He is in the 95th percentile of weight for his age.<br /><br />What is the most likely diagnosis?",
        "correct_answer": "4",
        "question_notes": "<b>Slipped upper femoral epiphysis (SUFE)</b> is correct. This is a rare hip condition seen in children (10-15 years), particularly obese boys. The condition causes displacement of the femoral head epiphysis posteroinferiorly causing hip, groin, and medial thigh +/- knee pain. Loss of internal rotation of the leg whilst in flexion may also be seen.<br /><br /><b>Juvenile idiopathic arthritis</b> (JIA) is incorrect. JIA is characterised by joint inflammation persisting for at least six weeks in children under the age of 16 years. All other causes of joint inflammation must be excluded to make the diagnosis. The relatively short history of hip pain in this patient's presentation, combined with being overweight is more indicative of SUFE.<br /><br /><b>Legg-Calve-Perthe's disease</b> is incorrect. This is characterised by necrosis of the femoral head that is most often seen in young boys aged between 4-8 years. Symptoms include a painless limp and a restricted range of movement. The presence of painful hip movements in an overweight 12-year-old makes SUFE more likely.<br /><br /><b>Septic arthritis</b> is incorrect.

            "<b>Uncal herniation</b> is the most likely diagnosis. The clinical picture is highly suggestive of a process causing significantly raised intracranial pressure (ICP). The history of several weeks of worsening headache, particularly on waking, is a classic feature of raised ICP, likely secondary to an underlying space-occupying lesion (e.g., tumour, abscess, or chronic subdural haematoma). The acute deterioration with confusion, coupled with the signs of an ipsilateral third nerve palsy (oculomotor nerve), points towards transtentorial (uncal) herniation. As the ICP rises, the uncus (the innermost part of the temporal lobe) is forced through the tentorial notch, compressing adjacent structures. The third cranial nerve is particularly vulnerable as it passes through this space. Compression of the nerve affects the outer parasympathetic fibres first, leading to a fixed, dilated pupil. Further compression affects the motor fibres, causing ptosis and the characteristic 'down and out' deviation of the eye due to the unopposed action of the superior oblique (CN IV) and lateral rectus (CN VI) muscles. This is a life-threatening neurological emergency requiring immediate investigation and intervention.<br /><br /><b>Cavernous sinus thrombosis</b> is a less likely diagnosis. While it can cause a third nerve palsy, it typically presents with a constellation of other signs due to the involvement of multiple structures within the sinus. This includes palsies of cranial nerves IV, VI, and the V1/V2 branches of V. Clinically, this would manifest with ophthalmoplegia, facial sensory loss, and prominent signs of orbital venous congestion such as proptosis, periorbital oedema, and chemosis. The patient's presentation is isolated to a third nerve palsy with signs of raised ICP, making this diagnosis less probable.<br /><br /><b>Diabetic mononeuropathy</b> is a common cause of a third nerve palsy but is inconsistent with this presentation. This condition is caused by microvascular ischaemia to the vasa nervorum supplying the nerve. This ischaemia preferentially affects the central fibres of the nerve, which control the extraocular muscles, while sparing the peripherally located parasympathetic fibres that control the pupil. Therefore, a diabetic third nerve palsy is classically 'pupil-sparing'. The presence of a fixed, dilated pupil in this patient is a red flag sign that strongly argues against a microvascular cause and points towards a compressive lesion.<br /><br /><b>Midbrain infarction</b>, specifically Weber's syndrome, involves an infarct in the territory of the posterior cerebral artery that supplies the cerebral peduncle of the midbrain. This results in an ipsilateral third nerve palsy (as the nerve fascicles are damaged) and a contralateral hemiplegia (due to damage to the adjacent corticospinal tract). The scenario does not describe any contralateral motor deficit, and the subacute history of worsening headaches is more suggestive of a progressive mass lesion than an acute vascular event.<br /><br /><b>Posterior communicating artery aneurysm</b> is an important differential for a pupil-involving third nerve palsy. An expanding aneurysm can compress the third nerve, causing pain and neurological signs similar to those described. However, the onset is typically more acute and painful. While it can cause a headache, the prolonged history of headaches that are worse on waking is much more characteristic of generalised raised ICP from a space-occupying lesion leading to herniation, rather than direct compression from an aneurysm.",
