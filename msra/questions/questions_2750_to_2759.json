            "The correct answer in this case is to <b>add a long-acting dihydropyridine calcium-channel blocker</b>. This is because, according to the UK guidelines for angina management, when beta-blockers are not sufficient to control anginal symptoms, the addition of a long-acting dihydropyridine calcium-channel blocker (such as amlodipine) is recommended. These medications help to reduce myocardial oxygen demand by causing vasodilation and reducing afterload, which can alleviate anginal symptoms.<br /><br />Adding an <b>ACE inhibitor</b> would not be the most appropriate next step in this scenario. While ACE inhibitors can have some beneficial effects on cardiovascular outcomes and are commonly used in patients with heart failure or after myocardial infarction, they do not directly address the issue of uncontrolled angina pectoris.<br /><br /><b>Add nicorandil</b> could be considered if other anti-anginal medications are contraindicated or not tolerated. However, it is not the first-line choice when adding a second agent for symptom control according to UK guidelines. Nicorandil acts as both a potassium channel opener and nitrate-like compound, leading to arterial and venous dilation.<br /><br /><b>Add isosorbide mononitrate MR</b> (modified-release) may also provide additional relief from anginal symptoms due to its vasodilatory properties as a nitrate medication. However, it should be noted that nitrates are generally added as third-line agents after beta-blockers and calcium-channel blockers in the management of stable angina pectoris.<br /><br />Finally, <b>referring for revascularisation</b>, such as percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) or coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG), may eventually become necessary if medical therapy fails to adequately control symptoms or if there are high-risk features present. However, it is not the most appropriate next step in this case, as the patient has not yet trialled an optimal medical therapy regimen for angina control.",

        "correct_answer": "5",
        "question_notes": "The correct answer in this case is to <b>add a long-acting dihydropyridine calcium-channel blocker</b>. This is because, according to the UK guidelines for angina management, when beta-blockers are not sufficient to control anginal symptoms, the addition of a long-acting dihydropyridine calcium-channel blocker (such as amlodipine) is recommended. These medications help to reduce myocardial oxygen demand by causing vasodilation and reducing afterload, which can alleviate anginal symptoms.<br /><br />Adding an <b>ACE inhibitor</b> would not be the most appropriate next step in this scenario. While ACE inhibitors can have some beneficial effects on cardiovascular outcomes and are commonly used in patients with heart failure or after myocardial infarction, they do not directly address the issue of uncontrolled angina pectoris.<br /><br /><b>Add nicorandil</b> could be considered if other anti-anginal medications are contraindicated or not tolerated. However, it is not the first-line choice when adding a second agent for symptom control according to UK guidelines. Nicorandil acts as both a potassium channel opener and nitrate-like compound, leading to arterial and venous dilation.<br /><br /><b>Add isosorbide mononitrate MR</b> (modified-release) may also provide additional relief from anginal symptoms due to its vasodilatory properties as a nitrate medication. However, it should be noted that nitrates are generally added as third-line agents after beta-blockers and calcium-channel blockers in the management of stable angina pectoris.<br /><br />Finally, <b>referring for revascularisation</b>, such as percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) or coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG), may eventually become necessary if medical therapy fails to adequately control symptoms or if there are high-risk features present. However, it is not the most appropriate next step in this case, as the patient has not yet trialled an optimal medical therapy regimen for angina control.",

            "The correct answer is <b>Irritant dermatitis</b>. This condition, also known as nappy rash or diaper dermatitis, is the most common cause of nappy rash in infants. It is caused by prolonged exposure to urine and faeces that irritates the skin, leading to an erythematous rash in the nappy area with flexural sparing (as these areas are less likely to be in contact with irritants). The rash often appears abruptly and can vary from mild (with only slight redness) to severe (with bright red, shiny inflammation).<br /><br /><b>Psoriasis</b> is an unlikely diagnosis in this case. While it can occur at any age, onset before age 1 is extremely rare. Psoriasis tends to be well-demarcated, scaly plaques typically affecting extensor surfaces such as the elbows and knees rather than the nappy area. <br /><br /><b>Seborrhoeic dermatitis</b> typically affects areas rich in sebaceous glands such as the scalp ('cradle cap'), face and upper trunk. In infants, it may involve the groin but usually alongside the involvement of other sebum-rich areas.<br /><br />An <i><b>Candida</b></i> infection could potentially cause a similar rash but there would typically be satellite lesions - small red spots away from the main area of redness - which have not been described here.<br /><br /><b>Atopic eczema</b>, another common condition in infancy, usually starts on the face or body before spreading to other areas including flexures (opposite pattern compared to irritant dermatitis), and does not specifically affect the nappy area. Eczema often has a chronic relapsing course and may be associated with a personal or family history of atopy (asthma, hay fever or eczema).",

            "<b>Increase to a moderate-dose ICS/formoterol MART regimen</b> is the correct answer. This patient has a diagnosis of asthma and is currently being managed with a low-dose inhaled corticosteroid (ICS)/formoterol combination inhaler for both maintenance and reliever therapy (MART). This corresponds to Step 2 of the 2024 joint NICE/BTS/SIGN asthma guidelines. The patient's symptoms, including nocturnal waking twice a week and using their reliever inhaler more than twice a week, indicate that their asthma is not well controlled. Since inhaler technique and adherence have been confirmed as adequate, a step-up in pharmacological treatment is required. The next step in the treatment algorithm (Step 3) is to increase the maintenance dose to a moderate-dose ICS/formoterol combination, while continuing to use it as the reliever (moderate-dose MART). This increases the baseline anti-inflammatory effect to improve overall control, while maintaining the benefit of a single inhaler for both prevention and relief.<br /><br /><b>Add a leukotriene receptor antagonist</b> is incorrect. While leukotriene receptor antagonists (LTRAs) like montelukast have a role in asthma management, they are considered at a later stage in the current treatment pathway. According to the 2024 guidelines, an LTRA is a potential add-on therapy at Step 4, to be trialled if asthma remains uncontrolled despite treatment with a moderate-dose MART regimen. It is not the recommended next step for a patient whose asthma is uncontrolled on low-dose MART.<br /><br /><b>Add a long-acting muscarinic antagonist</b> is also incorrect. Similar to LTRAs, a long-acting muscarinic antagonist (LAMA) is an add-on therapy considered at Step 4 of the management algorithm. This would only be considered after a trial of moderate-dose MART has proven insufficient to control the patient's symptoms. It is therefore premature to add a LAMA at this stage.<br /><br /><b>Add a short-acting beta-2 agonist for relief</b> is incorrect and represents a move away from modern asthma management principles. The MART regimen, using a combination ICS/formoterol inhaler for relief, is specifically designed to replace the need for a separate short-acting beta-2 agonist (SABA) reliever. A key principle of the new guidelines is to ensure that whenever a reliever is used, an anti-inflammatory component (ICS) is delivered alongside it, reducing the risks associated with SABA-only relief. Re-introducing a SABA would be contrary to this evidence-based approach.<br /><br /><b>Refer to a respiratory specialist</b> is not appropriate at this stage. Referral to secondary care is recommended at Step 5 of the pathway. This is for patients whose asthma remains uncontrolled despite treatment with moderate-dose MART and trials of add-on therapies (LTRA and LAMA), or for those who may require high-dose ICS or biologic therapies.

        "body": "In 2024 NICE, the British Thoracic Society and SIGN produced joint guidelines on the management of asthma following many years of conflicting guidelines. The new guidelines represent a major step change in the management of asthma is both diagnosed and treated.<br /><br />For many years patients with asthma were started on a short-acting beta-2 agonist (SABA) inhaler before 'stepping up' to a regular inhaled corticosteroid with a SABA as required. The new guidelines now advocate the use of combined inhalers (ICS + long-acting beta-2 agonist) as reliever therapy or regularly, depending on the severity of asthma. Given the prevalence of asthma, it is likely that doctors will have to deal with patients on 'conventional' asthma treatments for many years to come. The joint guidelines therefore include guidance on how to manage these patients if their current treatment is controlling their symptoms sufficiently.<br /><br /><h5 class='notes-heading'>Management of adult patients aged children aged \u2265 12 years with newly diagnosed asthma</h5><br />Step 1 <a href='https://www.nice.org.uk/guidance/ng245/chapter/Recommendations#pharmacological-management-in-people-aged-12-and-over:~:text=and%20over.-,Initial%20management%20of%20newly%20diagnosed%20asthma%20in%20people%20aged%2012%20and%20over,-1.7.1' title='NICE - 2024 Asthma: diagnosis, monitoring and chronic asthma management (BTS, NICE, SIGN)' target='_blank' class='badge rounded-pill text-bg-light deeplink'>NICE</a><ul><li>a <span class=\"concept\" data-cid=\"12286\">low-dose inhaled corticosteroid (ICS)/formoterol combination inhaler to be taken as needed for symptom relief</span><ul><li>this is termed anti-inflammatory reliever (AIR) therapy</li></ul></li><li>if the patient presents highly symptomatic (for example, regular nocturnal waking) or with a severe exacerbation:<ul><li><span class=\"concept\" data-cid=\"12295\">start treatment with low-dose MART</span> (maintenance and reliever therapy, see below)</li><li>treat the acute symptoms as appropriate (e.g. a course of oral corticosteroids may be indicated)</li></ul></li></ul><br />Step 2  <a href='https://www.nice.org.uk/guidance/ng245/chapter/Recommendations#pharmacological-management-in-people-aged-12-and-over:~:text=asthma%20management.-,Medicine%20combination%20and%20sequencing%20in%20people%20aged%2012%20and%20over,-For%20guidance%20on' title='NICE - 2024 Asthma: diagnosis, monitoring and chronic asthma management (BTS, NICE, SIGN)' target='_blank' class='badge rounded-pill text-bg-light deeplink'>NICE</a> <br /><ul><li><span class=\"concept\" data-cid=\"12287\">a low-dose MART</span><ul><li>MART describes using an inhaled corticosteroid (ICS)/formoterol combination inhaler for daily maintenance therapy and the relief of symptoms as needed, i.e. regularly and as required</li></ul></li></ul><br />Step 3<br /><ul><li>a <span class=\"concept\" data-cid=\"12288\">moderate-dose MART</span></li></ul><br />Step 4<br /><ul><li><span class=\"concept\" data-cid=\"12289\">check the fractional exhaled nitric oxide (FeNO) level if available, and the blood eosinophil count</span>  <a href='https://www.nice.org.uk/guidance/ng245/chapter/Recommendations#pharmacological-management-in-people-aged-12-and-over:~:text=Check%20the%20fractional%20exhaled%20nitric%20oxide%20(FeNO)%20level%20if%20available' title='NICE - 2024 Asthma: diagnosis, monitoring and chronic asthma management (BTS, NICE, SIGN)' target='_blank' class='badge rounded-pill text-bg-light deeplink'>NICE</a> <ul><li>if <span class=\"concept\" data-cid=\"12290\">either of these is raised, refer to a specialist in asthma care</span></li><li>if <span class=\"concept\" data-cid=\"12291\">neither FeNO nor eosinophil count is raised, consider a trial of either a leukotriene receptor antagonist (LTRA) or a long-acting muscarinic receptor antagonist (LAMA)</span> used in addition to moderate-dose MART</li><li>if control has not improved, stop the LTRA or LAMA and start a trial of the alternative medicine (LTRA or LAMA)</li></ul></li></ul><br />Step 5<br /><ul><li><span class=\"concept\" data-cid=\"12292\">refer people to a specialist in asthma care</span> when asthma is not controlled despite treatment with moderate-dose MART, and trials of an LTRA and a LAMA</li></ul><br /><div class=\"container\"><div class=\"row\"><div class=\"col-md-3\"><a href=\"https://d32xxyeh8kfs8k.cloudfront.net/images_Passmedicine/pdd602b.png\" data-fancybox=\"gallery\" data-caption=\"Algorithm showing pharmacological management of asthma in people aged 12 years and over\"><img  class=\"img-thumbnail mx-auto d-block\" style=\"max-height:150px;margin-bottom:10px;\" src=\"https://d32xxyeh8kfs8k.cloudfront.net/images_Passmedicine/pdd602.png\" alt=\"\" /></a></div></div></div><br /><h5 class='notes-heading'>Transferring people aged 12 and over from other treatment pathways</h5><br />There will be many people whose asthma was managed according to the previous guidelines that present with uncontrolled asthmatic symptoms.

            "<b>Duloxetine</b> is the correct answer. Duloxetine, a serotonin-norepinephrine re-uptake inhibitor, can be used to treat patients with stress urinary incontinence who have not responded to pelvic floor muscle exercises and who are not suitable for surgical intervention. It works by increasing the urethral closure force, thereby improving symptoms of stress incontinence. Patients should be re-assessed after 2-4 weeks of treatment to evaluate the benefit and tolerability of the treatment. It is worth noting that had the patient been open to surgery, a referral would have been warranted if 3 months of supervised pelvic floor muscle training had not been successful at controlling her symptoms. <br /><br />The patient is presenting with symptoms consistent with stress urinary incontinence (SUI), which involves involuntary leakage of urine during activities that increase intra-abdominal pressure such as coughing or laughing. This is often due to a weakening of the pelvic floor muscles. Duloxetine, a combined noradrenaline and serotonin re-uptake inhibitor, is recommended by NICE in the management of SUI who are not suitable for surgical management. It works by increasing synaptic concentration of noradrenaline and serotonin within the pudendal nerve, leading to increased stimulation of urethral muscles within the sphincter, improving its contraction. As the patient in this scenario has not responded to pelvic floor muscle training and does not wish to have surgery, duloxetine should be considered. <br /><br /><b>Oxybutynin</b> is primarily used to manage symptoms of an overactive bladder or urge incontinence, such as urinary urgency and frequency, which are not the presenting symptoms in the case of stress incontinence. Oxybutynin, tolterodine, or darifenacin can all be used first-line for urge incontinence if a 6-week course of bladder training has been unsuccessful.<br /><br /><b>Imipramine</b>, a tricyclic antidepressant with anticholinergic and alpha-adrenergic agonist properties, is sometimes used off-label for mixed incontinence but not specifically for stress incontinence, and its side effect profile may pose risks.

        "question": "A 64-year-old woman returns to your clinic after having had 3 months of supervised pelvic floor muscle training which she reports has been unsuccessful at managing her symptoms. She has been experiencing urinary leakage when laughing or coughing, but denies any urgency, dysuria, or frequency. She does not wish to have surgery.<br /><br />What medication may she benefit from?",
        "correct_answer": "2",
        "question_notes": "<b>Duloxetine</b> is the correct answer. Duloxetine, a serotonin-norepinephrine re-uptake inhibitor, can be used to treat patients with stress urinary incontinence who have not responded to pelvic floor muscle exercises and who are not suitable for surgical intervention. It works by increasing the urethral closure force, thereby improving symptoms of stress incontinence. Patients should be re-assessed after 2-4 weeks of treatment to evaluate the benefit and tolerability of the treatment. It is worth noting that had the patient been open to surgery, a referral would have been warranted if 3 months of supervised pelvic floor muscle training had not been successful at controlling her symptoms. <br /><br />The patient is presenting with symptoms consistent with stress urinary incontinence (SUI), which involves involuntary leakage of urine during activities that increase intra-abdominal pressure such as coughing or laughing. This is often due to a weakening of the pelvic floor muscles. Duloxetine, a combined noradrenaline and serotonin re-uptake inhibitor, is recommended by NICE in the management of SUI who are not suitable for surgical management. It works by increasing synaptic concentration of noradrenaline and serotonin within the pudendal nerve, leading to increased stimulation of urethral muscles within the sphincter, improving its contraction. As the patient in this scenario has not responded to pelvic floor muscle training and does not wish to have surgery, duloxetine should be considered. <br /><br /><b>Oxybutynin</b> is primarily used to manage symptoms of an overactive bladder or urge incontinence, such as urinary urgency and frequency, which are not the presenting symptoms in the case of stress incontinence. Oxybutynin, tolterodine, or darifenacin can all be used first-line for urge incontinence if a 6-week course of bladder training has been unsuccessful.<br /><br /><b>Imipramine</b>, a tricyclic antidepressant with anticholinergic and alpha-adrenergic agonist properties, is sometimes used off-label for mixed incontinence but not specifically for stress incontinence, and its side effect profile may pose risks. NICE recommend that mixed urinary incontinence is treated the same as either urge incontinence or stress incontinence according to the predominant symptoms. <br /><br /><b>Amitriptyline</b>, another tricyclic antidepressant, is not typically used for stress incontinence. While it has anticholinergic properties that can affect bladder function, it is not the treatment of choice for this condition.<br /><br /><b>Topical oestrogen</b> may be used to improve symptoms of urinary incontinence related to atrophic vaginitis in postmenopausal women but is not the primary therapy for stress incontinence.",
