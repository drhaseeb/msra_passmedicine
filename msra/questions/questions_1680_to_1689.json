            "The correct answer is <b>absent corneal reflex</b>. An acoustic neuroma, also known as vestibular schwannoma, is a benign tumour that arises from the vestibular part of the eighth cranial nerve (vestibulocochlear nerve). This nerve has two parts; the cochlear part which is involved in hearing and the vestibular part which is involved in balance. As the tumour grows, it can compress nearby structures including the fifth cranial nerve (trigeminal nerve), which mediates the corneal reflex. Therefore, an absent corneal reflex could be indicative of an acoustic neuroma.<br /><br /><b>Jerky nystagmus</b> can occur with vestibular schwannomas but it's not specific to this condition and can occur in many other conditions affecting the central nervous system such as multiple sclerosis or cerebrovascular disease. Additionally, jerky nystagmus would not typically present alone but with other symptoms of vestibular dysfunction like vertigo.<br /><br /><b>Left homonymous hemianopia</b>, a loss of half of the field of view on the same side in both eyes, indicates damage to right optic tract or visual cortex rather than an issue with cranial nerves V or VIII. It's more commonly associated with stroke, brain injuries or tumours affecting these areas rather than an acoustic neuroma.<br /><br />The option <b>tongue deviated to the left</b> suggests damage to the hypoglossal nerve (cranial nerve XII), which controls tongue movements. If damaged, the tongue will deviate towards the side of lesion when protruded due to unopposed action of muscles on opposite side. It's not associated with acoustic neuromas.<br /><br />Finally, <b>fasciculation of the tongue</b> refers to involuntary contractions or twitching in tongue muscle fibres. It's a common sign in motor neurone diseases and disorders involving lower motor neurons that supply tongue muscles. This symptom does not indicate an acoustic neuroma.<br />",

            "The image used in this question is the tracing of a 12-lead ECG. This ECG shows evidence of supraventricular tachycardia. We can work out the heart rate by counting the number of big squares across an R-R interval. In this ECG there are about 2 big squares for every R-R interval. Now, we take the number 2 and use it to divide 300 by - 300 represents one minute.  300/2  = 150. Therefore, the approximate heart rate is 150bpm. We can then deduce that this is supraventricular tachycardia by the narrow QRS complex (<0.1s). The QRS in this case is about 1-2 little squares and this equates to 0.04-0.08s, which is narrow. <br /><br />This patient is presenting with palpitations and an extremely raised heart rate of 150 bpm. His ECG revealed supraventricular tachycardia (SVT). Therefore, this patient requires treatment to terminate the SVT. The question tells you that the patient has already attempted vagal manoeuvres. As the SVT is still present after attempting vagal manoeuvres, it is important to move on to the second-line treatment option - adenosine. <br /><br /><b>Intravenous adenosine</b> is correct. This patient is experiencing an SVT that failed to resolve with vagal manoeuvres. Therefore, an IV bolus of 6mg of adenosine should be given immediately. If this is unsuccessful, a further 12mg rapid bolus should be given. If this again is unsuccessful, you should give an 18mg rapid bolus of adenosine. Adenosine is an antiarrhythmic drug that works on cardiac receptors in the AV node to slow conduction time. <br /><br /><b>Amiodarone - through a central line</b> is incorrect. Amiodarone through a central line is used to terminate ventricular tachycardia. This patient is experiencing an SVT - occurring above the ventricles; therefore, amiodarone should not be given, especially through a central line. <br /><br /><b>DC cardioversion</b> is incorrect. Although DC cardioversion can be used to terminate SVT, it is not the second-line option. Adenosine should be trialled before DC cardioversion. <br /><br /><b>Intravenous atropine</b> is incorrect. Intravenous atropine is commonly used to terminate bradycardia. Atropine works to increase the heart rate and so would be inappropriate for this patient. <br /><br /><b>Vagal manoeuvres</b> is incorrect. Vagal manoeuvres should be trialled the first line for patients experiencing an SVT. However, this patient has already tried vagal manoeuvres and they have proven to be unsuccessful.

            "<b>Deliver a single unsynchronised DC shock</b> is the correct immediate action. The patient is in cardiac arrest, and the rhythm identified is a broad complex, regular tachycardia. In a pulseless patient, this rhythm is pulseless Ventricular Tachycardia (pVT). According to the UK Resuscitation Council guidelines, pVT and Ventricular Fibrillation (VF) are 'shockable' rhythms. The definitive and most critical initial treatment is immediate defibrillation. A common point of confusion is whether this constitutes Pulseless Electrical Activity (PEA). PEA is defined as organised electrical activity on the monitor <i>in the absence of a pulse</i>, but this definition specifically excludes VF and pVT. Therefore, this scenario is pVT, not PEA, and requires a shock. The shock should be unsynchronised because in a pulseless patient, there is no need to synchronise the shock with the R-wave, a process which is reserved for unstable patients with a pulse to avoid the R-on-T phenomenon. An unsynchronised shock can be delivered faster, which is critical.<br /><br /><b>Administer 1 mg adrenaline IV</b> is incorrect. While adrenaline is a key drug in cardiac arrest, its timing is crucial. For non-shockable rhythms (PEA and asystole), adrenaline 1 mg is given as soon as IV/IO access is obtained. However, for shockable rhythms (VF/pVT), the priority is defibrillation. Adrenaline is only administered after the third shock has been delivered. Giving adrenaline before the first shock would unnecessarily delay the single most important intervention for this patient, which is defibrillation.<br /><br /><b>Administer 300 mg amiodarone IV</b> is incorrect. Amiodarone is an anti-arrhythmic drug used for shock-refractory VF/pVT. According to the ALS algorithm, a 300 mg IV bolus of amiodarone should be considered after the third shock has been delivered. It is not an initial intervention and should not be given before the first attempts at defibrillation. Its role is to help stabilise the myocardium and prevent recurrence of the arrhythmia after the initial shocks have failed.<br /><br /><b>Continue CPR for 2 minutes</b> is incorrect as the immediate next step. High-quality CPR with minimal interruptions is a cornerstone of resuscitation, but it is not the definitive treatment for a shockable rhythm. The algorithm is clear: once a shockable rhythm is identified, a shock should be delivered as soon as possible. CPR should be performed while the defibrillator is charging to minimise the 'hands-off' time, but once charged, the shock must be delivered. CPR is then immediately resumed for 2 minutes <i>after</i> the shock, without an immediate rhythm or pulse check.<br /><br /><b>Deliver a single synchronised DC shock</b> is incorrect. Synchronised cardioversion is the treatment for patients with a tachyarrhythmia (like VT or AF) who are haemodynamically unstable but <i>still have a cardiac output</i> (i.e., they have a pulse). The synchronisation function aligns the shock with the R-wave of the ECG to avoid delivering it during the vulnerable T-wave period. In a pulseless patient (cardiac arrest), there is no cardiac output, so this precaution is unnecessary and causes a slight delay. The correct procedure is an immediate unsynchronised shock.",

            "Subacute (De Quervain's thyroiditis) is an acute and painful swelling to the thyroid gland, likely preceded by a viral infection. There is an initial period of hyperthyroid, due to the release of thyroid hormone from damaged cells. Following the hyperthyroid state, a period of hypothyroid then ensues, eventually resolving back to a euthyroid state. The point that differentiates this diagnosis from the rest is a tender goitre, which is not anticipated in other causes of thyrotoxicosis. <br /><br />Follicular carcinoma of the thyroid accounts for approximately 15% of thyroid carcinomas, more common in females, with the peak incidence in the 40-60 age bracket. Presentation is commonly an asymptomatic thyroid mass that is painless, and not associated with abnormal thyroid activity. <br /><br />Grave's disease is a hyperthyroid state caused by autoimmune activation of TSH receptors. A goitre is usually present, but this would be painless on palpation. Associated proptosis and pretibial myxoedema can also present alongside the classic symptoms of thyrotoxicosis. <br /><br />Hashimoto's disease, which is autoimmune-mediated thyroiditis, causes a hypothyroid state. A goitre can be present but would not be tender upon palpation. <br /><br />Papillary carcinoma is the most common well-differentiated thyroid cancer.

        "question_notes": "Subacute (De Quervain's thyroiditis) is an acute and painful swelling to the thyroid gland, likely preceded by a viral infection. There is an initial period of hyperthyroid, due to the release of thyroid hormone from damaged cells. Following the hyperthyroid state, a period of hypothyroid then ensues, eventually resolving back to a euthyroid state. The point that differentiates this diagnosis from the rest is a tender goitre, which is not anticipated in other causes of thyrotoxicosis. <br /><br />Follicular carcinoma of the thyroid accounts for approximately 15% of thyroid carcinomas, more common in females, with the peak incidence in the 40-60 age bracket. Presentation is commonly an asymptomatic thyroid mass that is painless, and not associated with abnormal thyroid activity. <br /><br />Grave's disease is a hyperthyroid state caused by autoimmune activation of TSH receptors. A goitre is usually present, but this would be painless on palpation. Associated proptosis and pretibial myxoedema can also present alongside the classic symptoms of thyrotoxicosis. <br /><br />Hashimoto's disease, which is autoimmune-mediated thyroiditis, causes a hypothyroid state. A goitre can be present but would not be tender upon palpation. <br /><br />Papillary carcinoma is the most common well-differentiated thyroid cancer.

            "The correct answer is <b>Herpes zoster ophthalmicus</b>. This condition presents with a painful, blistering rash in the distribution of the ophthalmic division of the trigeminal nerve. It is caused by reactivation of latent varicella-zoster virus (the same virus that causes chickenpox) within the sensory ganglion. The patient's age and presentation with a burning sensation around his right eye followed by an erythematous blistering rash are typical features of this condition.<br /><br /><b>Ramsay Hunt syndrome</b>, also known as herpes zoster oticus, is an incorrect option here. This condition involves reactivation of varicella-zoster virus in the geniculate ganglion, resulting in a characteristic triad of ipsilateral facial paralysis, ear pain and vesicles in the auditory canal and/or on the tympanic membrane. Although it can cause facial pain due to involvement of cranial nerves VII and VIII, it does not typically present with ocular symptoms or a rash in the trigeminal distribution.<br /><br /><b>Cluster headache</b> is another incorrect option. These are severe unilateral headaches often accompanied by autonomic symptoms such as lacrimation, nasal congestion or ptosis. Although they may cause significant periorbital discomfort, they do not cause an erythematous blistering rash.<br /><br /><b>Fungal keratitis</b> is also not likely given this presentation. Fungal keratitis would typically present with eye redness, reduced vision, photophobia and a corneal ulcer visible on slit-lamp examination rather than a dermatomal rash.<br /><br />Finally, <b>Trigeminal neuralgia</b> is characterised by severe episodic facial pain but does not cause a skin rash. The pain in trigeminal neuralgia tends to be electric shock-like and lasts from seconds to minutes rather than being a persistent burning sensation as our patient has reported.<br />",
