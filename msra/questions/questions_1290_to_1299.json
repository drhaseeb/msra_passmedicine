            "<b>Haemorrhagic disease of the newborn</b> is the correct answer. This infant presents with the classic features of vitamin K deficiency bleeding (VKDB), previously known as haemorrhagic disease of the newborn. The combination of rectal bleeding and bruising in an exclusively breastfed 6-week-old infant who was born at home is highly suggestive. Home births may be associated with missed vitamin K prophylaxis, either because it was declined or not offered. Breast milk contains very low levels of vitamin K compared to formula milk, placing exclusively breastfed infants at particular risk. This presentation at 6 weeks represents late VKDB (occurring between 2-12 weeks of age), which typically presents with bleeding from various sites including gastrointestinal tract, skin, and potentially intracranial haemorrhage. The condition results from inadequate vitamin K-dependent clotting factor synthesis (factors II, VII, IX, and X). All newborns in the UK should be offered vitamin K prophylaxis, either as a single intramuscular dose or multiple oral doses if breastfeeding continues.<br /><br /><b>Cow's milk protein allergy</b> is incorrect. Whilst this can cause rectal bleeding in infants, it typically presents with other features such as vomiting, diarrhoea, eczema, or failure to thrive. The bleeding is usually due to allergic colitis causing blood-streaked stools rather than frank rectal bleeding. Importantly, it would not explain the bruising on the thighs. This infant is exclusively breastfed, though maternal dairy consumption can occasionally trigger symptoms in sensitised infants.<br /><br /><b>Intussusception</b> is incorrect. This typically presents in infants aged 6-18 months with colicky abdominal pain, vomiting, and the classic 'redcurrant jelly' stools. The infant would usually appear unwell and distressed during episodes of pain, drawing their knees up. At 6 weeks of age, intussusception is extremely rare. Additionally, intussusception would not explain the bruising, and the infant in this scenario appears alert and well between episodes, which is inconsistent with this diagnosis.<br /><br /><b>Haemophilia A</b> is incorrect. Whilst this X-linked recessive condition causes a bleeding tendency due to factor VIII deficiency, it would be unusual to present with spontaneous bruising and rectal bleeding at this age without a clear precipitant such as trauma or circumcision. Haemophilia typically presents with bleeding into joints and muscles rather than gastrointestinal bleeding. The timing and presentation are much more consistent with acquired vitamin K deficiency rather than an inherited coagulopathy.<br /><br /><b>Meckel's diverticulum</b> is incorrect. This congenital abnormality can cause painless rectal bleeding due to ectopic gastric mucosa causing ulceration. However, it typically presents later in childhood (usually after 2 years of age) and would not explain the bruising. The bleeding from Meckel's diverticulum is usually more significant and can cause anaemia. The combination of bleeding and bruising in this exclusively breastfed infant with potential missed vitamin K prophylaxis makes VKDB far more likely.",

            "<b><i>Candida</i></b> is the most likely diagnosis in this case. The patient presents with a curd-like white vaginal discharge, which is the classic description of candidal discharge, often referred to as 'cottage cheese-like' in appearance. Additionally, she reports pain during intercourse (dyspareunia), which is consistent with the vulvovaginal inflammation caused by candidal infection. Candidiasis is a common fungal infection caused by Candida albicans in approximately 90% of cases, with other species accounting for the remainder. Risk factors include recent antibiotic use, diabetes, immunosuppression, and pregnancy. The diagnosis is typically made clinically based on the characteristic discharge and symptoms, though microscopy and culture can confirm the diagnosis. Treatment involves topical or oral antifungal medications such as clotrimazole or fluconazole.<br /><br /><b>Bacterial vaginosis (BV)</b> is an incorrect diagnosis for this patient. While BV is a common cause of vaginal discharge, it typically presents with a thin, homogeneous, white or grey discharge that has a characteristic 'fishy' odour, particularly noticeable after sexual intercourse. The discharge in BV is not curd-like or cottage cheese-like as described in this case. Additionally, BV is not typically associated with pain during intercourse, as it does not cause significant inflammation of the vaginal tissues. BV results from an overgrowth of anaerobic bacteria and a reduction in the normal lactobacilli population in the vagina, leading to an increase in vaginal pH above 4.5.<br /><br /><b><i>Trichomonas vaginalis</i></b> is an incorrect diagnosis for this scenario. Trichomoniasis is a sexually transmitted infection caused by the protozoan parasite Trichomonas vaginalis. The discharge associated with trichomoniasis is typically yellow-green, frothy, and malodorous, not white and curd-like as described in this case. While trichomoniasis can cause dyspareunia due to inflammation, the character of the discharge is inconsistent with the patient's presentation. On examination, patients with trichomoniasis may have a 'strawberry cervix' due to punctate haemorrhages, and there may be significant vulvovaginal inflammation.<br /><br /><b>Physiological discharge</b> is an incorrect diagnosis for this patient. While all women have some degree of physiological vaginal discharge that varies throughout the menstrual cycle, physiological discharge is typically clear to white, non-offensive, and does not cause symptoms such as pain during intercourse. The curd-like appearance described in this case is not consistent with normal physiological discharge. Physiological discharge is primarily composed of cervical and vaginal secretions, exfoliated epithelial cells, and normal vaginal flora. It typically increases around ovulation and may change in consistency but should not cause discomfort or irritation.<br /><br /><b>Chlamydial cervicitis</b> is an incorrect diagnosis for this patient. Chlamydia trachomatis infection primarily affects the cervix in women and can cause a mucopurulent cervical discharge. However, this discharge is typically yellow or cloudy rather than white and curd-like. While chlamydial infection can cause dyspareunia, the character of the discharge in this case is much more consistent with candidiasis. Additionally, chlamydial infections are often asymptomatic in women, with up to 70% of infected individuals showing no symptoms. When symptoms do occur, they may include post-coital bleeding, intermenstrual bleeding, or lower abdominal pain, none of which are mentioned in this case.",

            "The correct answer is <b>abdominal mass</b>. Wilms tumour, also known as nephroblastoma, is the most common paediatric renal malignancy. The most common presenting feature is an asymptomatic abdominal mass which is often discovered incidentally by a parent or caregiver while bathing or dressing the child. It typically presents as a smooth, firm and non-tender mass.<br /><br />The option of <b>recurrent urinary tract infections</b> is incorrect. Although urinary tract infections can occur in patients with Wilms tumour due to ureteral obstruction by the tumour, it's not a common presenting feature. Recurrent urinary tract infections are more commonly associated with anatomical abnormalities of the urinary tract or vesicoureteral reflux.<br /><br /><b>Fever</b> is another incorrect option. Fever can be present in cases of Wilms tumour but it's usually secondary to necrosis or infection within the tumour rather than a primary symptom. It's also worth noting that fever without other symptoms is more likely to be caused by an infectious process rather than a neoplastic one.<br /><br />Similarly, <b>loin pain</b> isn't a typical presenting feature of Wilms tumour. Pain may occur if there's rapid growth leading to stretching of the renal capsule or if there's haemorrhage into the tumour but this isn't common at presentation.<br /><br />Finally, <b>haematuria</b>, although possible in cases of Wilms tumour, isn't a frequent symptom either. Haematuria occurs when there's invasion of the renal vessels by the tumour but this tends not to happen until later stages of disease progression. Therefore, while haematuria might be seen in some cases, it's less likely to be the initial presenting feature when compared with an abdominal mass.<br />",

            "The correct answer is <b>Cervical ectropion</b>. Cervical ectropion, also known as cervical erosion, is the most common identifiable cause of postcoital bleeding. It involves the eversion of the endocervical columnar epithelium onto the ectocervix, which can lead to an increased susceptibility to trauma and hence bleeding after intercourse. This condition is particularly common in women of reproductive age and those taking oral contraceptives.<br /><br /><b>Cervical cancer</b> is a less common cause of postcoital bleeding but it's important to consider due to its serious implications. However, other symptoms such as irregular menstrual cycles, pelvic pain or unexplained weight loss often accompany this diagnosis. Therefore, while it must be ruled out in any woman presenting with postcoital bleeding, it's not the most common cause.<br /><br />Similarly, <b>cervical polyps</b> can cause postcoital bleeding but they are not as common as cervical ectropion. These benign growths on the cervix can become irritated and bleed following intercourse. However, they often present asymptomatically and are usually discovered during routine gynaecological examinations.<br /><br /><b>Vaginal trauma</b> could potentially cause bleeding after sexual activity if there was significant force involved or if there were pre-existing lesions in the vagina that were disturbed. However, this would typically be associated with pain and discomfort during intercourse rather than isolated bleeding afterwards.<br /><br />Finally, <b>cervicitis secondary to <i>Chlamydia</i></b> infection could indeed result in postcoital bleeding due to inflammation of the cervix. Nevertheless, other symptoms such as abnormal vaginal discharge or lower abdominal pain would usually be present too. Additionally, sexually transmitted infections including Chlamydia are more likely to cause intermenstrual rather than postcoital bleeding.",

            "The correct answer is <b>Achilles tendonitis is a recognised association</b>. Ankylosing spondylitis (AS) is a chronic, inflammatory arthritis and autoimmune disease that primarily affects the axial skeleton. It can lead to various extra-articular manifestations, one of which includes Achilles tendonitis. This occurs due to enthesitis, inflammation of the areas where tendons or ligaments insert into the bone, which is a characteristic feature of AS.<br /><br /><b>Schober's test assesses reduced chest expansion</b> is incorrect. Schober's test is used in the assessment of lumbar spine mobility and not chest expansion. In AS, chest expansion may be reduced due to costovertebral joint involvement leading to the fusion of the ribs with the vertebrae; however, this is assessed by measuring the circumference of the chest at full inspiration and expiration.<br /><br />The statement <b>HLA-B27 is positive in 50% of patients</b> is also incorrect. Although HLA-B27 antigen has been associated with AS, it's positivity rate in patients with AS is much higher than 50%. According to UK guidelines and research studies, about 90-95% of patients with ankylosing spondylitis are HLA-B27 positive.<br /><br /><b>It is equally common in men and women</b>, this statement isn't accurate either. Ankylosing spondylitis shows a male predominance. It's approximately two to three times more common in men than women.<br /><br />Lastly, <b>The typical age of presentation is between 40-50 years</b> isn't true as well. The typical age of onset for ankylosing spondylitis tends to be much younger than this range suggests. Most commonly, individuals present in late adolescence or early adulthood (ages 20-30). The onset after age 40 years old would be considered atypical for ankylosing spondylitis.<br />",
