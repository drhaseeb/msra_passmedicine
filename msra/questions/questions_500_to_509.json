            "The correct answer is <b>Familial hypercholesterolaemia</b>. This patient presents with classical features of Familial Hypercholesterolaemia (FH), which is an autosomal dominant condition characterised by mutations in the LDL receptor gene, apolipoprotein B gene, or PCSK9 gene. The key diagnostic features here include a markedly elevated LDL cholesterol (>5 mmol/L), presence of tendon xanthomata (pathognomonic for FH), and a strong family history of premature cardiovascular disease (father's MI at age 45). According to NICE guidelines, these findings meet the Simon Broome criteria for definite FH.<br /><br /><b>Mixed hyperlipidaemia</b> is incorrect because although it can present with elevated cholesterol and triglycerides, it typically shows a more balanced elevation of both parameters. The presence of tendon xanthomata and the strong family history are not typical features of mixed hyperlipidaemia.<br /><br /><b>Nephrotic syndrome</b> is incorrect because although it can cause secondary hyperlipidaemia, it would be accompanied by other clinical features such as peripheral oedema, proteinuria, and hypoalbuminaemia. The family history and xanthomata would not be explained by nephrotic syndrome.<br /><br /><b>Alcohol excess</b> is incorrect because alcohol primarily affects triglyceride levels rather than LDL cholesterol.

Additionally, alcohol excess would not explain the tendon xanthomata or family history.<br /><br /><b>Non-familial hypercholesterolaemia</b> is incorrect because the presence of tendon xanthomata, very high LDL cholesterol, and strong family history of premature cardiovascular disease are classical features of familial rather than non-familial hypercholesterolaemia.

            "The clinical finding described is a right relative afferent pupillary defect (RAPD), also known as a Marcus Gunn pupil. This sign is crucial for localising a lesion within the visual pathway.<br /><br /><b>Optic nerve</b><br />The correct answer is the optic nerve. The swinging light test assesses the integrity of the afferent limb of the pupillary light reflex. This pathway involves the retina, the optic nerve, the optic chiasm, and the optic tract, before fibres diverge to the pretectal nucleus in the midbrain. In a normal response, when light is swung from one eye to the other, both pupils constrict or remain constricted. In this scenario, when light is moved from the healthy left eye to the diseased right eye, the afferent signal from the right optic nerve is weaker. The brainstem perceives this as a relative decrease in light, causing the efferent signal via both oculomotor nerves to weaken, resulting in paradoxical dilation of both pupils. This indicates a lesion in the afferent pathway anterior to the optic chiasm, most commonly affecting the optic nerve. Common causes include optic neuritis (as might be suspected in a young woman), ischaemic optic neuropathy, or compression from a tumour.<br /><br /><b>Optic chiasm</b><br />A lesion at the optic chiasm, such as a pituitary adenoma, classically causes a bitemporal hemianopia by compressing the decussating nasal fibres from both eyes. An RAPD is not a typical feature of a chiasmal lesion unless there is significant, asymmetrical compression that predominantly affects the optic nerve of one eye as it enters the chiasm. Even in such cases, the primary pathology is effectively an optic neuropathy at the chiasmal junction, making the optic nerve the more precise and common site for a unilateral RAPD.<br /><br /><b>Optic radiation</b><br />The optic radiations are part of the post-geniculate visual pathway, transmitting signals from the lateral geniculate nucleus (LGN) of the thalamus to the primary visual cortex. The afferent fibres responsible for the pupillary light reflex branch off from the main visual pathway before the LGN to synapse in the midbrain. Consequently, any lesion affecting the optic radiations (or any part of the pathway posterior to the LGN) will not cause an RAPD. Lesions here, for example from a stroke or tumour, typically result in a contralateral homonymous hemianopia, but pupillary light reflexes remain intact.<br /><br /><b>Oculomotor nerve</b><br />The oculomotor nerve (cranial nerve III) constitutes the efferent (motor) limb of the pupillary light reflex, carrying parasympathetic fibres that cause pupillary constriction. A lesion of the oculomotor nerve would cause an efferent pupillary defect. This would manifest as a poorly reactive, dilated pupil on the affected side (a 'surgical third'), regardless of which eye the light is shone into. The consensual response in the contralateral eye would remain intact. This is distinct from an RAPD, which is an afferent defect.<br /><br /><b>Visual cortex</b><br />Similar to the optic radiations, the visual cortex is located at the end of the visual pathway, posterior to the point where the pupillary reflex fibres diverge. A lesion in the visual cortex, for example from a posterior cerebral artery stroke, can cause a contralateral homonymous hemianopia, often with macular sparing. However, because the pupillary light reflex pathway is anatomically separate at this point, a lesion in the visual cortex does not cause an RAPD. The pupillary responses to light will be completely normal.",

            "The correct answer is co-amoxiclav. With a human bite, antibiotics should be offered if a bite has broken the skin and drawn blood. This is not the case with the man in the scenario, but he has been bitten in what NICE guidelines denote as a 'high-risk area'. High-risk areas include the hands, feet, face, genitals, skin overlying cartilaginous structures or an area of poor circulation. If a bite has broken the skin but not drawn blood, such as in this scenario, antibiotics should be considered if it is in a high-risk area or if the person is at high risk (immunosuppression, diabetes, asplenia or decompensated liver disease). The first choice antibiotic to be used in the prophylaxis and treatment of human and animal bites is co-amoxiclav.<br /><br />Doxycycline with metronidazole would be the antibiotic of choice if the patient had a penicillin allergy or if co-amoxiclav is unsuitable.<br /><br />Flucloxacillin does not play a role in the prophylaxis and treatment of human and animal bites.<br /><br />From NICE guidance, a swab taken for microbiological sampling is indicated if there is discharge (purulent or non-purulent) present from the wound site. Antibiotic choice can then be reviewed based on the swab results. This, however, is not the case in the scenario as there is no discharge present.<br /><br />Initial management of the wound site should include removing foreign bodies, irrigating the site, and debridement (especially if the wound is dirty), as well as analgesia for the management of pain. However, due to the location of the bite being in a high-risk area, antibiotics are also indicated.",

            "The correct answer is the <b>sternum</b>. Keloid scars are a result of an overgrowth of dense fibrous tissue that usually develops after the healing of a skin injury. The scar extends beyond the borders of the original wound, does not regress and tends to recur after excision. The sternum, along with other areas such as shoulders, upper arms and earlobes, is particularly prone to keloid formation due to high tension in these areas.<br /><br />The <b>lower back</b>, although it can develop keloid scars, is not as commonly affected as the sternum. This may be due to less tension in this area compared to the chest wall or less frequent injury.<br /><br />Keloids can also form on the <b>abdomen</b>, but they are not as common in this location as on the sternum. It's important to note that surgical incisions, such as those for abdominal surgeries, can lead to keloid formation if the individual has a predisposition.<br /><br />The <b>flexor surfaces of limbs</b> are less likely to form keloids compared to other parts of the body because these areas are usually covered by clothing and therefore protected from trauma. However, piercings or burns in these areas could potentially lead to keloid formation.<br /><br />Lastly, while it's possible for keloids to develop on the <b>scalp</b>, they're relatively rare in this location. This could be due to several factors including fewer injuries occurring on this part of the body or perhaps related to differences in hair follicle biology which may influence wound healing and scar formation.",

            "<b>Trichomonas vaginalis</b> is the correct answer. This sexually transmitted protozoal infection classically presents with an offensive yellow-green discharge and vulvovaginitis. The key diagnostic feature in this case is the appearance of the cervix with punctate haemorrhages, described as a 'strawberry cervix', which is pathognomonic for trichomoniasis. This finding occurs in approximately 2% of cases when viewed with the naked eye but up to 45% when viewed with colposcopy. The discharge is typically frothy and offensive, and the vaginal pH is elevated above 4.5. Diagnosis is confirmed by microscopy of a wet mount showing motile flagellated trophozoites, though nucleic acid amplification tests are increasingly used due to higher sensitivity. Treatment consists of oral metronidazole, either as a 5-7 day course or a single 2g dose. Sexual partners should be traced and treated, and patients should abstain from sexual intercourse until treatment is completed and partners are treated.<br /><br /><b>Bacterial vaginosis</b> presents with an offensive discharge, but this is typically thin, grey-white and homogenous rather than yellow-green. The characteristic fishy odour is often more pronounced than in trichomoniasis. The cervix appears normal on examination without the punctate haemorrhages described. Clue cells (epithelial cells studded with bacteria) are seen on microscopy rather than motile organisms. The vaginal pH is also elevated above 4.5, which can cause diagnostic confusion.<br /><br /><b>Candida albicans</b> typically causes a thick, white, cottage cheese-like discharge that is non-offensive. Patients usually experience intense pruritus and the discharge is not yellow-green. The vaginal pH remains normal (below 4.5) in candidiasis. The cervix would appear normal without the punctate haemorrhagic changes described in this scenario. Vulval erythema and satellite lesions may be present.<br /><br /><b>Chlamydia trachomatis</b> can cause mucopurulent cervical discharge and cervicitis, but the discharge is not typically described as offensive or yellow-green with the same characteristics. The cervix may appear inflamed and friable with contact bleeding, but the distinctive strawberry appearance with punctate haemorrhages is not a feature. Many women with chlamydia are asymptomatic. Diagnosis requires nucleic acid amplification testing.<br /><br /><b>Neisseria gonorrhoeae</b> causes a purulent discharge that may be yellow but is not typically described as offensive in the same way as trichomoniasis. The cervix may show mucopurulent discharge and inflammation but not the characteristic strawberry appearance. Gonorrhoea often coexists with chlamydia and may cause more acute symptoms.

            "The correct answer is <b>TSH</b>. Thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) is the single most important blood test to assess a patient's response to treatment with levothyroxine for Hashimoto's thyroiditis. In this autoimmune condition, the thyroid gland is gradually destroyed, leading to hypothyroidism. Levothyroxine, a synthetic form of thyroxine (T4), is used as replacement therapy. The goal of treatment is to maintain TSH within the reference range, which indicates that the patient has an adequate amount of thyroid hormone.<br /><br />The other options are not as useful in assessing the response to treatment:<br /><br /><b>ESR</b> (erythrocyte sedimentation rate) is a non-specific marker of inflammation and can be elevated in various conditions, including autoimmune diseases like Hashimoto's thyroiditis. However, it does not provide information about thyroid function or the adequacy of levothyroxine therapy.<br /><br /><b>Free T4</b> (free thyroxine) measures the unbound fraction of T4 in the blood and may be helpful in diagnosing hypothyroidism when used alongside TSH. However, for monitoring purposes, TSH alone is considered sufficient in most cases because it provides a more sensitive indicator of inadequate or excessive levothyroxine dosing.<br /><br /><b>Total T4</b> measures both bound and unbound fractions of thyroxine in the blood. It can be influenced by changes in binding proteins such as albumin and thyroxine-binding globulin (TBG), making it less reliable than free T4 for assessing thyroid function.<br /><br /><b>Free T3</b> (free triiodothyronine) measures the unbound fraction of T3 in the blood. While it might be relevant in some specific situations such as suspected peripheral conversion issues or triiodothyronine (T3)-treated patients, it is not necessary for routine monitoring of levothyroxine therapy in patients with primary hypothyroidism due to Hashimoto's thyroiditis.",
