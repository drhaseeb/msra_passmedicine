Molar pregnancies are characterised by significantly high levels of beta hCG for gestational age, and are therefore used as a tumour marker of gestational trophoblastic disease. The biochemical structure of beta hCG is very similar to that of luteinizing hormone (LH), follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH), and thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH). That being said, high levels of beta hCG can stimulate the thyroid gland to produce thyroxine (T4), and then triiodothyronine (T3).  This can result in signs and symptoms of thyrotoxicosis.

            "<b>Pharyngeal pouch</b> is the most likely diagnosis. This patient's presentation is a classic textbook case of a pharyngeal pouch, also known as Zenker's diverticulum. This is an outpouching of the pharyngeal mucosa through a natural area of weakness in the posterior pharyngeal wall called Killian's dehiscence, located between the thyropharyngeus and cricopharyngeus muscles. It typically occurs in older men. The 6-month history of dysphagia is characteristic, often described as a sensation of food sticking high in the throat. The regurgitation of <i>undigested</i> food is a key feature, as food becomes trapped in the pouch and is brought back up, sometimes hours after eating, without having reached the stomach. This stagnant, decomposing food within the pouch is also the cause of the halitosis (unpleasant breath) mentioned by his wife. The coughing after meals suggests aspiration of the pouch contents into the airway, a serious potential complication leading to recurrent chest infections. Finally, the soft swelling in the left side of his neck is the pouch itself, which can often be seen or palpated, and may characteristically gurgle on palpation (Garguille's sign). The combination of all these specific features makes a pharyngeal pouch the most compelling diagnosis.<br /><br /><b>Oesophageal carcinoma</b> is an important differential for dysphagia in an elderly patient, but it is less likely here. While it causes dysphagia, the pattern is typically progressive, starting with solids and advancing to liquids, and is often associated with significant constitutional symptoms like weight loss, which are not mentioned in this case. Regurgitation can occur, but it is usually of food that has travelled further down the oesophagus. A neck swelling can be present in advanced oesophageal cancer, but this would represent metastatic spread to cervical lymph nodes, which would typically feel hard, irregular, and fixed, rather than the soft swelling described. The combination of halitosis and regurgitation of undigested food specifically points more towards a pouch where food stagnates, rather than a malignant stricture causing obstruction.<br /><br /><b>Thyroid goitre</b> can cause a neck swelling and dysphagia. A large or retrosternal goitre can compress the pharynx or oesophagus, leading to difficulty swallowing. However, a goitre would not explain the other key symptoms in this presentation. It does not provide a mechanism for the regurgitation of undigested food or the development of halitosis, as there is no pouch for food to collect and stagnate in. Furthermore, the coughing after meals (suggesting aspiration) is not a typical feature of a simple compressive goitre. On examination, a thyroid swelling is typically located more anteriorly in the neck and classically moves upwards when the patient swallows, a feature not described here. The swelling described as 'soft' is also more in keeping with a fluid and food-filled pouch than a solid or cystic goitre.<br /><br /><b>Achalasia</b> is a primary oesophageal motility disorder characterised by the failure of the lower oesophageal sphincter (LES) to relax and the absence of peristalsis in the oesophageal body. This leads to dysphagia for both solids and liquids from the outset, and patients often regurgitate large volumes of undigested or partially digested food. While it shares the symptoms of dysphagia and regurgitation with this case, the underlying pathology is at the gastro-oesophageal junction, far from the neck. Therefore, achalasia does not cause a palpable neck swelling. The patient's symptoms are localised to the pharyngeal phase of swallowing, making a pathology in the distal oesophagus, such as achalasia, much less likely.<br /><br /><b>Laryngeal carcinoma</b> is a plausible but less likely diagnosis. A tumour of the larynx, particularly a supraglottic one, can cause dysphagia and may present with a neck mass due to metastatic spread to cervical lymph nodes. This would be an important consideration in a patient of this age. However, the clinical picture does not fit as well as it does for a pharyngeal pouch. A key symptom of laryngeal cancer, which is absent here, is hoarseness or a change in voice. While aspiration and coughing can occur, the specific history of regurgitating stale, undigested food and the associated halitosis are not typical features. Furthermore, a metastatic cervical lymph node would be expected to be hard and firm on palpation, in contrast to the 'soft' swelling described, which is much more characteristic of a food-filled diverticulum.",

Under normal circumstances, this would be useful in the role of MI management. However, a lot of controversy surrounds their use in cocaine-related MI, as they may exacerbate coronary vasospasm. Of the options above, diazepam is a more appropriate choice.<br /><br /><b>Naloxone</b> is used to reverse the effects of opioid overdose, which would include respiratory depression and pinpoint pupils. This patient does not display any of these signs and so this would be inappropriate. He is intoxicated with cocaine, not with opioids.<br /><br /><b>Ramipril</b> is an ACE inhibitor. While part of long-term management following MIs, ACE inhibitors are not routinely given acutely.",

The vast majority of cases are caused by dog bites but it may also be transmitted by bat, raccoon and skunk bites. <br /><br />After entry, the virus replicates in muscle tissue near the site of the bite before entering the peripheral nervous system. It then travels up to the central nervous system, where it causes encephalitis, leading to severe neurological symptoms. The virus eventually reaches the salivary glands, facilitating transmission.<br /><br />Rabies is estimated to still kill around 25,000-50,000 people across the world each year. The vast majority of the disease burden falls on people in poor rural areas of Africa and Asia.
