            "<b> Osteoporosis </b> is the correct answer. This woman has a suppressed TSH due to the levothyroxine dose being too high. If this is not corrected there is a risk of osteoporosis developing as excessive thyroid hormone levels increase osteoclast activity, leading to greater bone resorption and loss of bone mass. If doses are being adjusted it is important to monitor the thyroid function via blood tests to prevent complications. In this case, this woman's levothyroxine dose will need to be reduced in order to prevent this increased risk of osteoporosis.<br /><br /><b> Conn's syndrome </b> is incorrect. Conn's syndrome, or primary hyperaldosteronism, is characterized by excessive aldosterone production from the adrenal glands, leading to sodium retention, potassium loss, and high blood pressure.<br /><br /><b> Graves' disease </b> is incorrect. Graves' disease is an autoimmune thyroid disorder characterized by the overproduction of thyroid hormones due to stimulation of the thyroid gland by thyroid-stimulating antibodies, leading to hyperthyroidism. In this case, the blood test results are due to over-replacement of levothyroxine.<br /><br /><b> Hypoparathyroidism </b> is incorrect. Over-replacement of thyroxine is not directly linked to hypoparathyroidism. However, excessive thyroxine can cause increased bone turnover and disturbances in calcium metabolism, which may indirectly influence parathyroid hormone regulation.<br /><br /><b> Osteoarthritis </b> is incorrect. There is no direct, well-established link between over-replacement of thyroxine and osteoarthritis.",

        "correct_answer": "5",
        "question_notes": "<b> Osteoporosis </b> is the correct answer. This woman has a suppressed TSH due to the levothyroxine dose being too high. If this is not corrected there is a risk of osteoporosis developing as excessive thyroid hormone levels increase osteoclast activity, leading to greater bone resorption and loss of bone mass. If doses are being adjusted it is important to monitor the thyroid function via blood tests to prevent complications. In this case, this woman's levothyroxine dose will need to be reduced in order to prevent this increased risk of osteoporosis.<br /><br /><b> Conn's syndrome </b> is incorrect. Conn's syndrome, or primary hyperaldosteronism, is characterized by excessive aldosterone production from the adrenal glands, leading to sodium retention, potassium loss, and high blood pressure.<br /><br /><b> Graves' disease </b> is incorrect. Graves' disease is an autoimmune thyroid disorder characterized by the overproduction of thyroid hormones due to stimulation of the thyroid gland by thyroid-stimulating antibodies, leading to hyperthyroidism. In this case, the blood test results are due to over-replacement of levothyroxine.<br /><br /><b> Hypoparathyroidism </b> is incorrect. Over-replacement of thyroxine is not directly linked to hypoparathyroidism. However, excessive thyroxine can cause increased bone turnover and disturbances in calcium metabolism, which may indirectly influence parathyroid hormone regulation.<br /><br /><b> Osteoarthritis </b> is incorrect. There is no direct, well-established link between over-replacement of thyroxine and osteoarthritis.",

            "The correct answer is <b>Dry skin</b>. Isotretinoin, a retinoid, is commonly used for the treatment of severe acne. It works by reducing sebum production, which in turn reduces inflammation and comedone formation. The most common side effect of isotretinoin is dry skin, which occurs due to its effect on sebaceous glands leading to reduced oil production. This can affect all areas of the skin including the lips and eyes.<br /><br /><b>Low mood</b> is not the most likely side effect but it has been reported in some patients taking isotretinoin. However, it's worth mentioning that acne itself can be associated with low mood and depression due to its impact on self-image and quality of life. Therefore, it can be difficult to establish a direct causal relationship between isotretinoin use and mood changes.<br /><br /><b>Thrombocytopaenia</b>, or low platelet count, is not typically associated with isotretinoin use. While isotretinoin can have an impact on blood cells, it more commonly causes a rise in erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) and haemoglobin concentration.<br /><br /><b>Raised plasma triglycerides</b> can occur as a result of isotretinoin therapy but this is relatively uncommon compared to dry skin. Patients starting on isotretinoin should have baseline lipid levels checked before treatment initiation and monitored throughout treatment as per UK guidelines.<br /><br />Finally, <b>Reversible alopecia</b>, although possible with isotretinoin use, is extremely rare compared to the other options listed above. In fact hair thinning or hair loss are more often reported with prolonged high-dose therapy or following discontinuation of the drug rather than during standard treatment courses for acne.<br />",

            "The correct answer is the <b>Ulnar nerve</b>. The ulnar nerve innervates the hypothenar muscles, which are responsible for movements of the little finger. Sensory loss in the little finger is also a characteristic feature of ulnar nerve lesion. This patient's symptoms - sensory loss to the little finger and wasting of the hypothenar eminence - are classic presentations of an ulnar nerve lesion.<br /><br />The <b>Common peroneal nerve</b> is incorrect because it is a peripheral nerve in the lower limb, not in the upper limb. It provides motor and sensory supply to parts of the lower leg and foot but has no role in hand or finger function.<br /><br />The <b>Median nerve</b> is also incorrect. While it does provide motor and sensory innervation to most of the anterior forearm and three-and-a-half fingers (thumb, index, middle, and half of ring finger), it does not innervate the little finger or hypothenar eminence.<br /><br />The <b>Radial nerve</b> option is incorrect as well. The radial nerve primarily supplies the dorsal aspect of our arm and forearm. It doesn't supply any part of our hand's palmar aspect where our hypothenar eminence lies.<br /><br />Lastly, the <b>Anterior interosseous nerve</b>, a branch of median nerve, innervates deep muscles in the anterior compartment of forearm but does not have any cutaneous distribution in hand or fingers making this option incorrect as well.",
