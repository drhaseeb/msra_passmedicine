            "This scenario describes a 25-year-old woman who has developed a resting tremor and increased upper limb tone after starting medication for hyperemesis gravidarum. Resting tremor can be part of extrapyramidal effects seen with <b>metoclopramide</b>, particularly when used for longer periods. Due to the risk of extrapyramidal effects, it is recommended that metoclopramide should not be used first-line.

Cyclizine is a H1 histamine receptor antagonist, which may be used in hyperemesis gravidarum.

        "body": "Whilst the majority of women experience nausea (previously termed 'morning sickness') during the early stages of pregnancy it can become problematic in a minority of cases.

        "question": "A 44-year-old woman presents with increasing lethargy and cough. She puts it down to the stress she was under at a recent conference in Spain. Since then she has felt feverish and lethargic with a cough starting two days ago. She has no past medical history but admits to recent unprotected sexual intercourse. Chest x-ray shows bi-basal consolidation. Blood tests are as follows: <br /><br /><div class=\"table-responsive\"><table class = \"tb\" ><tbody><tr><td>White cell count</td><td>12 * 10^9/l</td></tr><tr><td>Haemoglobin</td><td>135 g/l</td></tr><tr><td>CRP</td><td>145 mg/l</td></tr><tr><td>Sodium</td><td>125 mmol/l</td></tr><tr><td>Potassium</td><td>4.7 mmol/l</td></tr><tr><td>Alanine Transaminase</td><td>87 IU/l</td></tr></tbody></table></div><br />What organism is responsible?",

        "question_notes": "<i>Legionella</i> pneumonia often occurs in outbreaks centred around a communal water supply. This is alluded to in this question by the recent conference in Spain.  It also frequently leads to bi-basal pneumonia as demonstrated in the question. <br /><br />In addition, <i>Legionella</i> often causes a hyponatraemia and deranged liver function tests. This is shown in this question. Hyponatraemia can often lead to the patients presenting confused, but this is not mentioned in this particular question. <br /><br />The unprotected sex is a distractor. If the patient had got HIV it would take years before they would be susceptible to infections such a TB and <i>Pneumocystis jiroveci</i>.",

This is a type of hypersensitivity reaction that presents as a rash with target-like lesions or 'bull's-eye' appearances. It often occurs following certain infections, including HSV.<br /><br /><b>Erythema ab igne</b> is incorrect because it is a skin condition caused by long-term exposure to heat or infrared radiation, not related to an infection like HSV. It presents as a mottled, red-brownish discolouration of the skin and does not develop after herpes simplex infections.<br /><br /><b>Erythema nodosum</b> is also incorrect. Erythema nodosum is an inflammatory condition that causes tender, red nodules under the skin, typically on the shins. Although it can occur in response to various triggers such as infections, drugs and diseases like sarcoidosis and inflammatory bowel disease, it isn't usually associated with herpes simplex infections.<br /><br />The option <b>Erythema chronicum migrans</b> isn't correct either. This rash is characteristic of Lyme disease, which is caused by the bacterium <i>Borrelia burgdorferi</i>, transmitted through tick bites. It typically starts as a small red spot at the site of the tick bite and expands over time to form a large round rash.<br /><br />Finally, <b>Erythema marginatum</b> is incorrect because this rash is most commonly associated with rheumatic fever - an inflammatory disease that can develop after an infection with group A Streptococcus bacteria causing strep throat or scarlet fever - not with primary herpes simplex infection. The rash appears as pink rings on the torso and inner surfaces of the limbs which come and go for as long as several months.<br />",

            "<b>Intravenous benzodiazepines</b> are the correct initial pharmacological treatment in this case of cocaine-induced myocardial infarction. Cocaine causes coronary artery vasospasm through alpha-adrenergic stimulation, alongside increased myocardial oxygen demand from sympathetic activation. Benzodiazepines are first-line for most cocaine-related cardiovascular complications because they reduce sympathetic drive, decrease heart rate and blood pressure, and may help relieve coronary vasospasm. They also address the patient's likely agitation and anxiety, which further exacerbates the cardiovascular stress. Following benzodiazepine administration, glyceryl trinitrate should be given for ongoing chest pain, and the patient should proceed to primary percutaneous coronary intervention for the STEMI. This approach follows guidance that benzodiazepines should be the initial pharmacological intervention in cocaine-associated acute coronary syndrome, before other standard ACS treatments are layered on top.<br /><br /><b>Intravenous beta-blockers</b> are contraindicated in cocaine-induced myocardial infarction. The American Heart Association has warned against their use due to the risk of unopposed alpha-adrenergic stimulation, which can worsen coronary vasospasm and potentially increase infarct size. Beta-blockade removes the protective beta-2 mediated vasodilation, leaving alpha-mediated vasoconstriction unopposed. This can paradoxically worsen hypertension and coronary ischaemia. While some cardiologists have questioned the strength of evidence for this contraindication, safer alternatives exist and should be used first-line.<br /><br /><b>Intravenous calcium channel blockers</b> might theoretically help with coronary vasospasm, but they are not the recommended first-line treatment for cocaine-induced ACS. Benzodiazepines are preferred because they address the underlying sympathetic overactivity more comprehensively. Calcium channel blockers may have a role if vasospasm persists despite benzodiazepines and nitrates, but they should not be the initial choice. Additionally, some calcium channel blockers (particularly verapamil and diltiazem) can cause significant hypotension or bradycardia, which may complicate management.<br /><br /><b>Oral aspirin</b> is an important part of standard STEMI management and should be given in cocaine-induced myocardial infarction. However, it is not the most appropriate initial treatment in this specific scenario. The question asks for the initial pharmacological treatment that addresses the unique pathophysiology of cocaine-induced ACS. Benzodiazepines should be given first to reduce sympathetic drive and coronary vasospasm, after which standard ACS treatments including aspirin should follow. Aspirin alone does not address the vasospasm or sympathetic overactivity that characterises cocaine toxicity.<br /><br /><b>Intravenous morphine</b> is commonly used for analgesia in acute coronary syndromes and may provide some sympathetic reduction. However, it is not the most appropriate initial treatment for cocaine-induced MI. Benzodiazepines are superior because they more effectively reduce the sympathetic overactivity and agitation associated with cocaine use, and they have a better safety profile in this context. Morphine may also cause histamine release leading to vasodilation and hypotension, which could be problematic. Furthermore, recent evidence has questioned the routine use of morphine in ACS due to potential adverse effects on antiplatelet agent absorption.",
