            "The correct answer is antiphospholipid syndrome (APS), which is the most common treatable cause of recurrent first trimester miscarriage. APS is an acquired autoimmune condition characterised by the presence of antiphospholipid antibodies that target phospholipid-binding proteins. These antibodies can cause both arterial and venous thrombosis, and in pregnancy, they can lead to placental insufficiency and subsequent miscarriage. The diagnosis requires both clinical criteria (including three or more consecutive first trimester losses) and laboratory criteria (persistent presence of lupus anticoagulant, anticardiolipin, or anti-\u03b22 glycoprotein-I antibodies).<br /><br /><b>Factor V Leiden gene mutation</b> is indeed associated with recurrent miscarriage, but it is less common than APS. This inherited thrombophilia causes activated protein C resistance, increasing thrombotic risk, but studies suggest it plays a more significant role in late pregnancy complications rather than first trimester losses.<br /><br /><b>Polycystic ovarian syndrome (PCOS)</b> can cause fertility problems and may be associated with an increased risk of miscarriage, but it is not the most common cause of recurrent first trimester loss. The relationship between PCOS and recurrent miscarriage is still debated, with some studies suggesting the association may be related to obesity and insulin resistance rather than PCOS itself.<br /><br /><b>Hyperprolactinaemia</b> can interfere with normal ovulation and fertility, but it is not a major cause of recurrent first trimester miscarriage. While elevated prolactin levels can impact fertility by interfering with GnRH pulsatility and ovulation, once pregnancy is established, hyperprolactinaemia rarely causes recurrent losses.<br /><br /><b>Antithrombin III deficiency</b> is a rare inherited thrombophilia that can cause pregnancy complications, but it is much less common than APS. While it can lead to increased thrombotic risk and pregnancy complications, its rarity makes it an unlikely cause of recurrent first trimester miscarriage in most cases.",

            "<b>Prescribe artificial tears and advise eye taping at night</b> is the most important next step in management for this patient with Bell's palsy. In Bell's palsy, the facial nerve weakness affects the orbicularis oculi muscle, which is responsible for eye closure. This can lead to incomplete eye closure (lagophthalmos) and reduced blink reflex, putting the patient at significant risk of exposure keratopathy, corneal abrasions, and potentially serious ocular complications. Artificial tears provide lubrication during the day, while taping the eye closed at night prevents nocturnal exposure when the patient cannot consciously blink. This eye protection is crucial and should be implemented immediately, even before considering other management options. The prednisolone already prescribed addresses the inflammation of the facial nerve, but without proper eye care, the patient could suffer permanent visual impairment regardless of how well the facial palsy resolves.<br /><br /><b>Refer for neuroimaging</b> is not the most important next step for this patient. Neuroimaging is typically reserved for atypical presentations of facial palsy, such as gradual onset, involvement of other cranial nerves, or when there are other neurological symptoms suggesting a central cause. This patient has a classic presentation of Bell's palsy with sudden onset, isolated lower motor neuron facial weakness, and no other neurological features. While imaging may be considered if the patient fails to improve after several weeks, it is not the immediate priority compared to eye protection.<br /><br /><b>Prescribe aciclovir</b> is not the most important next step. While there is some evidence suggesting herpes simplex virus may play a role in the aetiology of Bell's palsy, the benefit of antiviral treatment remains controversial. Current UK guidelines suggest that antivirals alone are not recommended, and even combination therapy with steroids has limited evidence of additional benefit over steroids alone, particularly in mild to moderate cases. The patient has already been prescribed prednisolone, which is the mainstay of treatment, and eye protection takes precedence over adding an antiviral agent.<br /><br /><b>Do a HIV test</b> is not the most important next step. Although HIV can be associated with facial nerve palsy, routine HIV testing is not recommended for all cases of Bell's palsy. Testing would be more appropriate if there were risk factors for HIV infection, multiple cranial nerve palsies, or other features suggesting immunocompromise. In this case of typical Bell's palsy in an otherwise healthy 39-year-old woman, eye protection is a more urgent priority than HIV testing.<br /><br /><b>Arrange ENT follow-up in 2 weeks</b> is not the most important next step. While follow-up is important in Bell's palsy management, current guidelines suggest that urgent referral to ENT is only necessary if there is no improvement after 3 weeks of treatment. At this early stage, the priority is to start appropriate treatment (prednisolone has been given) and protect the eye from complications. A routine follow-up can be arranged in primary care initially, with specialist referral reserved for cases that fail to show improvement or have atypical features. Eye protection cannot wait for a specialist appointment and must be implemented immediately.",

This condition is associated with an early diastolic murmur. <br /><br /><b> Ejection systolic </b> is incorrect. This type of murmur is associated with aortic stenosis rather than regurgitation. Other signs of this condition might be a narrow pulse pressure and a slow rising pulse. <br /><br /><b> Late diastolic </b> is incorrect.  This type of murmur is heard with mitral stenosis, tricuspid stenosis, myxoma, and complete heart block. <br /><br /><b> Late systolic </b> is incorrect.
