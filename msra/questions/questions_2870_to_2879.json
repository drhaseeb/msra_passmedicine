            "<b>Vaginal prostaglandin E\u2082</b> is the correct answer. The first step in this scenario is to calculate the Bishop score to assess cervical favourability. The score is calculated as follows: Posterior position (0), firm consistency (0), 30% effacement (0), 1cm dilation (1), and -3 station (0), giving a total Bishop score of 1. A score of \u2264 6 indicates an 'unripe' or 'unfavourable' cervix. According to UK NICE guidelines (NG207), for women with an unfavourable cervix, induction of labour should be initiated with a method aimed at cervical ripening. The recommended first-line pharmacological method is vaginal prostaglandin E\u2082 (dinoprostone). This helps to soften, efface, and dilate the cervix, increasing the likelihood of a successful induction and vaginal delivery. Oral misoprostol (prostaglandin E\u2081) is an alternative pharmacological option.<br /><br /><b>Amniotomy and oxytocin infusion</b> is incorrect. This method, often referred to as ARM (artificial rupture of membranes) and syntocinon, is the standard management for inducing labour in women with a favourable cervix (Bishop score > 6). Attempting an amniotomy with a posterior, firm, minimally dilated cervix would be technically difficult, uncomfortable for the patient, and associated with a higher risk of failure and complications such as cord prolapse. An oxytocin infusion alone would be ineffective on an unripe cervix.<br /><br /><b>Cervical ripening balloon</b> is a plausible but incorrect choice as the first-line option in this specific case. This is a mechanical method of cervical ripening and is a suitable alternative to prostaglandins. NICE guidelines recommend considering a cervical ripening balloon for women who have contraindications to prostaglandins, such as a high risk of uterine hyperstimulation or a history of a previous caesarean section. In this low-risk primigravida with no stated contraindications, pharmacological ripening with prostaglandins is the preferred first-line approach.<br /><br /><b>Intravenous oxytocin infusion</b> alone is incorrect. Oxytocin is effective at stimulating uterine contractions but has a minimal effect on cervical ripening. Administering oxytocin to a patient with a very unfavourable cervix (Bishop score of 1) is unlikely to result in progressive labour and carries a significant risk of uterine hyperstimulation, which can lead to fetal distress without achieving cervical dilation. It is typically used after the cervix has become favourable, often following an amniotomy.<br /><br /><b>Membrane sweep</b> is incorrect at this stage. A membrane sweep is a procedure offered to women approaching or at term (e.g., at 40 and 41-week antenatal appointments for nulliparous women) to reduce the need for formal induction of labour. As this patient is now 41+5 weeks and is presenting for a formal induction of labour due to prolonged pregnancy, a more definitive method is required. While a sweep could be performed, the primary management for an unfavourable cervix at this gestation is formal induction with cervical ripening agents.",

        "title": "Impetigo",
        "body": "Impetigo is a superficial bacterial skin infection usually caused by either <i>Staphylcoccus aureus</i> or <i>Streptococcus pyogenes</i>. It can be a primary infection or a complication of an existing skin condition such as eczema (in this case), scabies or insect bites. Impetigo is common in children, particularly during warm weather.<br /><br />The infection can develop anywhere on the body but lesions tend to occur on the face, flexures and limbs not covered by clothing.<br /><br />Spread is by direct contact with discharges from the scabs of an infected person. The bacteria invade the skin through minor abrasions and then spread to other sites by scratching. Infection is spread mainly by the hands, but indirect spread via toys, clothing, equipment and the environment may occur. The incubation period is between 4 to 10 days.<br /><br /><span class=\"concept\" data-cid=\"11706\">Features</span><br /><ul><li>'golden', crusted skin lesions typically found around the mouth</li><li>very contagious</li></ul><br /><div class=\"container\"><div class=\"row\"><div class=\"col-md-3\"><a href=\"https://d32xxyeh8kfs8k.cloudfront.net/images_Passmedicine/ddd108b.jpg\" data-fancybox=\"gallery\" data-caption=\"Impetigo\"><img  class=\"img-thumbnail mx-auto d-block\" style=\"max-height:150px;margin-bottom:10px;\" src=\"https://d32xxyeh8kfs8k.cloudfront.net/images_Passmedicine/ddd108.jpg\" alt=\"\" /></a></div><div class=\"col-md-3\"><a href=\"https://d32xxyeh8kfs8k.cloudfront.net/images_Passmedicine/ddd109b.jpg\" data-fancybox=\"gallery\" data-caption=\"Impetigo\"><img  class=\"img-thumbnail mx-auto d-block\" style=\"max-height:150px;margin-bottom:10px;\" src=\"https://d32xxyeh8kfs8k.cloudfront.net/images_Passmedicine/ddd109.jpg\" alt=\"\" /></a></div><div class=\"col-md-3\"><a href=\"https://d32xxyeh8kfs8k.cloudfront.net/images_Passmedicine/pdd993b.jpg\" data-fancybox=\"gallery\" data-caption=\"Impetigo - note the typical golden crusted lesions on the chin\"><img  class=\"img-thumbnail mx-auto d-block\" style=\"max-height:150px;margin-bottom:10px;\" src=\"https://d32xxyeh8kfs8k.cloudfront.net/images_Passmedicine/pdd993.jpg\" alt=\"\" /></a></div></div></div><br /><h5 class='notes-heading'>Management</h5><br />Limited, localised disease<br /><ul><li>NICE now recommend <b><span class=\"concept\" data-cid=\"10957\">hydrogen peroxide 1% cream</span></b> for 'people who are not systemically unwell or at a high risk of complications' <ul><li>the change was announced in 2020 by NICE and Public Health England and seems aimed at cutting antibiotic resistance</li><li>the evidence base shows it is just as effective at treating non-bullous impetigo as a topical antibiotic</li></ul></li><li>topical antibiotic creams:<ul><li><span class=\"concept\" data-cid=\"325\">topical fusidic acid</span></li><li>topical mupirocin should be used if fusidic acid resistance is suspected</li><li>MRSA is not susceptible to either fusidic acid or retapamulin.
