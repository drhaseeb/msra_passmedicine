            "The correct answer is <b>Progesterone only injectable contraception</b>. This method, typically depot medroxyprogesterone acetate (DMPA), is known to cause a significant delay in return to fertility after discontinuation. The median time to conception after stopping DMPA is 10 months, but it can take up to 18 months or occasionally longer. This delay occurs because the depot injection maintains therapeutic drug levels for an extended period, and the hypothalamic-pituitary-ovarian axis takes time to resume normal function.<br /><br /><b>Progesterone only contraceptive implant</b> is incorrect because fertility returns rapidly after removal. Most women ovulate within three weeks of implant removal, and there is no evidence of long-term effects on fertility.<br /><br /><b>Intrauterine system (IUS)</b> is incorrect because fertility returns quickly after removal. The local action of the levonorgestrel-releasing IUS means that once removed, there is minimal systemic effect, and normal fertility resumes promptly.<br /><br /><b>Combined oral contraceptive pill (COCP)</b> is incorrect because although there may be a brief delay in conception after discontinuation, studies show that within 12 months of stopping, pregnancy rates are similar to those in women who have not used hormonal contraception.<br /><br /><b>Progesterone only pill (POP)</b> is incorrect because it has a very short half-life, and fertility returns rapidly after discontinuation. Most women resume ovulation within days of stopping the POP, making it unsuitable for this patient who wants to avoid any significant delay in return to fertility.<br /><br />For this patient who wants to conceive within 1-2 years, any method except the injectable contraception would be suitable, with counselling about prompt removal or discontinuation when she wishes to conceive.",

The local action of the levonorgestrel-releasing IUS means that once removed, there is minimal systemic effect, and normal fertility resumes promptly.<br /><br /><b>Combined oral contraceptive pill (COCP)</b> is incorrect because although there may be a brief delay in conception after discontinuation, studies show that within 12 months of stopping, pregnancy rates are similar to those in women who have not used hormonal contraception.<br /><br /><b>Progesterone only pill (POP)</b> is incorrect because it has a very short half-life, and fertility returns rapidly after discontinuation. Most women resume ovulation within days of stopping the POP, making it unsuitable for this patient who wants to avoid any significant delay in return to fertility.<br /><br />For this patient who wants to conceive within 1-2 years, any method except the injectable contraception would be suitable, with counselling about prompt removal or discontinuation when she wishes to conceive.",

            "<b>Immunofluorescence of nasopharyngeal secretions</b> is the most appropriate investigation in this case. The clinical presentation is highly suggestive of bronchiolitis, with the classic features of a preceding coryzal illness, followed by respiratory distress, feeding difficulties, tachypnoea, and auscultatory findings of crackles and wheeze in a 4-month-old infant. Respiratory Syncytial Virus (RSV) is the causative agent in 75-80% of bronchiolitis cases, particularly during winter months. Immunofluorescence testing of nasopharyngeal secretions is a rapid diagnostic test that can detect RSV antigen with good sensitivity and specificity. This allows for prompt diagnosis, appropriate isolation measures to prevent nosocomial spread, and helps guide clinical management. While the management of bronchiolitis is largely supportive regardless of the causative agent, confirming RSV infection can be valuable for prognostic information, epidemiological purposes, and to avoid unnecessary antibiotic use.<br /><br /><b>Blood culture</b> would not be the first-line investigation for suspected bronchiolitis. While secondary bacterial infections can occur in bronchiolitis, they are relatively uncommon. Blood cultures have a low yield in typical bronchiolitis cases and are generally reserved for infants with severe disease, those who appear toxic, or those with concerning features suggesting bacterial co-infection. This infant has a presentation consistent with uncomplicated viral bronchiolitis, making blood culture less appropriate as the initial diagnostic test.<br /><br /><b>Chest X-ray</b> is not routinely recommended in the investigation of bronchiolitis according to NICE guidelines. In a typical presentation of bronchiolitis, as in this case, chest X-rays often show non-specific findings such as hyperinflation, peribronchial thickening, and patchy atelectasis, which do not alter management. Unnecessary chest X-rays may lead to inappropriate antibiotic use due to misinterpretation of normal viral changes as bacterial pneumonia. Chest X-rays should be reserved for cases where there is diagnostic uncertainty or concerns about alternative diagnoses.<br /><br /><b>Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) for influenza</b> would not be the most appropriate first-line test in this scenario. While influenza can cause respiratory symptoms in infants, the clinical presentation described is much more consistent with RSV bronchiolitis. Influenza typically presents with more prominent systemic symptoms such as high fever and myalgia, although these can be less obvious in young infants. During bronchiolitis season, testing for RSV would take priority over influenza testing, particularly with the classic bronchiolitis presentation described.<br /><br /><b>Serum IgE levels</b> are not indicated in the acute management of bronchiolitis. Elevated IgE levels are associated with atopic conditions such as asthma and allergic rhinitis, but bronchiolitis is an acute viral infection of the lower respiratory tract. While some infants with bronchiolitis may later develop recurrent wheeze or asthma, measuring IgE levels during the acute illness does not aid in diagnosis or management of bronchiolitis and would not help identify the causative agent.",

Examples include spironolactone and eplerenone</li><li>it should be remembered that both ACE inhibitors (which the patient is likely to already be on) and aldosterone antagonists both cause hyperkalaemia - therefore potassium should be monitored </li></ul><br />There is an increasing role for <span class=\"concept\" data-cid=\"11988\"><b>SGLT-2 inhibitors</b></span> in the management of heart failure with a reduced ejection fraction<br /><ul><li>these drugs reduce glucose reabsorption and increase urinary glucose excretion</li><li>examples include canagliflozin, dapagliflozin and empagliflozin</li><li>the evidence base shows  SGLT-2 inhibitors reduced hospitalisation secondary to heart failure and cardiovascular death</li><li>international guidelines widely recommend their usage.

            "The correct answer is <b>Pioglitazone</b> because it is contraindicated in patients with heart failure. Pioglitazone is a thiazolidinedione, which works by increasing insulin sensitivity in peripheral tissues and decreasing hepatic gluconeogenesis. However, it can cause fluid retention and exacerbate heart failure, making it unsuitable for patients with pre-existing heart failure.<br /><br /><b>Metformin</b> is not contraindicated in this patient. It is the first-line treatment for type 2 diabetes mellitus according to UK guidelines and has been shown to reduce cardiovascular events. Although there was previously concern about using metformin in heart failure due to the risk of lactic acidosis, current evidence suggests that metformin can be safely used in patients with stable heart failure (NYHA class I-II) and normal or mildly impaired renal function.<br /><br /><b>Glipizide</b> is a sulfonylurea that stimulates insulin secretion from pancreatic beta cells. It can be used as an add-on therapy when metformin alone does not provide adequate glycaemic control. Sulfonylureas have been associated with an increased risk of cardiovascular events compared to other antidiabetic medications, but they are not contraindicated in patients with heart failure.<br /><br /><b>Exenatide</b> is a glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) receptor agonist that increases insulin secretion, decreases glucagon secretion, and slows gastric emptying. It has been shown to improve glycaemic control and promote weight loss, which could be beneficial for this patient. Exenatide is not contraindicated in patients with heart failure; however, its use should be carefully considered as there are limited data on its safety profile in this population.<br /><br /><b>Acarbose</b> is an alpha-glucosidase inhibitor that delays the absorption of carbohydrates in the small intestine, resulting in a reduced postprandial glucose rise. It can be used as an add-on therapy for patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus who are not adequately controlled with other medications. Acarbose is not contraindicated in patients with heart failure, but its use may be limited by gastrointestinal side effects such as flatulence and diarrhoea.",

            "This patient has trichomoniasis secondary to <i>Trichomonas vaginalis</i>, a sexually-transmitted disease classically causing offensive vaginal discharge, dysuria and vulval itching. Speculum examination may reveal a 'strawberry cervix' caused by multiple punctate haemorrhages of the cervix. <br /><br />Bacterial vaginosis is a common genital infection caused by vaginal bacterial overgrowth. It is not a sexually transmitted disease and there are multiple causes from excessive washing to recent antibiotic use. A lot of the time, the condition is asymptomatic. However, when present, common symptoms include a fishy vaginal discharge. Given the recent unprotected sexual intercourse and offensive discharge, combined with the physical examination findings, bacterial vaginosis is less likely to be the diagnosis.<br /><br />Chlamydia is the most common sexually transmitted disease with symptoms including dysuria and vaginal discharge. However, similarly to other sexually transmitted and genital infections, Chlamydia may also be asymptomatic. Chlamydia should remain a differential diagnosis for this patient, although the punctate cervical haemorrhages point towards trichomoniasis.<br /><br />Gonorrhoea is another sexually transmitted disease that causes altered vaginal discharge and dysuria. Cervical bleeding may be present secondary to the spread of infection to the endocervix.

        "question": "A 24-year-old woman visits her general practitioner with a 5-day history of offensive-smelling vaginal discharge following an episode of unprotected sexual intercourse. There is no history of fever or urinary symptoms and she has otherwise been feeling well. She denies pregnancy.<br /><br />On examination, she appears well with normal observations. There are multiple punctate lesions on her cervix and a malodorous green discharge.<br /><br />What is the most likely diagnosis?",
        "correct_answer": "5",
        "question_notes": "This patient has trichomoniasis secondary to <i>Trichomonas vaginalis</i>, a sexually-transmitted disease classically causing offensive vaginal discharge, dysuria and vulval itching. Speculum examination may reveal a 'strawberry cervix' caused by multiple punctate haemorrhages of the cervix. <br /><br />Bacterial vaginosis is a common genital infection caused by vaginal bacterial overgrowth. It is not a sexually transmitted disease and there are multiple causes from excessive washing to recent antibiotic use. A lot of the time, the condition is asymptomatic. However, when present, common symptoms include a fishy vaginal discharge. Given the recent unprotected sexual intercourse and offensive discharge, combined with the physical examination findings, bacterial vaginosis is less likely to be the diagnosis.<br /><br />Chlamydia is the most common sexually transmitted disease with symptoms including dysuria and vaginal discharge. However, similarly to other sexually transmitted and genital infections, Chlamydia may also be asymptomatic. Chlamydia should remain a differential diagnosis for this patient, although the punctate cervical haemorrhages point towards trichomoniasis.<br /><br />Gonorrhoea is another sexually transmitted disease that causes altered vaginal discharge and dysuria. Cervical bleeding may be present secondary to the spread of infection to the endocervix. However, the malodorous green discharge makes Gonorrhoea less likely to be the diagnosis.<br /><br />Syphillis is a less common sexually transmitted disease that presents in 3 stages - primary, secondary and tertiary. In the primary stages, symptoms manifest within 2 years from exposure to the organism (<i> Treponema pallidum</i>) and include genital lesions (chancre).

Drops of diluted allergen are placed on the skin after which the skin is pierced using a needle. A large number of allergens can be tested in one session. Normally includes a histamine (positive) and sterile water (negative) control. A wheal will typically develop if a patient has an allergy. Can be interpreted after 15 minutes<br /><br />Useful for food allergies and also pollen</td></tr><tr><td><b>Radioallergosorbent test (RAST)</b></td><td>Determines the amount of IgE that reacts specifically with suspected or known allergens, for example IgE to egg protein. Results are given in grades from 0 (negative) to 6 (strongly positive)<br /><br />Useful for food allergies, inhaled allergens (e.g. Pollen) and wasp/bee venom<br /><br />Blood tests may be used when skin prick tests are not suitable, for example if there is extensive eczema or if the patient is taking antihistamines</td></tr><tr><td><b>Skin patch testing</b></td><td>Useful for contact dermatitis. Around 30-40 allergens are placed on the back. Irritants may also be tested for. The patches are removed 48 hours later with the results being read by a dermatologist after a further 48 hours</td></tr></tbody></table></div>",
