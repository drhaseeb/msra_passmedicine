It would normally be reserved for patients who have had a severe relapse or 2 or more exacerbations in the past year. Side effects include nausea, bone marrow suppression, and pancreatitis.<br /><br /><b>Oral mesalazine plus prednisolone</b> would be useful in the short term for inducing remission that has not responded to topical treatments or oral mesalazine.

        "body": "In liver failure all clotting factors are low, except for factor VIII which is paradoxically supra-normal. This is because factor VIII is synthesised in endothelial cells throughout the body, unlike the other clotting factors which are synthesised purely in hepatic endothelial cells. Furthermore, whilst activated factor VIII is usually rapidly cleared from the blood stream, good hepatic function is required for this to occur, further leading to increases in circulating factor VIII. This is one of many reasons why, despite conventional coagulation studies (increased PT, APTT, decreased fibrinogen) suggesting increased bleeding risk, patients with chronic liver disease are not protected from venous thrombosis formation but are paradoxically at an increased risk of thrombosis, in addition to bleeding. Other events occurring in chronic liver disease which predispose patients to thrombosis formation include reduced synthesis of the purely hepatic derived natural anticoagulants protein c and protein s (vitamin k dependent), and anti-thrombin (non-vitamin k dependent). <br /><br />Reference <br /><br />Tripodi et al.

            "<b>CT coronary angiography</b> is the correct answer. The patient presents with symptoms highly suggestive of typical stable angina: constricting chest discomfort, precipitated by physical exertion, and relieved by rest. According to the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) guideline CG95 on 'Chest pain of recent onset', CT coronary angiography (CTCA) is the recommended first-line investigation for patients with stable chest pain in whom coronary artery disease is suspected and cannot be excluded by clinical assessment alone. The guideline was updated in 2016 to reflect the high diagnostic accuracy of modern CTCA in detecting or ruling out anatomically significant coronary artery disease. It has a very high negative predictive value, meaning a normal result effectively rules out the diagnosis. This has superseded previous investigation pathways that relied on pre-test probability scores and exercise tolerance testing. For this 58-year-old man, whose clinical picture is classic for angina despite a normal examination and resting ECG, CTCA will provide a definitive anatomical assessment of his coronary arteries to confirm or refute the suspected diagnosis.<br /><br /><b>Exercise tolerance test</b> is an incorrect option. While historically the exercise tolerance test (ETT) was the cornerstone of initial investigation for suspected stable angina, it is no longer recommended by NICE for this purpose. The ETT has been shown to have relatively low sensitivity and specificity for detecting coronary artery disease. It can produce a significant number of false-positive results, leading to unnecessary further invasive testing, and false-negative results, providing false reassurance. The NICE guidelines explicitly state not to use ETT to diagnose or rule out stable angina for people without known coronary artery disease. Modern imaging techniques, such as CTCA, offer superior diagnostic accuracy and are now the standard of care in the UK.<br /><br /><b>Invasive coronary angiography</b> is an incorrect choice for the <i>initial</i> investigation in this scenario. Invasive coronary angiography is considered the gold standard for visualising the coronary arteries and is essential for planning and performing revascularisation procedures like percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) or coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG). However, it is an invasive procedure with associated risks, including bleeding, vessel dissection, stroke, and myocardial infarction. Therefore, in the context of diagnosing stable angina, it is reserved as a third-line investigation according to NICE guidelines. It is typically performed if the results of non-invasive testing (like CTCA or functional imaging) are inconclusive or suggest significant disease where revascularisation is being considered.<br /><br /><b>Myocardial perfusion scintigraphy</b> is an incorrect option for the <i>initial</i> investigation. Myocardial perfusion scintigraphy (MPS) is a type of non-invasive <i>functional</i> imaging. It assesses blood flow to the myocardium at rest and during stress (pharmacological or exercise), identifying areas of reversible ischaemia. While it is a valuable test, NICE CG95 recommends it as a second-line investigation. It should be considered if the results of the first-line CTCA are uncertain or if the patient has known coronary artery disease and further assessment of ischaemia is required. Starting with an anatomical test like CTCA is now the preferred initial strategy.<br /><br /><b>Stress echocardiography</b> is also an incorrect choice for the <i>initial</i> investigation. Similar to myocardial perfusion scintigraphy, stress echocardiography is a non-invasive <i>functional</i> test. It assesses the heart's function using ultrasound during a period of stress (either exercise or dobutamine infusion), looking for the development of regional wall motion abnormalities which would indicate underlying ischaemia. As with other functional imaging tests, NICE recommends stress echocardiography as a second-line investigation for stable chest pain, to be used when CTCA is inconclusive, contraindicated, or if functional information is specifically required. The primary diagnostic question in this patient is anatomical - does he have coronary artery disease? - which is best answered first by CTCA.",
