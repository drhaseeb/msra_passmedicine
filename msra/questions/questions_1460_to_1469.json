Therefore six is the correct answer.<br /><br />When assessing responses, remember to record their best response, so in this case, this man gets a score of two for an extension response to pain (his left side), rather than no response at all (his right side). This means a GCS score should never be recorded as '13/14', for example, since if the best responses are taken the score should simply be recorded as '14'.",

            "The correct answer is <b>Vestibular neuronitis</b>, which is a self-limiting condition characterised by acute onset vertigo following a viral illness. The patient's presentation is classic: recent viral upper respiratory tract infection, followed by acute vertigo with nausea and horizontal nystagmus, but crucially without auditory symptoms. The vestibular nerve inflammation is typically unilateral, causing an acute vestibular syndrome with preservation of hearing, as the cochlear division is spared.<br /><br /><b>Viral labyrinthitis</b> is incorrect because although it also commonly follows a viral infection and presents with vertigo, it characteristically involves both the vestibular and cochlear portions of the inner ear. Therefore, patients typically present with hearing loss and/or tinnitus in addition to vertigo, which this patient does not have.<br /><br /><b>Transient ischaemic attack</b> is incorrect as vertigo from a TIA is typically brief (minutes), accompanied by other neurological symptoms, and would be unusual to persist for 4 days. Additionally, the history of preceding viral illness and the patient's relatively young age make a vascular cause less likely.<br /><br /><b>Acoustic neuroma</b> is incorrect because this benign tumour typically presents with gradual, unilateral hearing loss and tinnitus as primary symptoms. Vertigo may occur but is usually not the predominant feature, and the symptoms develop gradually rather than acutely.<br /><br /><b>Meniere's disease</b> is incorrect because it classically presents with episodic attacks of vertigo lasting 20 minutes to 12 hours, accompanied by fluctuating hearing loss, tinnitus, and aural fullness. This patient's continuous vertigo for 4 days and lack of auditory symptoms make Meniere's disease unlikely.",

            "<b>Cotard syndrome</b> is the correct answer. Cotard syndrome, also known as Cotard's delusion, is an eponymous psychiatric phenomenon in which patients believe that they are dead or decaying. Named after the neurologist Jules Cotard, Cotard syndrome is most often seen in patients with schizophrenia or severe depression, though may also rarely be seen in patients with organic neuropathology affecting the frontal lobe. <br /><br /><b>Capgras syndrome</b> is incorrect. Capgras syndrome is a neuropsychiatric phenomenon in which patients believe that a partner/family member/friend has been replaced by an imposter.<br /><br /><b>Charles Bonnet Syndrome</b> is incorrect. Charles Bonnet syndrome is a phenomenon in which patients with severe visual impairment report vivid hallucinations. Charles Bonnet syndrome is a complex neuropsychiatric/ophthalmological phenomenon and is commonly misdiagnosed as a primary psychosis. <br /><br /><b>Erotomania</b> is incorrect. Erotomania is a delusional disorder characterised by the mistaken perception that another person is infatuated with them. Affected patients often exhibit 'stalking' behaviour, and targets are classically socially unattainable, such as celebrities.<br /><br /><b>Othello syndrome</b> is incorrect. Othello syndrome, also known as delusional jealousy, is a delusional disorder with male preponderance in which patients hold a firmly held belief that their partner is unfaithful, in the absence of proof.",

The patient's daughter reports that he has stopped eating entirely and has made strange comments about death.<br /><br />On examination, the patient speaks with a quiet voice and does not make eye contact.<br /><br />When directly questioned on the change in eating pattern, the patient says: 'Why would I need to eat? I am already dead. Corpses have no need for food'. <br /><br />What psychiatric phenomenon is most consistent with this patient's presentation?",
        "correct_answer": "3",
        "question_notes": "<b>Cotard syndrome</b> is the correct answer. Cotard syndrome, also known as Cotard's delusion, is an eponymous psychiatric phenomenon in which patients believe that they are dead or decaying. Named after the neurologist Jules Cotard, Cotard syndrome is most often seen in patients with schizophrenia or severe depression, though may also rarely be seen in patients with organic neuropathology affecting the frontal lobe. <br /><br /><b>Capgras syndrome</b> is incorrect. Capgras syndrome is a neuropsychiatric phenomenon in which patients believe that a partner/family member/friend has been replaced by an imposter.<br /><br /><b>Charles Bonnet Syndrome</b> is incorrect. Charles Bonnet syndrome is a phenomenon in which patients with severe visual impairment report vivid hallucinations. Charles Bonnet syndrome is a complex neuropsychiatric/ophthalmological phenomenon and is commonly misdiagnosed as a primary psychosis. <br /><br /><b>Erotomania</b> is incorrect. Erotomania is a delusional disorder characterised by the mistaken perception that another person is infatuated with them. Affected patients often exhibit 'stalking' behaviour, and targets are classically socially unattainable, such as celebrities.<br /><br /><b>Othello syndrome</b> is incorrect. Othello syndrome, also known as delusional jealousy, is a delusional disorder with male preponderance in which patients hold a firmly held belief that their partner is unfaithful, in the absence of proof.",

            "<b>Progesterone</b> is the correct hormone to measure on day 21 of the menstrual cycle to assess ovulation. After ovulation, the corpus luteum forms from the ruptured follicle and begins to produce progesterone. This hormone is responsible for preparing the endometrium for potential implantation by increasing its vascularity and glandular development. In a typical 28-day cycle, progesterone levels peak approximately 7 days after ovulation (around day 21), making this the optimal time for measurement. A serum progesterone level greater than 30 nmol/L is generally indicative of ovulation having occurred. This patient's low BMI (18) is below the healthy range of 20-25 and may be contributing to anovulation, as adequate body fat is necessary for normal reproductive hormone production. Progesterone measurement is a standard part of fertility investigations and provides valuable information about luteal phase function.<br /><br /><b>Luteinising Hormone (LH)</b> is not the best choice for confirming ovulation on day 21. While LH is crucial in the ovulatory process and surges approximately 24-36 hours before ovulation (typically around day 12-14 in a 28-day cycle), its levels return to baseline shortly after ovulation occurs. By day 21, LH levels would have normalised regardless of whether ovulation took place, making it an unreliable marker at this point in the cycle. LH measurement is most useful when timed to detect the pre-ovulatory surge, typically through daily urine tests or serial blood tests around the expected time of ovulation.<br /><br /><b>Follicle Stimulating Hormone (FSH)</b> is not appropriate for assessing ovulation on day 21. FSH is primarily involved in the follicular phase of the menstrual cycle, stimulating the development of ovarian follicles. Its levels are highest during the early follicular phase (days 1-5) and decrease after ovulation due to negative feedback from rising oestrogen and progesterone. FSH measurement is more valuable as an assessment of ovarian reserve when measured on days 2-5 of the cycle, rather than as an indicator of ovulation. In this patient with suspected anovulation due to low BMI, FSH would not provide useful information about whether ovulation has occurred.<br /><br /><b>Oestrogen</b> (specifically oestradiol) is not the optimal hormone to measure on day 21 to confirm ovulation. While oestradiol levels do rise during the luteal phase, they are more variable and less specifically tied to ovulation than progesterone. Oestradiol is primarily produced by developing follicles during the follicular phase, with peak levels just before ovulation. After ovulation, oestradiol is produced by the corpus luteum alongside progesterone, but its pattern is less predictable and reliable for confirming ovulation has occurred. Additionally, oestradiol levels can be affected by multiple factors, making interpretation more challenging than progesterone in this context.<br /><br /><b>Human Chorionic Gonadotropin (hCG)</b> is not appropriate for assessing ovulation on day 21. hCG is not part of the normal ovulatory cycle but is instead produced by the developing placenta after implantation of a fertilised egg. Implantation typically occurs 6-12 days after ovulation, so even if conception had occurred, hCG would likely not be detectable by day 21 in most cycles. hCG is used to confirm pregnancy rather than ovulation. In this patient who has been unable to conceive for two years, measuring hCG would not provide useful information about her ovulatory status, which is the primary concern given her low BMI and suspected anovulation.",

        "title": "Osteoporosis: assessing risk",
        "body": "We worry about osteoporosis because of the increased risk of fragility fractures. So how do we assess which patients are at risk and need further investigation?<br /><br />NICE produced guidelines in 2012: Osteoporosis: assessing the risk of fragility fracture. The following is based on those guidelines.<br /><br />They advise that all women aged >= 65 years and all men aged >= 75 years should be assessed. Younger patients should be assessed in the presence of risk factors, such as:<br /><ul><li>previous fragility fracture</li><li>current use or frequent recent use of oral or systemic glucocorticoid</li><li>history of falls</li><li>family history of hip fracture</li><li>other causes of secondary osteoporosis, for example:<ul><li>hypogonadism in either sex including low testosterone in men and premature menopause in women</li><li>endocrine conditions, including diabetes mellitus, Cushing's disease, hyperthyroidism</li><li>conditions associated with malabsorption, including inflammatory bowel disease, coeliac disease, and chronic pancreatitis.</li><li>rheumatoid arthritis and other inflammatory arthropathies.</li></ul></li><li>low body mass index (BMI) (less than 18.5 kg/m\u00b2)</li><li>smoking</li><li>alcohol intake of more than 14 units per week for women and more than 14 units per week for men.</li></ul><br /><br /><h5 class='notes-heading'>Methods of risk assessment</h5><br />The first step is to <span class=\"concept\" data-cid=\"12223\">exclude secondary causes</span> of osteoporosis as underlying conditions may also require treatment. Examples of secondary causes are listed above.<br /><br />If a patient has had a recent fragility fracture, non-osteoporotic causes should be looked for, for example, bone metastases, myeloma and Paget's disease.<br /><br />A DEXA scan should be offered without calculating the fragilty risk score in the following situations:<br /><ul><li><span class=\"concept\" data-cid=\"12225\">> 50 years of age with a history of fragility fracture</span></li><li>< 40 years of age who have a major risk factor for fragility fracture - these patients should be referred to a specialist depending on the T-score</li><li>before starting treatments that may have a rapid adverse effect on bone density (for example, sex hormone deprivation for treatment for breast or prostate cancer)</li></ul><br /><h6 class='notes-subheading'>Fragility fracture risk score</h6><br />NICE recommends using a clinical prediction tool such as <span class=\"concept\" data-cid=\"12224\">FRAX or QFracture</span> to assess a patient's 10-year risk of developing a fracture. These take into account a number of factors, including the risk factors listed above. This is analogous to the cardiovascular risk tools such as QRISK.<br /><br /><h5 class='notes-heading'>Interpreting the results of FRAX</h5><br />It is important to note though that there is a lot of room for pragmatism and clinical judgement in these guidelines. This reflects the approximate nature of risk scoring and multiple factors that determine fracture risk. <br /><br />QFracture<br /><ul><li><span class=\"concept\" data-cid=\"12226\">if the 10-year fracture risk is \u2265 10% then a DEXA scan should be arranged</span></li></ul><br />FRAX<br /><ul><li>a colour 'risk' is given by the calculator - green, orange or red</li><li>patients in the orange zone should have a DEXA scan if not already done to further refine their 10-year risk</li><li>patients in the red zone should also have a DEXA scan if not already done to act as a baseline and guide drug treatment</li></ul><br /><h5 class='notes-heading'>When should we reassess a patient's risk?</h5><br />NICE recommend that we recalculate a patient's risk (i.e. repeat the FRAX/QFracture):<br /><div class='bs-callout bs-callout-default'><i><i><br /><ul><li>if the original calculated risk was in the region of the intervention threshold for a proposed treatment and only after a minimum of 2 years, or</li><li>when there has been a change in the person's risk factors</li></ul></i></i></div>",
