It is relatively common and thought to affect around 3-4% of the general population.

            "<b>Trial of diet and exercise</b> is the correct answer. This patient has two significant risk factors for gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM): a BMI > 30 kg/m\u00b2 and a previous macrosomic baby (>4.5 kg). The results of her oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT) meet the NICE diagnostic criteria for GDM, which are a fasting plasma glucose of \u2265 5.6 mmol/L or a 2-hour plasma glucose of \u2265 7.8 mmol/L. This patient's results are 6.1 mmol/L and 8.5 mmol/L respectively, confirming the diagnosis. According to NICE guideline NG3, for women with GDM, if the fasting plasma glucose at diagnosis is less than 7.0 mmol/L, the first-line management is a trial of lifestyle modification. This involves providing structured education on diet (focusing on low glycaemic index foods) and exercise (at least 30 minutes of moderate-intensity activity daily). The patient should also be taught to self-monitor her blood glucose levels. Pharmacological intervention is only considered if blood glucose targets are not met within 1-2 weeks of initiating these lifestyle changes. As this patient's fasting glucose is 6.1 mmol/L, this conservative approach is the most appropriate initial step.<br /><br /><b>Commence metformin</b> is incorrect at this stage. While metformin is the first-line pharmacological agent for GDM, it should only be initiated after a trial of diet and exercise has proven insufficient to meet glycaemic targets (typically over 1-2 weeks). The exception to this is if the fasting blood glucose is \u2265 7.0 mmol/L at diagnosis, in which case immediate pharmacological therapy (usually insulin) is warranted. Since this patient's fasting glucose is 6.1 mmol/L, commencing metformin immediately would be an unnecessary medicalisation of her condition before conservative measures have been attempted. It is the next step in the management pathway if lifestyle changes fail.<br /><br /><b>Commence glibenclamide</b> is incorrect. Glibenclamide, a sulfonylurea, is not a first-line agent for GDM in the UK. Its use is generally reserved for women who cannot tolerate metformin or in whom it is contraindicated. It may also be considered for women who do not achieve glycaemic control with metformin but decline insulin therapy. Given that this is a new diagnosis and no other treatments have been trialled, initiating glibenclamide would be inappropriate and contrary to NICE guidelines.<br /><br /><b>Commence subcutaneous insulin</b> is incorrect. Immediate initiation of insulin is reserved for more severe hyperglycaemia at diagnosis. NICE guidelines recommend considering immediate insulin therapy (with or without metformin) if the fasting plasma glucose level is \u2265 7.0 mmol/L at diagnosis. Insulin is also considered if there are complications such as macrosomia or hydramnios with a fasting glucose of 6.0\u20136.9 mmol/L. However, for an uncomplicated initial presentation with a fasting glucose of 6.1 mmol/L, a trial of diet and exercise is the most appropriate first step.<br /><br /><b>Reassurance and repeat OGTT in 4 weeks</b> is incorrect and potentially harmful. This patient's OGTT results have already met the diagnostic criteria for GDM. Providing reassurance and delaying treatment would miss a crucial window for intervention. Untreated or poorly controlled GDM is associated with significant maternal and fetal risks, including pre-eclampsia, macrosomia, birth trauma, shoulder dystocia, and neonatal hypoglycaemia. Therefore, a confirmed diagnosis requires prompt initiation of management, which in this case is lifestyle modification.",

The results of her oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT) meet the NICE diagnostic criteria for GDM, which are a fasting plasma glucose of \u2265 5.6 mmol/L or a 2-hour plasma glucose of \u2265 7.8 mmol/L. This patient's results are 6.1 mmol/L and 8.5 mmol/L respectively, confirming the diagnosis. According to NICE guideline NG3, for women with GDM, if the fasting plasma glucose at diagnosis is less than 7.0 mmol/L, the first-line management is a trial of lifestyle modification. This involves providing structured education on diet (focusing on low glycaemic index foods) and exercise (at least 30 minutes of moderate-intensity activity daily). The patient should also be taught to self-monitor her blood glucose levels. Pharmacological intervention is only considered if blood glucose targets are not met within 1-2 weeks of initiating these lifestyle changes. As this patient's fasting glucose is 6.1 mmol/L, this conservative approach is the most appropriate initial step.<br /><br /><b>Commence metformin</b> is incorrect at this stage. While metformin is the first-line pharmacological agent for GDM, it should only be initiated after a trial of diet and exercise has proven insufficient to meet glycaemic targets (typically over 1-2 weeks). The exception to this is if the fasting blood glucose is \u2265 7.0 mmol/L at diagnosis, in which case immediate pharmacological therapy (usually insulin) is warranted. Since this patient's fasting glucose is 6.1 mmol/L, commencing metformin immediately would be an unnecessary medicalisation of her condition before conservative measures have been attempted. It is the next step in the management pathway if lifestyle changes fail.<br /><br /><b>Commence glibenclamide</b> is incorrect. Glibenclamide, a sulfonylurea, is not a first-line agent for GDM in the UK. Its use is generally reserved for women who cannot tolerate metformin or in whom it is contraindicated. It may also be considered for women who do not achieve glycaemic control with metformin but decline insulin therapy. Given that this is a new diagnosis and no other treatments have been trialled, initiating glibenclamide would be inappropriate and contrary to NICE guidelines.<br /><br /><b>Commence subcutaneous insulin</b> is incorrect. Immediate initiation of insulin is reserved for more severe hyperglycaemia at diagnosis. NICE guidelines recommend considering immediate insulin therapy (with or without metformin) if the fasting plasma glucose level is \u2265 7.0 mmol/L at diagnosis. Insulin is also considered if there are complications such as macrosomia or hydramnios with a fasting glucose of 6.0\u20136.9 mmol/L. However, for an uncomplicated initial presentation with a fasting glucose of 6.1 mmol/L, a trial of diet and exercise is the most appropriate first step.<br /><br /><b>Reassurance and repeat OGTT in 4 weeks</b> is incorrect and potentially harmful. This patient's OGTT results have already met the diagnostic criteria for GDM. Providing reassurance and delaying treatment would miss a crucial window for intervention. Untreated or poorly controlled GDM is associated with significant maternal and fetal risks, including pre-eclampsia, macrosomia, birth trauma, shoulder dystocia, and neonatal hypoglycaemia. Therefore, a confirmed diagnosis requires prompt initiation of management, which in this case is lifestyle modification.",

It is important to recognise atypical pneumonia as it may not respond to penicillins or cephalosporins due to it lacking a peptidoglycan cell wall.<br /><br /><span class=\"concept\" data-cid=\"8401\">Features</span><br /><ul><li>the disease typically has a prolonged and gradual onset</li><li>flu-like symptoms classically precede a dry cough</li><li>bilateral consolidation on x-ray</li><li>complications may occur as below</li></ul><br />Complications<br /><ul><li><span class=\"concept\" data-cid=\"8404\">cold agglutins (IgM)</span>: may cause an <span class=\"concept\" data-cid=\"8405\">haemolytic anaemia</span>, thrombocytopenia</li><li><span class=\"concept\" data-cid=\"2350\">erythema multiforme</span>, erythema nodosum</li><li>meningoencephalitis, Guillain-Barre syndrome and other <span class=\"concept\" data-cid=\"7904\">immune-mediated neurological diseases</span></li><li><span class=\"concept\" data-cid=\"8403\">bullous myringitis</span>: painful vesicles on the tympanic membrane</li><li>pericarditis/myocarditis</li><li>gastrointestinal: hepatitis, pancreatitis</li><li>renal: acute glomerulonephritis</li></ul><br />Investigations<br /><ul><li>diagnosis is generally by Mycoplasma <span class=\"concept\" data-cid=\"772\">serology</span></li><li><span class=\"concept\" data-cid=\"8402\">positive cold agglutination test</span> &rarr; <span class=\"concept\" data-cid=\"12024\">peripheral blood smear may show red blood cell agglutination</span></li></ul><br />Management<br /><ul><li><span class=\"concept\" data-cid=\"771\">doxycycline or a macrolide</span> (e.g. erythromycin/clarithromycin)</li></ul><br /><CENTER><table><tr><td align = 'left' colspan='2'><a data-fancybox class='fancybox' rel='group' href='https://d32xxyeh8kfs8k.cloudfront.net/images_Passmedicine/pdd903b.png'><img class='ajaximage' src='https://d32xxyeh8kfs8k.cloudfront.net/images_Passmedicine/pdd903.png'/></a></td></tr><tr><td valign='top' align='left'></td><td align='right'><a data-fancybox class='fancybox lbmagglasslink' rel='group' href='https://d32xxyeh8kfs8k.cloudfront.net/images_Passmedicine/pdd903b.png'><img src='https://d32xxyeh8kfs8k.cloudfront.net/css/images/mag_glass.png'/></a></td></tr></table></CENTER><div class='imagetext'>Comparison of Legionella and Mycoplasma pneumonia</div>",

        "body": "In 2016 the Chief Medical Officer proposed new guidelines in relation to the safe consumption of alcohol following an expert group report. The most significant change has been a reduction in the number of units it is recommending men do not exceed from 21 to 14, in line with the recommendations for women.<br /><br />The government now recommend the following:<br /><ul><li>men <b>and</b> women should drink no more than 14 units of alcohol per week</li><li>they advise <i>'if you do drink as much as 14 units per week, it is best to spread this evenly over 3 days or more'</i></li><li>pregnant women should not drink. The wording of the official advice is '<i>If you are pregnant or planning a pregnancy, the safest approach is not to drink alcohol at all, to keep risks to your baby to a minimum. Drinking in pregnancy can lead to long-term harm to the baby, with the more you drink the greater the risk.</i>'</li></ul><br />One unit of alcohol is equal to 10 mL of pure ethanol. The 'strength' of an alcoholic drink is determined by the 'alcohol by volume' (ABV).<br /><br />Examples of one unit of alcohol:<br /><ul><li>25ml single measure of spirits (ABV 40%)</li><li>a third of a pint of beer (ABV 5 to 6%)</li><li>half a 175ml 'standard' glass of red wine (ABV 12%)</li></ul><br />To calculate the number of units in a drink multiply the number of millilitres by the ABV and divide by 1,000. For example:<br /><ul><li>half a 175ml 'standard' glass of red wine = 87.5 * 12 / 1000 = 1.05 units</li><li>one bottle of wine = 750 * 12 / 1000 = 9 units</li><li>one pint of 5% beer or lager = 568 * 5 / 1000 = 2.8 units</li></ul>",

            "The correct answer in this case is <b>Desmopressin</b>. Desmopressin is a synthetic analogue of the antidiuretic hormone (ADH) vasopressin, which acts on the kidneys to reduce urine production at night. This can help manage nocturnal enuresis in children who have not responded to non-pharmacological treatments such as an enuresis alarm. According to the UK guidelines, desmopressin is considered a first-line pharmacological treatment for nocturnal enuresis.<br /><br />Now let's discuss the other options:<br /><br /><b>Lactulose</b> is a type of osmotic laxative that helps to soften stools and promote bowel movements. It would not be an appropriate treatment option for this patient as he does not have constipation or any issues with bowel movements.<br /><br /><b>Cognitive behavioural therapy</b> (CBT) may be used to address psychological factors contributing to some cases of nocturnal enuresis, but it's typically not the first line of treatment. In this case, since there are no daytime micturition issues and the child has already tried using an enuresis alarm without success, CBT would likely be less effective than pharmacological interventions like desmopressin.<br /><br /><b>Imipramine</b> is a tricyclic antidepressant that may also be used for treating nocturnal enuresis due to its anticholinergic effects on bladder function. However, imipramine is generally reserved for patients who have not responded adequately to other treatments like desmopressin or alarms because of its potential side effects and risk of toxicity in overdose situations.<br /><br />Finally, <b>Duloxetine</b> is a selective serotonin-norepinephrine reuptake inhibitor (SNRI) antidepressant that can be used in the management of stress urinary incontinence in adults. It is not indicated for the treatment of nocturnal enuresis in children, and there is limited evidence to support its use in this context.",
