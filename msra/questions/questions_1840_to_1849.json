The patient has a severe vitamin B12 deficiency with associated neurological symptoms (fatigue, paraesthesia, and gait instability). B12 deficiency should be treated first to prevent further neurological damage. NICE and British Society for Haematology (BSH) recommend intramuscular vitamin B12 (hydroxocobalamin) as the initial treatment for symptomatic B12 deficiency, especially when neurological signs are present. Once B12 levels are replenished or on their way to correction, folic acid supplementation can be added to address the folate deficiency. BSH emphasises that treating folate deficiency first can mask the haematological signs of B12 deficiency and worsen neurological symptoms.
