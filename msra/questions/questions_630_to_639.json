            "<b>Postoperative ileus</b> is the correct answer. This patient presents with the classic features of postoperative ileus following major bowel surgery. The key clinical features are abdominal distention, inability to pass flatus, and notably absent bowel sounds reflecting reduced peristalsis. The timing (3 days post-surgery) is typical, as postoperative ileus commonly occurs within the first few days after abdominal surgery, particularly following procedures involving extensive bowel handling such as a right hemicolectomy. The absence of significant tenderness and the diffuse, non-colicky nature of the discomfort are characteristic. Postoperative ileus represents a temporary reduction in bowel motility rather than a mechanical obstruction. Management involves conservative measures including nil-by-mouth, IV fluids with electrolyte correction (particularly potassium, magnesium and phosphate), and potentially nasogastric decompression if vomiting occurs. Most cases resolve spontaneously within 3-5 days with supportive care.<br /><br /><b>Anastomotic leak</b> would typically present with more concerning features including fever, tachycardia, peritonism, and signs of sepsis. While it can occur around day 3-7 post-operatively, the absence of significant tenderness and systemic upset makes this less likely. Patients with anastomotic leak usually appear unwell with localised peritonitis at the leak site.<br /><br /><b>Small bowel obstruction</b> would typically present with colicky abdominal pain (rather than the dull discomfort described), high-pitched or tinkling bowel sounds (not absent sounds), and more prominent vomiting. The absence of bowel sounds and the non-colicky nature of the pain argue against mechanical obstruction.<br /><br /><b>Intra-abdominal collection</b> would usually present with fever, localised tenderness, and signs of sepsis. While collections can develop post-operatively, the clinical picture here with generalised distention and absent bowel sounds without significant tenderness or systemic features is more consistent with ileus.<br /><br /><b>Large bowel obstruction</b> would be unusual immediately following a right hemicolectomy where the pathology has been resected. Additionally, mechanical large bowel obstruction would typically present with more severe symptoms, visible peristalsis, and high-pitched bowel sounds rather than absent sounds.",

            "The correct answer is the <b>Lateral cutaneous nerve of thigh</b>. Meralgia paraesthetica, also known as Bernhardt-Roth syndrome, is a condition characterised by numbness, tingling and burning pain in the outer part of your thigh. It's caused by compression of the lateral cutaneous nerve of the thigh (also called the lateral femoral cutaneous nerve), which supplies sensation to your skin's surface on your upper thigh.<br /><br />The first incorrect option is the <b>Common peroneal nerve</b>. This nerve branches from the sciatic nerve and provides sensation over the anterior and lateral aspects of the leg and foot. Damage to this nerve can cause foot drop but it would not cause symptoms in the anterolateral aspect of the thigh.<br /><br />The second incorrect option is the <b>Anterior cutaneous nerve of thigh</b>. This nerve arises from the femoral nerve and supplies the skin on the front part of the thigh. Its damage or compression would result in sensory loss or abnormal sensations in this area, not specifically on the anterolateral aspect.<br /><br />The third incorrect option is <b>Posterior cutaneous nerve of thigh</b>. This branch from the sciatic nerve supplies sensation to the posterior aspect of the thigh, buttock and popliteal fossa. Therefore, its involvement wouldn't result in symptoms over the anterolateral aspect of the right thigh.<br /><br />Lastly, <b>Sciatic nerve</b> itself is an incorrect choice because it gives off many branches including common peroneal and tibial nerves which supply the lower leg and foot. It does give off a posterior cutaneous branch for the back of the thigh but doesn't directly supply the anterolateral aspect of the right thigh.",

        "body": "Meralgia paraesthetica comes from the Greek words meros for thigh and algos for pain and is often described as a syndrome of paraesthesia or anaesthesia in the distribution of the lateral femoral cutaneous nerve (LFCN). It is an entrapment mononeuropathy of the LFCN, but can also be iatrogenic after a surgical procedure, or result from a neuroma. Although uncommon, meralgia paraesthetica is not rare and is hence probably underdiagnosed.<br /><br />Anatomy<br /><ul><li>The LFCN is primarily a sensory nerve, carrying no motor fibres.</li><li>It most commonly originates from the L2/3 segments.</li><li>After passing behind the psoas muscle, it runs beneath the iliac fascia as it crosses the surface of the iliac muscle and eventually exits through or under the lateral aspect of the inguinal ligament.</li><li>As the nerve curves medially and inferiorly around the anterior superior iliac spine (ASIS), it may be subject to repetitive trauma or pressure.</li><li>Compression of this nerve anywhere along its course can lead to the development of meralgia paraesthetica. </li></ul><br />Epidemiology<br /><ul><li>The majority of cases occur in people aged between 30 and 40.</li><li>In some, both legs may be affected. </li><li>It is more common in men than women.</li><li>Occurs more commonly in those with diabetes than in the general population. </li></ul><br />Risk factors <sup>3</sup><br /><ul><li>Obesity </li><li>Pregnancy </li><li>Tense ascites </li><li>Trauma</li><li>Iatrogenic, such as pelvic osteotomy, spinal surgeries, laparoscopic hernia repair and bariatric surgery. In some cases, may result from abduction splints used in the management of Perthe's disease. </li><li>Various sports have been implicated, including gymnastics, football, bodybuilding and strenuous exercise.</li><li>Some cases are idiopathic. </li></ul><br />Patients typically present with the following symptoms in the upper lateral aspect of the thigh: <br /><ul><li>Burning, tingling, coldness, or shooting pain</li><li>Numbness </li><li>Deep muscle ache</li><li>Symptoms are usually aggravated by standing, and relieved by sitting </li><li>They can be mild and resolve spontaneously or may severely restrict the patient for many years. </li></ul><br />Signs:<br /><ul><li>Symptoms may be reproduced by deep palpation just below the ASIS (pelvic compression) and also by extension of the hip.</li><li>There is altered sensation over the upper lateral aspect of the thigh.</li><li>There is no motor weakness. </li></ul><br />Investigations:<br /><ul><li>The pelvic compression test is highly sensitive, and often, meralgia paraesthetica can be diagnosed based on this test alone</li><li>Injection of the nerve with local anaesthetic will abolish the pain. Using ultrasound is effective both for diagnosis and guiding injection therapy in meralgia paraesthetica</li><li>Nerve conduction studies may be useful.</li></ul>",

This approach allows for immediate treatment of her symptoms, while also ensuring the infection is properly investigated. Should the causative organism not be sensitive to trimethoprim, the antibiotic choice can be adjusted. <br /><br /><b> Commence trimethoprim </b> is incorrect. While this is likely the best antibiotic choice, this option misses the important part of sending a urine specimen for culture and sensitivity. <br /><br /><b> Commence trimethoprim and dip urine </b> is incorrect. While this is likely the best antibiotic choice, NICE suggest that urine dipstick is not relied on to diagnose UTI in patients aged > 65.  In older adults, dipstick tests can often yield false positives due to asymptomatic bacteriuria being more common in this age group.<br /><br /><b> Do not prescribe antibiotics and send urine for culture and sensitivity </b> is incorrect. Given her convincing history and previous confirmed UTI, it is likely most appropriate to prescribe antibiotics based on previous sensitivities. <br /><br /><b>Commence co-amoxiclav and send urine for culture and sensitivity </b> is incorrect. Given her previous sensitivity to trimethoprim, this would be a better option. Co-amoxiclav is not recommended first line, due to its variable efficacy on common urinary pathogens and broad spectrum antibiotics contributing to antibiotic resistance.",

This is because the patient has a significant increase in blood pressure (\u2265140/90 mmHg) after 20 weeks of gestation without any proteinuria or other systemic features. According to UK guidelines, gestational hypertension is diagnosed when there is new-onset hypertension during pregnancy without any proteinuria or other features suggestive of pre-eclampsia.<br /><br />The option <b>moderate pre-eclampsia</b> is incorrect as this condition requires the presence of hypertension and proteinuria (\u22651+ on a dipstick or \u2265300 mg/24 hours) along with one or more adverse conditions such as severe headache, visual disturbances, epigastric pain, or abnormal laboratory results. In this case, the patient has no proteinuria or other symptoms suggestive of pre-eclampsia.<br /><br />Similarly, <b>mild pre-eclampsia</b> is also incorrect as it requires the presence of both hypertension and proteinuria after 20 weeks of gestation.
