            "The history and blood results are in keeping with chronic myeloid leukaemia (CML), indicated by the high white cell count which is due to high numbers of myeloid cells and the chronic nature of the presentation. The absence of blast cells indicates this is not acute leukaemia. The presence of anaemia and thrombocytopenia is due to bone marrow dysfunction, usually caused by myelofibrosis, indicating a need to start treatment. The first-line treatment for CML is the tyrosine kinase inhibitor imatinib. It is taken as a daily tablet and has excellent results in CML.<br /><br />Conservative management is inappropriate now the patient has developed signs of bone marrow dysfunction. There is a role for no treatment in early disease that has been picked up incidentally on a blood test, but at this point this patient needs treatment.<br /><br />Fludarabine and cyclophosphamide are both chemotherapy agents used in treating chronic lymphocytic leukaemia (CLL). They have no role in managing CML. The abnormalities on the blood tests expected in CLL are similar, but with a differential showing normal or low neutrophil and high lymphocyte counts.<br /><br />Prednisolone is a glucocorticoid used to treat many conditions. It is often used in treating various forms of lymphoma but has no role in managing CML.<br /><br />Rituximab is a chimeric monoclonal antibody directed at CD20, a lymphocyte marker.

            "<b>Idiopathic membranous nephropathy</b> is the correct diagnosis. This patient presents with classical features of nephrotic syndrome (oedema, heavy proteinuria, and hypoalbuminaemia). Membranous nephropathy is the most common cause of nephrotic syndrome in non-diabetic white adults. Approximately 70-80% of cases are primary (idiopathic), and the discovery of antibodies to the M-type phospholipase A2 receptor (PLA2R) on podocytes has been a major advance. A positive anti-PLA2R antibody test is highly specific (around 99%) for primary membranous nephropathy. Its presence, in the context of nephrotic syndrome, is now considered diagnostic by many centres, sometimes obviating the need for a renal biopsy. The patient's age and the absence of features suggesting a secondary cause further support this diagnosis.<br /><br /><b>Minimal change disease</b> is a plausible cause of nephrotic syndrome in adults, although it is far more common in children. It is characterised by the effacement of podocyte foot processes, which is only visible on electron microscopy. Patients typically present with abrupt onset of nephrotic syndrome and often have preserved renal function. However, minimal change disease is not associated with the presence of anti-PLA2R antibodies, making this diagnosis incorrect in this scenario.<br /><br /><b>Focal segmental glomerulosclerosis (FSGS)</b> is another leading cause of nephrotic syndrome in adults. It can be primary (idiopathic) or secondary to conditions such as HIV, obesity, or reflux nephropathy. The diagnosis is histological, showing sclerosis in some parts (segmental) of some glomeruli (focal). While it is an important differential for nephrotic syndrome in this age group, it is not associated with anti-PLA2R antibodies. The positive antibody result effectively rules out primary FSGS.<br /><br /><b>Lupus nephritis</b> can present with a membranous pattern (Class V lupus nephritis) and cause nephrotic syndrome. This represents a secondary cause of membranous nephropathy. However, this patient has no other clinical or serological features to suggest systemic lupus erythematosus (e.g., rash, arthritis, positive ANA/dsDNA). Furthermore, while anti-PLA2R antibodies can rarely be seen in secondary causes, their presence strongly points towards a primary, idiopathic aetiology.<br /><br /><b>Diabetic nephropathy</b> is the most common cause of end-stage renal disease in the UK and a very common cause of proteinuria. However, this diagnosis requires a history of diabetes mellitus, typically for at least 5-10 years, which is not mentioned in this patient's history. The clinical presentation and, most importantly, the specific positive anti-PLA2R antibody test make diabetic nephropathy an incorrect diagnosis.",

        "title": "Abdominal aortic aneurysm: pathophysiology",
        "body": "Abdominal aortic aneurysms occur primarily as a result of the failure of elastic proteins within the extracellular matrix. Aneurysms typically represent dilation of all layers of the arterial wall. Approximately 80-90% of abdominal aortic aneurysms (AAAs) occur in the <span class=\"concept\" data-cid=\"12329\">infrarenal</span> segment of the aorta.<br /><br />Most aneurysms are caused by degenerative disease. After the age of 50 years the normal diameter of the infrarenal aorta is 1.5cm in females and 1.7cm in males. Diameters of 3cm and greater, are considered aneurysmal. The pathophysiology involved in the development of aneurysms is complex and the primary event is loss of the intima with loss of elastic fibres from the media. This process is associated with, and potentiated by, increased proteolytic activity and lymphocytic infiltration. <br /><br />Major risk factors for the development of aneurysms include smoking and hypertension. Rare but important causes include syphilis and connective tissues diseases such as Ehlers Danlos type 1 and Marfan's syndrome.",

            "The correct answer is <b>Tetracycline</b>. Tetracyclines are a group of broad-spectrum antibiotics that are known to cause photosensitivity reactions, which can result in a skin rash. This happens because tetracyclines can increase the skin's sensitivity to sunlight and ultraviolet light. Photosensitivity reactions are considered as one of the common side effects of tetracyclines.<br /><br /><b>Gentamicin</b> is an incorrect option. Gentamicin, an aminoglycoside antibiotic, is not typically associated with photosensitive rashes. The primary concern with gentamicin use is nephrotoxicity and ototoxicity rather than dermatological reactions.<br /><br /><b>Erythromycin</b> is also an incorrect choice. Erythromycin, a macrolide antibiotic, may cause several side effects such as gastrointestinal disturbances but it does not commonly cause photosensitivity reactions.<br /><br />The third incorrect option is <b>Penicillin</b>. Penicillins are widely used antibiotics that can lead to various adverse reactions including hypersensitivity reactions and gastrointestinal upset. However, they do not typically result in photosensitive rashes.<br /><br />Lastly, <b>Amoxicillin</b>, another member of the penicillin group of antibiotics, is incorrectly listed as well.
