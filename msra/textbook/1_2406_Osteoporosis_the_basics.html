[{"notes_id":"1_2406","category":"6","subcategory":"2","title":"Osteoporosis: the basics","body":"Osteoporosis is a disorder affecting the skeletal system characterised by loss of bone mass. Bone mineral density decreases with age but the World Health Organisation define osteoporosis as presence of bone mineral density (BMD) of less than 2.5 standard deviations (SD) below the young adult mean density.<br \/><br \/>Osteoporosis is an important as it increases the risk of fragility (i.e. non-traumatic) fractures. Certain fragility fractures such as fractured neck of femur are associated with significant morbidity and mortality. Around 50% of post-menopausal women will suffer an osteoporotic fracture at some point.<br \/><br \/>The major risk factors for osteoporosis are age and female gender. Other risk factors include:<br \/><ul><li>corticosteroid use<\/li><li>smoking<\/li><li>alcohol<\/li><li>low body mass index<\/li><li>family history<\/li><\/ul><br \/>Guidelines recommend using a screening tool such as FRAX or QFracture to assess the 10-year risk of a patient developing a fragility fracture. A patient who has sustained a fragility fracture (e.g. following a Colles' wrist fracture) should also be assessed for osteoporosis.<br \/><br \/>To assess the actual bone mineral density a dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry (DEXA) scan is used. The DEXA scan looks at the hip and lumbar spine. If either have a T score of < -2.5 then treatment is recommended.<br \/><br \/>The first-line treatment for osteoporosis is an oral bisphosphonate such as alendronate. Other treatments are available but the vast majority of patients are managed with this therapy.","notes_hash":"c4d9d37f4cb22c2b5e886b6dfeb7e5c3","knowledge_graph_node_id_link":10843,"links":"","media":"","concepts_for_notes":[],"category_name":"Musculoskeletal","subcategory_name":"Rheumatology","comment_count":2},"",[]]
