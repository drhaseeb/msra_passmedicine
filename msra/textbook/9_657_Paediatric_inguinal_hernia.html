[{"notes_id":"9_657","category":"7","subcategory":"0","title":"Paediatric inguinal hernia","body":"Inguinal hernias are a common disorder in children. They are commoner in males as the testis migrates from its location on the posterior abdominal wall, down through the inguinal canal. A patent processus vaginalis may persist and be the site of subsequent hernia development. <br \/><br \/>Children presenting in the first few months of life are at the highest risk of strangulation and the hernia should be repaired urgently. Children over 1 year of age are at lower risk and surgery may be performed electively. For paediatric hernias a herniotomy without implantation of mesh is sufficient. Most cases are performed as day cases, neonates and premature infants are kept in hospital overnight as there is a recognised increased risk of post operative apnoea.","notes_hash":"c695a37820eee69e84cb3c3e8ddc7d0c","knowledge_graph_node_id_link":0,"links":"","media":"","concepts_for_notes":[],"category_name":"Paediatrics","subcategory_name":"","comment_count":1},"",[]]
