[{"notes_id":"1_2888","category":"5","subcategory":"1","title":"Norovirus","body":"Norovirus, also known as the winter vomiting bug, is one of the most common causes of gastroenteritis in the UK according to NHS England. It is a genus that encompasses a range of non encapsulated RNA virus species. The CDC (Centre for Disease Prevention and Control) estimates that 1 in 5 cases of infectious gastroenteritis are caused by norovirus, with 685 million cases per year worldwide. <br \/><br \/>Symptoms <br \/><ul><li>Develop within 15 - 50 hours of infection (quoted from the European Centre of Disease Control and Prevention), with patients experiencing nausea, vomiting, and diarrhoea, which may be accompanied by headaches, low-grade fevers, and myalgia. <\/li><li><span class=\"concept\" data-cid=\"10319\">The majority of patients experience both vomiting and diarrhoea<\/span><\/li><li>10 - 22% reported a headache and up to 47% of patients reported fevers (Clinical Microbiology Reviews, Norovirus, January 2015)<\/li><\/ul><br \/>Transmission <br \/><ul><li>Faecal-oral route, with the virus becoming aerosolized when the patient vomits or when a toilet containing infected bodily fluids (vomit or faeces) is flushed. <\/li><li>Viral particles are transmitted directly to surrounding potential hosts and to surrounding surfaces, from which they can be transmitted by cross-contamination (for example a patient visitor touching the patient environment, then eating without first washing their hands). <\/li><li>Infection may also be transmitted from an infected individual in the process of direct physical contact, or contact with food preparation. <\/li><li>The virus enters the cell via host receptor-mediated endocytosis and replicates in the small intestine. Norovirus is highly contagious, the European Centre of Disease Control and Prevention estimates that only 10 - 100 viral particles are required to cause an active infection. <\/li><li>Norovirus is not at present considered to be a notifiable disease in the UK. <\/li><\/ul><br \/>Limiting transmission<br \/><ul><li>Isolation of infected strongly recommended where possible, particularly in areas where the risk of person to person transmission is high, for example, in hospitals schools, and care facilities<\/li><li>Good hand hygiene using soap and water is essential  <\/li><li><span class=\"concept\" data-cid=\"10320\">Alcohol hand gel has been shown to be less effective in reducing transmission<\/span><\/li><\/ul><br \/>Diagnosis <br \/><ul><li>Clinical history and stool culture viral PCR (polymerase chain reaction). <\/li><\/ul><br \/>Differential diagnoses <br \/><ul><li>Features most suggestive of norovirus include sudden onset vomiting, relatively short duration of symptoms and contact with others with similar symptoms.<\/li><li>Rotavirus, <i>E. coli<\/i> and Salmonella infections will all cause similar clinical pictures, however, there are some important differentiating features. <\/li><li>Salmonella infection has an incubation period of 6 - 72 hours and is often the result of contact with contaminated animal products, for example, unpasteurized eggs or milk. Unlike norovirus, salmonella gastroenteritis can cause bloody diarrhoea and patients often have a high fever. <\/li><li>Rotavirus gastroenteritis causes symptoms very similar to those of norovirus, but predominantly affects children under the age of 5 years. <\/li><li><i>E. coli<\/i> infection, like Norovirus, causes vomiting and diarrhoea but has a longer incubation period (between 3-4 days but can be up to 10 days following pathogen exposure) and unlike Norovirus, E Coli infection commonly causes severe abdominal cramping and frequently causes bloody diarrhoea. <\/li><\/ul><br \/>Resolution and Potential Complications<br \/><ul><li>The infection is self-limiting in immunocompetent patients and symptoms generally resolve within 72 hours<\/li><li>Dehydration and electrolyte imbalances may arise as a result of vomiting and diarrhoea, leading to significant morbidity and mortality and patients should be managed supportively with rehydration and electrolyte supplementation where necessary.<\/li><\/ul>","notes_hash":"a6a0015b26ce944f6d3d3cfb4fbb7343","knowledge_graph_node_id_link":0,"links":"","media":"<table><tr><td colspan=\"2\"><a href=\"#\" class=\"media_link\" data-url=\"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/embed\/N-8EtuXs9WM\" data-description=\"Norovirus \" data-upvotes=\"6\" data-downvotes=\"0\" data-media=\"862\"><img border=\"0\" class=\"img-thumbnail\" alt=\"YouTube\" src=\"https:\/\/i1.ytimg.com\/vi\/N-8EtuXs9WM\/mqdefault.jpg\" style=\"max-width:150px;\"><\/a><\/td><\/tr><tr ><td style=\"padding-top:10px\" colspan=\"2\"><a style=\"\" href=\"#\" class=\"media_link\" data-url=\"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/embed\/N-8EtuXs9WM\" data-description=\"Norovirus \" data-upvotes=\"6\" data-downvotes=\"0\" data-media=\"862\">Norovirus <\/a><\/td><\/tr><tr><td><span ><small>Osmosis - YouTube<\/small><\/span><\/td><td style = \"float: right;width:115px;\"><button type=\"button\" style=\"\" id=\"media_like_1508\" data-mediaid=\"1508\" data-rating=\"1\" class=\"rate-media btn btn-link\"><svg class=\"bi bi-hand-thumbs-up\" width=\"16\" height=\"16\"><use xlink:href=\"#icon-hand-thumbs-up\"\/><\/svg><\/button><span id=\"media_good_count_1508\" class = \"media_good_count\" style=\"color:green; font-size:85%;\">6<\/span><button type=\"button\" style=\"\" id=\"media_dislike_1508\" data-mediaid=\"1508\" data-rating=\"0\" class=\"rate-media btn btn-link\"><svg class=\"bi bi-hand-thumbs-down\" width=\"16\" height=\"16\"><use xlink:href=\"#icon-hand-thumbs-down\"\/><\/svg><\/button><span id=\"media_bad_count_1508\" class = \"media_bad_count\" style=\"color:red; font-size:85%;\">0<\/span><\/td><\/tr><\/table>","concepts_for_notes":{"10319":{"concept_text":"The majority of patients with norovirus experience both vomiting and diarrhoea","concept_percentile":"98"},"10320":{"concept_text":"Alcohol gels are less effective than handwashing in preventing the spread of norovirus","concept_percentile":"52"}},"category_name":"Infectious disease \/ Haematology \/ Immunology","subcategory_name":"Infectious disease","comment_count":2},"",[]]
