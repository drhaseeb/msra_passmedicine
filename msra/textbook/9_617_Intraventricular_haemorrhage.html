It is relatively rare in adult surgical practice and when it does occur, it is typically associated with severe head injuries. In premature neonates it may occur spontaneously. The blood may clot and occlude CSF flow, hydrocephalus may result. <br \/><br \/>In neonatal practice the vast majority of IVH occur in the first 72 hours after birth, the aetiology is not well understood and it is suggested to occur as a result of birth trauma combined with cellular hypoxia, together the with the delicate neonatal CNS. <br \/><br \/><h5 class='notes-heading'>Treatment<\/h5><br \/>Is largely supportive, therapies such as intraventricular thrombolysis and prophylactic CSF drainage have been trialled and not demonstrated to show benefit. Hydrocephalus and rising ICP is an indication for shunting.","notes_hash":"11b4491f4528ccdfb899208dbb2bd69e","knowledge_graph_node_id_link":0,"links":"","media":"","concepts_for_notes":[],"category_name":"Paediatrics","subcategory_name":"","comment_count":1},"",[]]
