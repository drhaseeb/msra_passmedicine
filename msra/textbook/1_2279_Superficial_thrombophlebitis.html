[{"notes_id":"1_2279","category":"1","subcategory":"2","title":"Superficial thrombophlebitis","body":"Superficial thrombophlebitis, as the name suggests describes the inflammation associated with thrombosis of one of the superficial veins, usually the long saphenous vein of the leg. This process is usually non-infective in nature but secondary bacterial infection may rarely occur resulting in septic thrombophlebitis. <br \/><br \/>Around 20% with superficial thrombophlebitis will have an underlying deep vein thrombosis (DVT) at presentation and 3-4% of patients will progress to a DVT if untreated. The risk of DVT is partly linked to the length of vein affected - an inflammed vein > 5 cm is more likely to have an associated DVT.<br \/><br \/><h5 class='notes-heading'>Management<\/h5><br \/>There are currently a variety of treatment approaches to superficial thrombophlebitis. Traditionally NSAIDs have been used, with topical NSAIDs for limited and mild disease and oral NSAIDs for more severe disease.<br \/><br \/>Topical heparinoids have also be used in the management of superficial thrombophlebitis.<br \/><br \/>A Cochrane review however found topical NSAIDs and heparinoids have no significant benefit in terms of reducing extension or progression to DVT. Oral NSAIDs were however shown to reduce the risk of extension by 67%.<br \/><br \/><span class=\"concept\" data-cid=\"11212\">Compression stockings<\/span> are also used. Remember that the ankle-brachial pressure index (ABPI) should be measured before prescribing compression stockings, particularly if using class 2 or above stockings. <br \/><br \/>One of the major changes to the management of superficial thrombophlebitis is the increased use of low-molecular weight heparin. This has been shown to reduce extension and transformation to DVT.
