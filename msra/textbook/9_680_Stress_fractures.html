[{"notes_id":"9_680","category":"6","subcategory":"1","title":"Stress fractures","body":"Repetitive activity and loading of normal bone may result in small hairline fractures. Whilst these may be painful they are seldom displaced. Surrounding soft tissue injury is unusual. They may present late following the injury, in which case callus formation may be identified on radiographs. Such cases may not require formal immobilisation, injuries associated with severe pain and presenting at an earlier stage may benefit from immobilisation tailored to the site of injury.","notes_hash":"b1a78fd47c45eea5bd18d30440f65fa2","knowledge_graph_node_id_link":0,"links":"","media":"","concepts_for_notes":[],"category_name":"Musculoskeletal","subcategory_name":"Orthopaedics","comment_count":0},"",[]]
