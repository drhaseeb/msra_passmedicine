Blood tracks into the medial layer and splits the tissues with the subsequent creation of a false lumen. It most commonly occurs in the ascending aorta or just distal to the left subclavian artery (less common). It is most common in Afro-carribean males aged 50-70 years. <\/li><li>Patients usually present with a tearing intrascapular pain, which may be similar to the pain of a myocardial infarct. <\/li><li>The dissection may spread either proximally or distally with subsequent disruption to the arterial branches that are encountered. <\/li><li>In the Stanford classification system the disease is classified into lesions with a proximal origin (Type A) and those that commence distal to the left subclavian (Type B).<\/li><li>Diagnosis may be suggested by a chest x-ray showing a widened mediastinum. Confirmation of the diagnosis is usually made by use of CT angiography<\/li><li>Proximal (Type A) lesions are usually treated surgically, type B lesions are usually managed non operatively.<\/li><\/ul><br \/><b>Pulmonary embolism<\/b><br \/><ul><li>Typically sudden onset of chest pain, haemoptysis, hypoxia and small pleural effusions may be present. <\/li><li>Most patients will have an underlying deep vein thrombosis<\/li><li>Diagnosis may be suggested by various ECG findings including S waves in lead I, Q waves in lead III and inverted T waves in lead III. Confirmation of the diagnosis is usually made through use of CT pulmonary angiography.<\/li><li>Treatment is with anticoagulation, in those patients who develop a cardiac arrest or severe compromise from their PE, consideration may be given to thrombolysis.<\/li><\/ul><br \/><b>Myocardial infarction<\/b><br \/><ul><li>Traditionally described as sudden onset of central, crushing chest pain. It may radiate into the neck and down the left arm. Signs of autonomic dysfunction may be present. The presenting features may be atypical in the elderly and those with diabetes.<\/li><li>Diagnosis is made through identification of new and usually dynamic ECG changes (and cardiac enzyme changes). Inferior and anterior infarcts may be distinguished by the presence of specific ECG changes (usually II, III and aVF for inferior, leads V1-V5 for anterior).<\/li><li>Treatment is with oral antiplatelet agents, primary coronary angioplasty and\/ or thrombolysis.<\/li><\/ul><br \/><b>Perforated peptic ulcer<\/b><br \/><ul><li>Patients usually develop sudden onset of epigastric abdominal pain, it may be soon followed by generalised abdominal pain.<\/li><li>There may be features of antecendant abdominal discomfort, the pain of gastric ulcer is typically worse immediately after eating.<\/li><li>Diagnosis may be made by erect chest x-ray which may show a small amount of free intra-abdominal air (very large amounts of air are more typically associated with colonic perforation).<\/li><li>Treatment is usually with a laparotomy, small defects may be excised and overlaid with an omental patch, larger defects are best managed with a partial gastrectomy.<\/li><\/ul><br \/><b>Boerhaaves syndrome<\/b><br \/><ul><li>Spontaneous rupture of the oesophagus that occurs as a result of repeated episodes of vomiting.<\/li><li>The rupture is usually distally sited and on the left side.<\/li><li>Patients usually give a history of sudden onset of severe chest pain that may complicate severe vomiting.<\/li><li>Severe sepsis occurs secondary to mediastinitis.<\/li><li>Diagnosis is CT contrast swallow.<\/li><li>Treatment is with thoracotomy and lavage, if less than 12 hours after onset then primary repair is usually feasible, surgery delayed beyond 12 hours is best managed by insertion of a T tube to create a controlled fistula between oesophagus and skin.<\/li><li>Delays beyond 24 hours are associated with a very high mortality rate.<\/li><\/ul>","notes_hash":"29172145afb6f1a35a4288da78565736","knowledge_graph_node_id_link":10003,"links":"","media":"","concepts_for_notes":[],"category_name":"Cardiovascular","subcategory_name":"Cardiology","comment_count":0},"",[]]
