[{"notes_id":"1_1744","category":"11","subcategory":"2","title":"Hyperemesis gravidarum","body":"Whilst the majority of women experience nausea (previously termed 'morning sickness') during the early stages of pregnancy it can become problematic in a minority of cases. The Royal College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists (RCOG) now use the term 'nausea and vomiting of pregnancy' (NVP) to describe troublesome symptoms, with hyperemesis gravidarum being the extreme form of this condition. <br \/><br \/>It occurs in around 1% of pregnancies and is thought to be related to raised beta hCG levels. Hyperemesis gravidarum is most common between 8 and 12 weeks but may persist up to 20 weeks.<br \/><br \/>Risk factors<br \/><ul><li>increased levels of beta-hCG<ul><li><span class=\"concept\" data-cid=\"11620\">multiple pregnancies<\/span><\/li><li><span class=\"concept\" data-cid=\"11621\">trophoblastic disease<\/span><\/li><\/ul><\/li><li>nulliparity<\/li><li>obesity<\/li><li>family or personal history of NVP<\/li><\/ul><br \/><span class=\"concept\" data-cid=\"427\">Smoking is associated with a decreased incidence of hyperemesis<\/span>.<br \/><br \/><br \/><h5 class='notes-heading'>Referral criteria for nausea and vomiting in pregnancy<\/h5><br \/>NICE recommend considering admission in the following situations: #link9 <br \/><ul><li>Continued nausea and vomiting and is unable to keep down liquids or oral antiemetics<\/li><li><span class=\"concept\" data-cid=\"10491\">Continued nausea and vomiting with ketonuria and\/or weight loss (greater than 5% of body weight), despite treatment with oral antiemetics<\/span><\/li><li>A confirmed or suspected comorbidity (for example she is unable to tolerate oral antibiotics for a urinary tract infection)<\/li><\/ul><br \/>They also recommend having a lower threshold for admission to hospital if the woman has a co-existing condition (for example diabetes) that may be adversely affected by nausea and vomiting. <br \/><br \/><br \/><h5 class='notes-heading'>Hyperemesis gravidarum<\/h5><br \/>The Royal College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists (RCOG) recommend that the following <span class=\"concept\" data-cid=\"1162\">triad<\/span> is present before diagnosis of hyperemesis gravidarum: <a href='https:\/\/www.rcog.org.uk\/media\/y3fen1x1\/gtg69-hyperemesis.pdf#page=2' title='Royal College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists - 2016 The Management of Nausea and Vomiting of Pregnancy and Hyperemesis Gravidarum' target='_blank' class='badge rounded-pill text-bg-light deeplink'>RCOG<\/a> <br \/><ul><li>5% pre-pregnancy weight loss<\/li><li>dehydration<\/li><li>electrolyte imbalance<\/li><\/ul><br \/>Other features that may be present<br \/><ul><li>abnormal thyroid function tests -'<span class=\"concept\" data-cid=\"12449\">gestational thyrotoxicosis<\/span>'<ul><li>hyperemesis gravidarum is associated with very high hCG<\/li><li>hCG can weakly stimulate the TSH receptor, leading to a transient thyrotoxic picture.<\/li><li>therefore, TFTs often show: \u2193 TSH, \u2191 free T4 (and sometimes free T3)<\/li><li>usually resolves as hCG levels fall (by ~20 weeks)<\/li><\/ul><\/li><\/ul><br \/>Validated scoring systems such as the <span class=\"concept\" data-cid=\"1161\">Pregnancy-Unique Quantification of Emesis (PUQE)<\/span> score can be used to classify the severity of NVP.<br \/><br \/>Management<br \/><ul><li>simple measures<ul><li>rest and avoid triggers e.g. odours<\/li><li>bland, plain food, particularly in the morning<\/li><li>ginger<\/li><li>P6 (wrist) acupressure<\/li><\/ul><\/li><li><span class=\"concept\" data-cid=\"11619\">first-line medications<\/span> #link7 <ul><li>antihistamines: oral cyclizine or promethazine<\/li><li>phenothiazines: oral prochlorperazine or chlorpromazine<\/li><li>combination drug doxylamine\/pyridoxine: pyridoxine (vitamin B6) monotherapy is actually used commonly outside of the UK as a first-line treatment for NVP.
