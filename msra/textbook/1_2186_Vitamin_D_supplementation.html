[{"notes_id":"1_2186","category":"6","subcategory":"2","title":"Vitamin D supplementation","body":"Vitamin D supplementation has been a hot topic for a number of years now. The muddied waters are now slightly clearer following the release of the following:<br \/><ul><li>2012: letter by the Chief Medical Officer regarding vitamin D supplementation<\/li><li>2013: National Osteoporosis Society (NOS) release UK Vitamin D guideline<\/li><\/ul><br \/>The following groups should be advised to take vitamin D supplementation:<br \/><ul><li>all <span class=\"concept\" data-cid=\"9558\">pregnant<\/span> and breastfeeding women should take a daily supplement containing 10\u00b5g of vitamin D<\/li><li>all children aged 6 months - 5 years. Babies fed with formula milk do not need to take a supplement if they are taking more than 500ml of milk a day, as formula milk is fortified with vitamin D<\/li><li>adults > 65 years<\/li><li>'people who are not exposed to much sun should also take a daily supplement' e.g. <span class=\"concept\" data-cid=\"9554\">housebound patients<\/span><\/li><\/ul><br \/><h5 class='notes-heading'>Testing for vitamin D deficiency<\/h5><br \/>The key message is that not many people warrant a vitamin D test. The NOS guidelines specify that testing may be appropriate in the following situtations:<br \/><ul><li>patients with bone diseases that may be improved with vitamin D treatment e.g. known osteomalacia or Paget's disease<\/li><li>patients with bone diseases, prior to specific treatment where correcting vitamin deficiency is appropriate e,g, prior to intravenous zolendronate or denosumab<\/li><li>patients with musculoskeletal symptoms that could be attributed to vitamin D deficiency e.g. bone pain ?osteomalacia<\/li><\/ul><br \/>Patients with osteoporosis should always be given calcium\/vitamin D supplements so testing is not considered necessary. People who are at higher risk of vitamin D deficiency (see above) should be treated anyway so again testing is not necessary.","notes_hash":"0b4fea7fcb8043d3bd0acad3552cbe6d","knowledge_graph_node_id_link":0,"links":"<table style='width:100%'><tr><td>Chief Medical Officer<\/td><td style = \"float: right;width:115px;\"><button type=\"button\" style=\"\" id=\"link_like_183\" data-linkid=\"183\" data-rating=\"1\" class=\"rate-link btn btn-link\"><svg class=\"bi bi-hand-thumbs-up\" width=\"16\" height=\"16\"><use xlink:href=\"#icon-hand-thumbs-up\"\/><\/svg><\/button><span id=\"link_good_count_183\" class = \"link_good_count\" style=\"color:green; font-size:85%;\">10<\/span><button type=\"button\" style=\"\" id=\"link_dislike_183\" data-linkid=\"183\" data-rating=\"0\" class=\"rate-link btn btn-link\"><svg class=\"bi bi-hand-thumbs-down\" width=\"16\" height=\"16\"><use xlink:href=\"#icon-hand-thumbs-down\"\/><\/svg><\/button><span id=\"link_bad_count_183\" class = \"link_bad_count\" style=\"color:red; font-size:85%;\">6<\/span><\/td><\/tr><tr><td colspan=\"2\"><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https:\/\/www.gov.uk\/government\/uploads\/system\/uploads\/attachment_data\/file\/537616\/SACN_Vitamin_D_and_Health_report.pdf\">2016 Vitamin D guidance<\/a><\/td><\/tr><\/table>","media":"","concepts_for_notes":[],"category_name":"Musculoskeletal","subcategory_name":"Rheumatology","comment_count":3},"",[]]
