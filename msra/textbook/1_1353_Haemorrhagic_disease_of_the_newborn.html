This may result in impaired production of clotting factors which in turn can lead to haemorrhagic disease of the newborn (HDN). Bleeding may range from minor bruising to intracranial haemorrhages<br \/><br \/>Breast-fed babies are particularly at risk as breast milk is a poor source of vitamin K. Maternal use of antiepileptics also increases the risk<br \/><br \/>Because of this, all newborns in the UK are offered vitamin K, either intramuscularly or orally","notes_hash":"994d2b68bedcfcb6b2e703690ec3ca7d","knowledge_graph_node_id_link":0,"links":"","media":"","concepts_for_notes":[],"category_name":"Paediatrics","subcategory_name":"","comment_count":1},"",[]]
