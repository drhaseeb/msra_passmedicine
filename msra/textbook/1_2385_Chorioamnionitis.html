[{"notes_id":"1_2385","category":"11","subcategory":"3","title":"Chorioamnionitis","body":"Chorioamnionitis (which can affect up to 5% of all pregnancies) is a potentially life-threatening condition to both mother and foetus and is therefore considered a medical emergency. It is usually the result of an ascending bacterial infection of the amniotic fluid \/ membranes \/ placenta. The major risk factor in this scenario is the preterm premature rupture of membranes (however, it can still occur when the membranes are still intact) which expose the normally sterile environment of the uterus to potential pathogens. Prompt delivery of the foetus (via cesarean section if necessary) and administration of intravenous antibiotics is widely considered the mainstay of initial treatment for this condition.","notes_hash":"00d68860d6e80a8037f6b3a5ee9d35af","knowledge_graph_node_id_link":0,"links":"","media":"","concepts_for_notes":[],"category_name":"Reproductive","subcategory_name":"Obstetrics","comment_count":2},"",[]]
