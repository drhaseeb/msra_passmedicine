As a result meningococcal B became the most common cause of bacterial meningitis in the UK. A vaccination against meningococcal B (Bexsero) has recently been developed and introduced to the UK market.<br \/><br \/>The Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation (JCVI) initially rejected the use of Bexsero after doing a cost-benefit analysis. This descision was eventually reversed and meningitis B has now been added to the routine NHS immunisation. <br \/><br \/>Three doses are now given at:<br \/><ul><li>2 months<\/li><li>4 months<\/li><li>12-13 months<\/li><\/ul><br \/>Bexsero will also be available on the NHS for patients at high risk of meningococcal disease, such as people with asplenia, splenic dysfunction or complement disorder.","notes_hash":"d882abfa7f20c8b5c2bb1529956a2e14","knowledge_graph_node_id_link":0,"links":"<table style='width:100%'><tr><td>NHS<\/td><td style = \"float: right;width:115px;\"><button type=\"button\" style=\"\" id=\"link_like_1513\" data-linkid=\"1513\" data-rating=\"1\" class=\"rate-link btn btn-link\"><svg class=\"bi bi-hand-thumbs-up\" width=\"16\" height=\"16\"><use xlink:href=\"#icon-hand-thumbs-up\"\/><\/svg><\/button><span id=\"link_good_count_1513\" class = \"link_good_count\" style=\"color:green; font-size:85%;\">6<\/span><button type=\"button\" style=\"\" id=\"link_dislike_1513\" data-linkid=\"1513\" data-rating=\"0\" class=\"rate-link btn btn-link\"><svg class=\"bi bi-hand-thumbs-down\" width=\"16\" height=\"16\"><use xlink:href=\"#icon-hand-thumbs-down\"\/><\/svg><\/button><span id=\"link_bad_count_1513\" class = \"link_bad_count\" style=\"color:red; font-size:85%;\">21<\/span><\/td><\/tr><tr><td colspan=\"2\"><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https:\/\/assets.publishing.service.gov.uk\/government\/uploads\/system\/uploads\/attachment_data\/file\/899422\/PHE_Routine_Childhood_Immunisation_Schedule_Jun2020_03.pdf\">Immunisation Schedule - for doctors<\/a><\/td><\/tr><\/table>","media":"","concepts_for_notes":[],"category_name":"Paediatrics","subcategory_name":"","comment_count":1},"",[]]
