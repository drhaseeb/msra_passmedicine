[{"notes_id":"1_360","category":"5","subcategory":"4","title":"X-linked recessive","body":"In X-linked recessive inheritance only males are affected. An exception to this seen in examinations are patients with Turner's syndrome, who are affected due to only having one X chromosome. X-linked recessive disorders are transmitted by heterozygote females (carriers) and male-to-male transmission is not seen. Affected males can only have unaffected sons and carrier daughters.<br \/><br \/>Each male child of a heterozygous female carrier has a 50% chance of being affected whilst each female child of a heterozygous female carrier has a 50% chance of being a carrier.<br \/><br \/>The possibility of an affected father having children with a heterozygous female carrier is generally speaking extremely rare. However, in certain Afro-Caribbean communities G6PD deficiency is relatively common and homozygous females with clinical manifestations of the enzyme defect are seen.","notes_hash":"23e72410ea6db2225caef8bdc2ef6608","knowledge_graph_node_id_link":0,"links":"","media":"","concepts_for_notes":[],"category_name":"Infectious disease \/ Haematology \/ Immunology","subcategory_name":"Genetics","comment_count":2},"",[]]
