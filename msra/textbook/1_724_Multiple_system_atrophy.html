[{"notes_id":"1_724","category":"9","subcategory":"2","title":"Multiple system atrophy","body":"Multiple System Atrophy (MSA) is a progressive, sporadic, adult-onset neurodegenerative disorder characterised by varying combinations of autonomic failure, parkinsonism, and cerebellar ataxia. It results from widespread neuronal loss and the accumulation of \u03b1-synuclein\u2013containing glial cytoplasmic inclusions within multiple regions of the central nervous system. Shy\u2013Drager syndrome is a historical term referring to MSA with severe and early autonomic failure (now encompassed under the umbrella of MSA).<br \/><br \/>There are 2 predominant types of Multiple System Atrophy (MSA):<br \/><ul><li>1) MSA-P (Parkinsonian type) \u2013 characterised by predominant extrapyramidal features such as bradykinesia and rigidity. It clinically resembles idiopathic Parkinson\u2019s disease but typically has a poorer response to levodopa and earlier development of autonomic dysfunction.<\/li><li>2) MSA-C (Cerebellar type) \u2013 characterised by predominant cerebellar features such as ataxia, dysarthria, and gait disturbance.
