[{"notes_id":"1_1466","category":"11","subcategory":"2","title":"Cervical cancer screening: interpretation of results","body":"The cervical cancer screening programme has undergone a significant evolution in recent years. For many years the smears were examined for signs of dyskaryosis which may indicate cervical intraepithelial neoplasia -  management was based solely on the degree of dyskaryosis. The introduction of HPV testing allowed patients with mild dyskaryosis to be further risk-stratified, i.e. as HPV is such a strong risk factor patients who were HPV negative could be treated as having normal results.<br \/><br \/>The NHS has now moved to an <span class=\"concept\" data-cid=\"11027\"><b>HPV first system<\/b><\/span>, i.e. a sample is tested for high-risk strains of human papillomavirus (hrHPV) first and <span class=\"concept\" data-cid=\"11028\">cytological examination is only performed if this is positive<\/span>.<br \/><br \/><h5 class='notes-heading'>Management of results<\/h5><br \/>Negative hrHPV<br \/><ul><li><span class=\"concept\" data-cid=\"11029\">return to normal recall<\/span>, unless<ul><li>the test of cure (TOC) pathway: individuals who have been treated for CIN1, CIN2, or CIN3 should be invited 6 months after treatment for a test of cure repeat cervical sample in the community<\/li><li>the untreated CIN1 pathway<\/li><li>follow-up for incompletely excised cervical glandular intraepithelial neoplasia (CGIN) \/ stratified mucin producing intraepithelial lesion (SMILE) or cervical cancer<\/li><li>follow-up for borderline changes in endocervical cells<\/li><\/ul><\/li><\/ul><br \/>Positive hrHPV<br \/><ul><li>samples are examined cytologically<\/li><li><span class=\"concept\" data-cid=\"11030\">if the cytology is abnormal &rarr; colposcopy<\/span><ul><li>this includes the following results:<\/li><li>borderline changes in squamous or endocervical cells.<\/li><li>low-grade dyskaryosis.<\/li><li>high-grade dyskaryosis (moderate).<\/li><li>high-grade dyskaryosis (severe).<\/li><li>invasive squamous cell carcinoma.<\/li><li>glandular neoplasia<\/li><\/ul><\/li><li>if the cytology is normal (i.e. hrHPV +ve but cytologically normal) the <span class=\"concept\" data-cid=\"11031\">test is repeated at 12 months<\/span><ul><li>if the repeat test is now hrHPV -ve &rarr; <span class=\"concept\" data-cid=\"11032\">return to normal recall<\/span><\/li><li>if the repeat test is still hrHPV +ve and cytology still normal &rarr; <span class=\"concept\" data-cid=\"11033\">further repeat test 12 months later<\/span>:<\/li><li>If hrHPV -ve at 24 months &rarr; <span class=\"concept\" data-cid=\"11034\">return to normal recall<\/span><\/li><li>if hrHPV +ve at 24 months &rarr; <span class=\"concept\" data-cid=\"11035\">colposcopy<\/span><\/li><\/ul><\/li><\/ul><br \/>If the sample is 'inadequate'<br \/><ul><li><span class=\"concept\" data-cid=\"11036\">repeat the sample in 3 months<\/span><\/li><li><span class=\"concept\" data-cid=\"11037\">if two consecutive inadequate samples then &rarr; colposcopy<\/span><\/li><\/ul><br \/>The follow-up of patients who've previously had CIN is complicated but as a first step, individuals who've been treated for CIN1, CIN2, or CIN3 should be invited 6 months after treatment for a test of cure repeat cervical sample in the community.<br \/><br \/><h5 class='notes-heading'>Treatment of CIN<\/h5><br \/><span class=\"concept\" data-cid=\"11705\">Large loop excision of transformation zone (LLETZ)<\/span> is the most common treatment for cervical intraepithelial neoplasia.
