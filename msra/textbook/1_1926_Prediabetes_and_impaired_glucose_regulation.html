[{"notes_id":"1_1926","category":"3","subcategory":"1","title":"Prediabetes and impaired glucose regulation","body":"Prediabetes is a term which is increasingly used where there is impaired glucose levels which are above the normal range but not high enough for a diagnosis of diabetes mellitus. The term includes patients who have been labelled as having either impaired fasting glucose (IFG) or impaired glucose tolerance (IGT). Diabetes UK estimate that around 1 in 7 adults in the UK have prediabetes. Many individuals with prediabetes will progress on to developing type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) and they are therefore at greater risk of microvascular and macrovascular complications.<br \/><br \/>Terminology<br \/><ul><li>Diabetes UK currently recommend using the term prediabetes when talking to patients and impaired glucose regulation when talking to other healthcare professionals<\/li><li>research has shown that the term 'prediabetes' has the most impact and is most easily understood<\/li><\/ul><br \/>Identification of patients with prediabetes<br \/><ul><li>NICE recommend using a validated computer based risk assessment tool for all adults aged 40 and over, people of South Asian and Chinese descent aged 25-39, and adults with conditions that increase the risk of type 2 diabetes<\/li><li>patients identified at high risk should have a blood sample taken<\/li><li>a fasting plasma glucose of 6.1-6.9 mmol\/l or an HbA1c level of 42-47 mmol\/mol (6.0-6.4%) indicates high risk<\/li><\/ul><br \/><CENTER><table><tr><td align = 'left' colspan='2'><a data-fancybox class='fancybox' rel='group' href='https:\/\/d32xxyeh8kfs8k.cloudfront.net\/images_Passmedicine\/pdd521b.png'><img class='ajaximage' src='https:\/\/d32xxyeh8kfs8k.cloudfront.net\/images_Passmedicine\/pdd521.png'\/><\/a><\/td><\/tr><tr><td valign='top' align='left'><\/td><td align='right'><a data-fancybox class='fancybox lbmagglasslink' rel='group' href='https:\/\/d32xxyeh8kfs8k.cloudfront.net\/images_Passmedicine\/pdd521b.png'><img src='https:\/\/d32xxyeh8kfs8k.cloudfront.net\/css\/images\/mag_glass.png'\/><\/a><\/td><\/tr><\/table><\/CENTER><div class='imagetext'>Diagram showing the spectrum of diabetes diagnosis<br \/><\/div><br \/>Management<br \/><ul><li>lifestyle modification: weight loss, increased exercise, change in diet<\/li><li>at least yearly follow-up with blood tests is recommended<\/li><li>NICE recommend metformin for adults at high risk <i>'whose blood glucose measure (fasting plasma glucose or HbA1c) shows they are still progressing towards type 2 diabetes, despite their participation in an intensive lifestyle-change programme'<\/i><\/li><\/ul><br \/><h5 class='notes-heading'>Impaired fasting glucose and impaired glucose tolerance<\/h5><br \/>There are two main types of IGR:<br \/><ul><li>impaired fasting glucose (IFG) - due to hepatic insulin resistance<\/li><li>impaired glucose tolerance (IGT) - due to muscle insulin resistance<\/li><li>patients with IGT are more likely to develop T2DM and cardiovascular disease than patients with IFG<\/li><\/ul><br \/>Definitions<br \/><ul><li>a fasting glucose greater than or equal to 6.1 but less than 7.0 mmol\/l implies impaired fasting glucose (IFG)<\/li><li>impaired glucose tolerance (IGT) is defined as fasting plasma glucose less than 7.0 mmol\/l and OGTT 2-hour value  greater than or equal to 7.8 mmol\/l but less than 11.1 mmol\/l<\/li><li>people with IFG should then be offered an oral glucose tolerance test to rule out a diagnosis of diabetes.
