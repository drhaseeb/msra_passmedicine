[{"notes_id":"1_1340","category":"7","subcategory":"0","title":"Constipation in children","body":"The frequency at which children open their bowels varies widely but generally decreases with age from a mean of 3 times per day for infants under 6 months old to once a day after 3 years of age.<br \/><br \/>NICE produced guidelines in 2010 on the diagnosis and management of constipation in children. A diagnosis of constipation is suggested by 2 or more of the following:<br \/><br \/><div class=\"table-responsive\"><table class = \"tlarge table table-striped table-bordered\"  data-role=\"table\" id=\"tableid1\" ><thead><tr><th><\/th><th><b>Child < 1 year<\/b><\/th><th><b>Child > 1 year<\/b><\/th><\/tr><\/thead><tbody><tr><td><b>Stool pattern<\/b><\/td><td>Fewer than 3 complete stools per week (type 3 or 4 on Bristol Stool Form Scale) (this does not apply to exclusively breastfed babies after 6 weeks<br \/>of age)<br \/> Hard large stool<br \/> 'Rabbit droppings' (type 1)<\/td><td>Fewer than 3 complete stools per week (type 3 or 4)<br \/> Overflow soiling (commonly very loose, very smelly, stool passed without sensation)<br \/> 'Rabbit droppings' (type 1)<br \/> Large, infrequent stools that can block the toilet<\/td><\/tr><tr><td><b>Symptoms associated with defecation<\/b><\/td><td>Distress on passing stool<br \/> Bleeding associated with hard stool<br \/> Straining<\/td><td>Poor appetite that improves with passage of large stool<br \/> Waxing and waning of abdominal pain with passage of stool<br \/> Evidence of retentive posturing: typical straight-legged, tiptoed, back arching<br \/>posture<br \/> Straining<br \/> Anal pain<\/td><\/tr><tr><td><b>History<\/b><\/td><td>Previous episode(s) of constipation<br \/> Previous or current anal fissure<\/td><td>Previous episode(s) of constipation<br \/> Previous or current anal fissure<br \/> Painful bowel movements and bleeding associated with hard stools<\/td><\/tr><\/tbody><\/table><\/div><br \/>The vast majority of children have no identifiable cause - idiopathic constipation.
