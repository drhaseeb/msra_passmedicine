[{"notes_id":"1_2841","category":"7","subcategory":"0","title":"Erythema infectiosum","body":"Erythema infectiosum (also known as fifth disease or 'slapped-cheek syndrome') is caused by <span class=\"concept\" data-cid=\"10655\">parvovirus B19<\/span>.<br \/><br \/>The illness may consist of a mild feverish illness which is hardly noticeable. However, in others there is a noticeable rash which appears after a few days. The rose-red rash makes the cheeks appear bright red, hence the name '<span class=\"concept\" data-cid=\"12525\">slapped cheek<\/span> syndrome'. The rash may spread to the rest of the body but unlike many other rashes, it only rarely involves the palms and soles.<br \/><br \/>The child begins to feel better as the rash appears and the rash usually peaks after a week and then fades. The rash is unusual in that for some months afterwards, a warm bath, sunlight, heat or fever will trigger a recurrence of the bright red cheeks and the rash itself. Most children recover and need no specific treatment. In adults, the virus may cause acute arthritis.<br \/><br \/>Be aware that the virus can affect an unborn baby in the first 20 weeks of pregnancy. If a woman is exposed early in pregnancy (before 20 weeks) she should seek prompt advice from whoever is giving her antenatal care.<br \/>It is spread by the respiratory route and a person is infectious 3 to 5 days before the appearance of the rash. Children are no longer infectious once the rash appears and there is no specific treatment.<br \/><br \/>The child need not be excluded from school as they are no longer infectious by the time the rash occurs.","notes_hash":"147876538d7611a47cd2c961911dbef4","knowledge_graph_node_id_link":1482,"links":"","media":"<table><tr><td colspan=\"2\"><a href=\"#\" class=\"media_link\" data-url=\"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/embed\/QGikLAy-bqo\" data-description=\"Parvovirus B19\" data-upvotes=\"0\" data-downvotes=\"0\" data-media=\"1125\"><img border=\"0\" class=\"img-thumbnail\" alt=\"YouTube\" src=\"https:\/\/i1.ytimg.com\/vi\/QGikLAy-bqo\/mqdefault.jpg\" style=\"max-width:150px;\"><\/a><\/td><\/tr><tr ><td style=\"padding-top:10px\" colspan=\"2\"><a style=\"\" href=\"#\" class=\"media_link\" data-url=\"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/embed\/QGikLAy-bqo\" data-description=\"Parvovirus B19\" data-upvotes=\"0\" data-downvotes=\"0\" data-media=\"1125\">Parvovirus B19<\/a><\/td><\/tr><tr><td><span ><small>Osmosis - YouTube<\/small><\/span><\/td><td style = \"float: right;width:115px;\"><button type=\"button\" style=\"\" id=\"media_like_1947\" data-mediaid=\"1947\" data-rating=\"1\" class=\"rate-media btn btn-link\"><svg class=\"bi bi-hand-thumbs-up\" width=\"16\" height=\"16\"><use xlink:href=\"#icon-hand-thumbs-up\"\/><\/svg><\/button><span id=\"media_good_count_1947\" class = \"media_good_count\" style=\"color:green; font-size:85%;\">0<\/span><button type=\"button\" style=\"\" id=\"media_dislike_1947\" data-mediaid=\"1947\" data-rating=\"0\" class=\"rate-media btn btn-link\"><svg class=\"bi bi-hand-thumbs-down\" width=\"16\" height=\"16\"><use xlink:href=\"#icon-hand-thumbs-down\"\/><\/svg><\/button><span id=\"media_bad_count_1947\" class = \"media_bad_count\" style=\"color:red; font-size:85%;\">0<\/span><\/td><\/tr><\/table>","concepts_for_notes":{"12525":{"concept_text":"A school-aged child develops mild fever and malaise, followed by a bright red 'slapped-cheek' rash that spreads as a lacy rash over the body --> ? erythema infectiosum","concept_percentile":"97"}},"category_name":"Paediatrics","subcategory_name":"","comment_count":0},"",[]]
