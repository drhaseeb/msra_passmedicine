[{"notes_id":"1_1693","category":"3","subcategory":"2","title":"Hyperlipidaemia: management","body":"In 2014 NICE updated their guidelines on lipid modification. This proved highly controversial as it meant that we should be recommending statins to a significant proportion of the population over the age of 60 years. Anyway, the key points of the new guidelines are summarised below.<br \/><br \/><CENTER><table><tr><td align = 'left' colspan='2'><a data-fancybox class='fancybox' rel='group' href='https:\/\/d32xxyeh8kfs8k.cloudfront.net\/images_Passmedicine\/pdd915b.png'><img class='ajaximage' src='https:\/\/d32xxyeh8kfs8k.cloudfront.net\/images_Passmedicine\/pdd915.png'\/><\/a><\/td><\/tr><tr><td valign='top' align='left'><\/td><td align='right'><a data-fancybox class='fancybox lbmagglasslink' rel='group' href='https:\/\/d32xxyeh8kfs8k.cloudfront.net\/images_Passmedicine\/pdd915b.png'><img src='https:\/\/d32xxyeh8kfs8k.cloudfront.net\/css\/images\/mag_glass.png'\/><\/a><\/td><\/tr><\/table><\/CENTER><div class='imagetext'>Graphic showing choice of statin.<\/div><br \/><h5 class='notes-heading'>Primary prevention - who and how to assess risk<\/h5><br \/>A systematic strategy should be used to identify people aged over 40 years who are likely to be at high risk of cardiovascular disease (CVD), defined as a 10-year risk of <b>10%<\/b> or greater. <br \/><br \/>NICE recommend we use the <b>QRISK2<\/b> CVD risk assessment tool for patients aged <= 84 years. Patients >= 85 years are at high risk of CVD due to their age. QRISK2 should not be used in the following situations as there are more specific guidelines for these patient groups:<br \/><ul><li>type 1 diabetics<\/li><li>patients with an estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) less than 60 ml\/min and\/or albuminuria<\/li><li>patients with a history of familial hyperlipidaemia<\/li><\/ul><br \/>NICE suggest QRISK2 may underestimate CVD risk in the following population groups:<br \/><ul><li>people treated for HIV<\/li><li>people with serious mental health problems<\/li><li>people taking medicines that can cause dyslipidaemia such as antipsychotics, corticosteroids or immunosuppressant drugs<\/li><li>people with autoimmune disorders\/systemic inflammatory disorders such as systemic lupus erythematosus<\/li><\/ul><br \/><br \/><h5 class='notes-heading'>Measuring lipid levels<\/h5><br \/>When measuring lipids both the total cholesterol and HDL should be checked to provide the most accurate risk of CVD. A full lipid profile should also be checked (i.e. including triglycerides) before starting a statin. The samples do not need to be fasting.<br \/><br \/>In the vast majority of patients the cholesterol measurements will be fed into the QRISK2 tool. If however, the patient's cholesterol is very high we should consider familial hyperlipidaemia. NICE recommend the following that we should consider the possibility of familial hypercholesterolaemia and investigate further if:<br \/><ul><li>the total cholesterol level greater than 7.5 mmol\/L and\/or<\/li><li>there is a personal or family history of premature coronary heart disease (an event before 60 years in an index person or first-degree relative [parents, siblings, children])<\/li><\/ul><br \/><br \/><h5 class='notes-heading'>Interpreting the QRISK2 result<\/h5><br \/>Probably the headline change in the 2014 guidelines was the new, lower cut-off of 10-year CVD risk cut-off of 10%. <br \/><br \/><h5 class='notes-heading'>NICE now recommend we offer a statin to people with a QRISK2 10-year risk of >= 10%<\/h5><br \/>Lifestyle factors are of course important and NICE recommend that we give patients the option of having their CVD risk reassessed after a period of time before starting a statin.<br \/><br \/>Atorvastatin 20mg should be offered first-line.<br \/><br \/><br \/><h5 class='notes-heading'>Special situations<\/h5><br \/>Type 1 diabetes mellitus<br \/><ul><li>NICE recommend that we 'consider statin treatment for the primary prevention of CVD in all adults with type 1 diabetes'<\/li><li>atorvastatin 20 mg should be offered if type 1 diabetics who are:<ul><li>older than 40 years, or<\/li><li>have had diabetes for more than 10 years or<\/li><li>have established nephropathy or<\/li><li>have other CVD risk factors<\/li><\/ul><\/li><\/ul><br \/>Chronic kidney disease (CKD)<br \/><ul><li>atorvastatin 20mg should be offered to patients with CKD<\/li><li>increase the dose if a greater than 40% reduction in non-HDL cholesterol is not achieved and the eGFR > 30 ml\/min.
