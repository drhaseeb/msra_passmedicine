[{"notes_id":"1_852","category":"5","subcategory":"2","title":"Iron deficiency anaemia","body":"Iron deficiency anaemia is the most common anaemia worldwide. Iron is needed to make the haemoglobin in red blood cells, therefore a deficiency of iron leads to a reduction in red blood cells\/haemoglobin i.e. anaemia. Iron deficiency anaemia has the highest incidence amongst preschool-age children. The main causes are excessive blood loss, inadequate dietary intake, poor intestinal absorption and increased iron requirements.<br \/><br \/>Epidemiology<br \/><ul><li>Globally, iron deficiency is the most common cause of anaemia<\/li><li>Preschool-age children have the highest prevalence of iron deficiency anaemia<\/li><\/ul><br \/>Causes<br \/><ul><li>Excessive blood loss: blood loss due to menorrhagia is the most common cause in pre-menopausal women, whereas gastrointestinal bleeding is the most common cause in men (always suspect colon cancer) and post-menopausal women. <\/li><li>Inadequate dietary intake: as meat is a good source of iron, vegans and vegetarians are more likely to develop iron deficiency anaemia due to a lack of meat in their diet. However dark green leafy vegetables are another good source of iron, therefore people who don't eat meat can still receive enough iron through purely dietary sources.<\/li><li>Poor intestinal absorption: conditions which affect the small intestine, such as coeliac disease, can prevent sufficient iron being absorbed.<\/li><li>Increased iron requirements: children have increased iron demands during periods of rapid growth. Women also have increased demands during pregnancy as the baby will receive their iron supply from the mother. In addition, an increase in plasma volume during pregnancy causes iron deficiency anaemia through dilution i.e. the proportion of fluid in comparison to red blood cells increases.<\/li><\/ul><br \/>Features<br \/><ul><li>Fatigue<\/li><li>Shortness of breath on exertion<\/li><li>Palpitations<\/li><li>Pallor<\/li><li>Nail changes: this includes <span class=\"concept\" data-cid=\"11748\">koilonychia (spoon-shaped nails)<\/span><\/li><li>Hair loss<\/li><li>Atrophic glossitis<\/li><li>Post-cricoid webs<\/li><li>Angular stomatitis<\/li><\/ul><br \/>Investigations<br \/><ul><li>Taking a history is the most important step in looking for potential causes of iron deficiency. It is useful to inquire about: changes in diet, medication history, menstrual history, weight loss, change in bowel habit<\/li><li>Full blood count (FBC) <i>demonstrates hypochromic microcytic anaemia<\/i><\/li><li>Serum ferritin <i>this will likely be low, as serum ferritin correlates with iron stores. However, it is important to recognise that ferritin can be raised during states of inflammation; so a raised ferritin does not necessarily rule out iron deficiency anaemia if the is co-occurring inflammation. For patients with co-occurring inflammatory disease, other iron studies can be performed. <\/i><\/li><li><span class=\"concept\" data-cid=\"9926\">Total iron-binding capacity (TIBC)\/transferrin <i>this will be high<\/span>. A high TIBC reflects low iron stores. <\/i>.

Post-menopausal women with a haemoglobin level \u226410 and men with a haemoglobin level \u226411 should be referred to a gastroenterologist within 2 weeks. <\/i><\/li><\/ul><br \/>Management<br \/><ul><li>The underlying cause of the iron-deficiency anaemia must be identified and managed.
