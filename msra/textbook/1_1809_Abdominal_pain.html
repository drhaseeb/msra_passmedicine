[{"notes_id":"1_1809","category":"4","subcategory":"3","title":"Abdominal pain","body":"Abdominal pain is a frequent complaint in both outpatient and emergency settings, encompassing a diverse range of conditions from benign to life-threatening. It can be acute or chronic, localised or diffuse. A thorough understanding of the underlying pathophysiological mechanisms and potential causes is crucial for accurate diagnosis and effective management.<br \/><br \/><h5 class='notes-heading'>Background<\/h5><br \/>The abdominal cavity contains various organs including the stomach, liver, gallbladder, spleen, pancreas, kidneys, intestines and reproductive organs. Pain can originate from any of these structures or from the abdominal wall itself. The innervation of these organs is complex and involves somatic and visceral nerves which contribute to the nature and perception of pain.<br \/><br \/><h5 class='notes-heading'>Differential Diagnosis<\/h5><br \/>The table below gives characteristic exam question features for conditions causing abdominal pain.
