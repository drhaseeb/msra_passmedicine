Questions based on a patient's suicide risk are therefore often seen. However, it should be noted that there is a paucity of evidence addressing the positive predictive value of individual risk factors. An interesting review in the BMJ (BMJ 2017;359:j4627) concluded that 'there is no evidence that these assessments can usefully guide decision making' and noted that 50% of suicides occur in patients deemed 'low risk'.<br \/><br \/>Whilst the evidence base is relatively weak, there are a number of factors shown to be associated with an increased risk of suicide<br \/><ul><li><span class=\"concept\" data-cid=\"5737\">male sex<\/span> (hazard ratio (HR) approximately 2.0)<\/li><li><span class=\"concept\" data-cid=\"4620\">history of deliberate self-harm<\/span> (HR 1.7)<\/li><li>alcohol or drug misuse (HR 1.6)<\/li><li>history of mental illness<ul><li>depression<\/li><li>schizophrenia: <span class=\"concept\" data-cid=\"10026\">NICE estimates that 10% of people with schizophrenia will complete suicide<\/span><\/li><\/ul><\/li><li>history of chronic disease<\/li><li>advancing age<\/li><li><span class=\"concept\" data-cid=\"11861\">unemployment<\/span> or social isolation\/living alone<\/li><li>being unmarried, divorced or widowed<\/li><\/ul><br \/>If a patient has actually attempted suicide, there are a number of factors associated with an increased risk of completed suicide at a future date:<br \/><ul><li>efforts to avoid discovery<\/li><li><span class=\"concept\" data-cid=\"12481\">planning<\/span><\/li><li>leaving a written note<\/li><li>final acts such as sorting out finances<\/li><li>violent method<\/li><\/ul><br \/><br \/><br \/><h5 class='notes-heading'>Protective factors<\/h5><br \/>There are, of course, <span class=\"concept\" data-cid=\"10027\">factors which reduce the risk of a patient committing suicide<\/span>.
