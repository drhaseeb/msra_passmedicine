[{"notes_id":"1_269","category":"1","subcategory":"1","title":"Diabetes mellitus: hypertension management","body":"Patient with diabetes mellitus have traditionally had their blood pressure controlled more aggressively to help reduce their overall cardiovascular risk. However, a 2013 Cochrane review cast doubt on the wisdom of lower blood pressure targets for patients with diabetes. It compared patients who had tight blood pressure control (targets < 130\/85 mmHg) with more relaxed control (< 140-160\/90-100 mmHg). Patients who were more tightly controlled had a slightly reduced rate of stroke but otherwise, outcomes were not significantly different.<br \/><br \/>In light of this, NICE recommends a <span class=\"concept\" data-cid=\"604\">blood pressure target of < 140\/90 mmHg for type 2 diabetics<\/span>, the same as for patients without diabetes.<br \/><br \/>For patients with type 1 diabetes, NICE recommends:<br \/><br \/><div class='bs-callout bs-callout-default'><i><br \/>Intervention levels for recommending blood pressure management should be <span class=\"concept\" data-cid=\"10779\">135\/85 mmHg<\/span> unless the adult with type 1 diabetes has albuminuria or 2 or more features of metabolic syndrome, in which case it should be 130\/80 mmHg<br \/><\/i><\/div><br \/>Because <span class=\"concept\" data-cid=\"603\">ACE inhibitors\/or angiotensin-II receptor antagonist (A2RBs)<\/span> have a renoprotective effect in diabetes they are the first-line antihypertensive regardless of age. A2RBs are preferred for black African or African-Caribbean diabetic patients. Further management then reverts to that of non-diabetic patients.<br \/><br \/>Remember that autonomic neuropathy may result in more postural symptoms in patients taking antihypertensive therapy.<br \/><br \/>The routine use of beta-blockers in uncomplicated hypertension should be avoided, particularly when given in combination with thiazides, as they may cause insulin resistance, impair insulin secretion and alter the autonomic response to hypoglycaemia.","notes_hash":"ab49ae44665f6e7947630f3ed4154374","knowledge_graph_node_id_link":10924,"links":"<table style='width:100%'><tr><td>NICE<\/td><td style = \"float: right;width:115px;\"><button type=\"button\" style=\"\" id=\"link_like_1486\" data-linkid=\"1486\" data-rating=\"1\" class=\"rate-link btn btn-link\"><svg class=\"bi bi-hand-thumbs-up\" width=\"16\" height=\"16\"><use xlink:href=\"#icon-hand-thumbs-up\"\/><\/svg><\/button><span id=\"link_good_count_1486\" class = \"link_good_count\" style=\"color:green; font-size:85%;\">13<\/span><button type=\"button\" style=\"\" id=\"link_dislike_1486\" data-linkid=\"1486\" data-rating=\"0\" class=\"rate-link btn btn-link\"><svg class=\"bi bi-hand-thumbs-down\" width=\"16\" height=\"16\"><use xlink:href=\"#icon-hand-thumbs-down\"\/><\/svg><\/button><span id=\"link_bad_count_1486\" class = \"link_bad_count\" style=\"color:red; font-size:85%;\">8<\/span><\/td><\/tr><tr><td colspan=\"2\"><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https:\/\/www.nice.org.uk\/guidance\/ng136\/chapter\/Recommendations\">2019 Hypertension guidelines<\/a><\/td><\/tr><\/table>","media":"","concepts_for_notes":{"603":{"concept_text":"Hypertension in diabetics - ACE inhibitors\/A2RBs are first-line regardless of age","concept_percentile":"56"}},"category_name":"Cardiovascular","subcategory_name":"Cardiology","comment_count":4},"",[]]
