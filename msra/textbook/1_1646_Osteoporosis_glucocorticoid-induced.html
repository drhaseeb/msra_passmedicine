As these drugs are so widely used in clinical practice it is important we manage this risk appropriately. <br \/><br \/>The most widely followed guidelines are based around the 2002 Royal College of Physicians (RCP) 'Glucocorticoid-induced osteoporosis: A concise guide to prevention and treatment'.<br \/><br \/>The risk of osteoporosis is thought to rise significantly once a patient is taking the equivalent of prednisolone 7.5mg a day for 3 or more months. It is important to note that we should manage patients in an anticipatory, i.e. if it likely that the patient will have to take steroids for at least 3 months then we should <span class=\"concept\" data-cid=\"369\">start bone protection straight away<\/span>, rather than waiting until 3 months has elapsed. A good example is a patient with newly diagnosed polymyalgia rheumatica. As it is very likely they will be on a significant dose of prednisolone for greater than 3 months bone protection should be commenced immediately.<br \/><br \/><h5 class='notes-heading'>Management of patients at risk of corticosteroid-induced osteoporosis<\/h5><br \/>The RCP guidelines essentially divide patients into two groups.<br \/><br \/>1. Patients over the age of 65 years or those who've previously had a fragility fracture should be offered bone protection. <br \/><br \/>2. Patients under the age of 65 years should be offered a bone density scan, with further management dependent:<br \/><br \/><div class=\"table-responsive\"><table class = \"tlarge table table-striped table-bordered\"  data-role=\"table\" id=\"tableid1\" ><thead><tr><th>T score<\/th><th>Management<\/th><\/tr><\/thead><tbody><tr><td>Greater than 0<\/td><td>Reassure<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Between 0 and -1.5<\/td><td>Repeat bone density scan in 1-3 years<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Less than -1.5<\/td><td>Offer bone protection<\/td><\/tr><\/tbody><\/table><\/div><br \/>The first-line treatment is alendronate.
