[{"notes_id":"1_2002","category":"6","subcategory":"1","title":"Osteoporosis: assessing risk","body":"We worry about osteoporosis because of the increased risk of fragility fractures. So how do we assess which patients are at risk and need further investigation?<br \/><br \/>NICE produced guidelines in 2012: Osteoporosis: assessing the risk of fragility fracture. The following is based on those guidelines.<br \/><br \/>They advise that all women aged >= 65 years and all men aged >= 75 years should be assessed. Younger patients should be assessed in the presence of risk factors, such as:<br \/><ul><li>previous fragility fracture<\/li><li>current use or frequent recent use of oral or systemic glucocorticoid<\/li><li>history of falls<\/li><li>family history of hip fracture<\/li><li>other causes of secondary osteoporosis, for example:<ul><li>hypogonadism in either sex including low testosterone in men and premature menopause in women<\/li><li>endocrine conditions, including diabetes mellitus, Cushing's disease, hyperthyroidism<\/li><li>conditions associated with malabsorption, including inflammatory bowel disease, coeliac disease, and chronic pancreatitis.<\/li><li>rheumatoid arthritis and other inflammatory arthropathies.<\/li><\/ul><\/li><li>low body mass index (BMI) (less than 18.5 kg\/m\u00b2)<\/li><li>smoking<\/li><li>alcohol intake of more than 14 units per week for women and more than 14 units per week for men.<\/li><\/ul><br \/><br \/><h5 class='notes-heading'>Methods of risk assessment<\/h5><br \/>The first step is to <span class=\"concept\" data-cid=\"12223\">exclude secondary causes<\/span> of osteoporosis as underlying conditions may also require treatment. Examples of secondary causes are listed above.<br \/><br \/>If a patient has had a recent fragility fracture, non-osteoporotic causes should be looked for, for example, bone metastases, myeloma and Paget's disease.<br \/><br \/>A DEXA scan should be offered without calculating the fragilty risk score in the following situations:<br \/><ul><li><span class=\"concept\" data-cid=\"12225\">> 50 years of age with a history of fragility fracture<\/span><\/li><li>< 40 years of age who have a major risk factor for fragility fracture - these patients should be referred to a specialist depending on the T-score<\/li><li>before starting treatments that may have a rapid adverse effect on bone density (for example, sex hormone deprivation for treatment for breast or prostate cancer)<\/li><\/ul><br \/><h6 class='notes-subheading'>Fragility fracture risk score<\/h6><br \/>NICE recommends using a clinical prediction tool such as <span class=\"concept\" data-cid=\"12224\">FRAX or QFracture<\/span> to assess a patient's 10-year risk of developing a fracture. These take into account a number of factors, including the risk factors listed above. This is analogous to the cardiovascular risk tools such as QRISK.<br \/><br \/><h5 class='notes-heading'>Interpreting the results of FRAX<\/h5><br \/>It is important to note though that there is a lot of room for pragmatism and clinical judgement in these guidelines. This reflects the approximate nature of risk scoring and multiple factors that determine fracture risk. <br \/><br \/>QFracture<br \/><ul><li><span class=\"concept\" data-cid=\"12226\">if the 10-year fracture risk is \u2265 10% then a DEXA scan should be arranged<\/span><\/li><\/ul><br \/>FRAX<br \/><ul><li>a colour 'risk' is given by the calculator - green, orange or red<\/li><li>patients in the orange zone should have a DEXA scan if not already done to further refine their 10-year risk<\/li><li>patients in the red zone should also have a DEXA scan if not already done to act as a baseline and guide drug treatment<\/li><\/ul><br \/><h5 class='notes-heading'>When should we reassess a patient's risk?<\/h5><br \/>NICE recommend that we recalculate a patient's risk (i.e. repeat the FRAX\/QFracture):<br \/><div class='bs-callout bs-callout-default'><i><i><br \/><ul><li>if the original calculated risk was in the region of the intervention threshold for a proposed treatment and only after a minimum of 2 years, or<\/li><li>when there has been a change in the person's risk factors<\/li><\/ul><\/i><\/i><\/div>","notes_hash":"b3a31bde9471f572ad41c4cd9c5c228c","knowledge_graph_node_id_link":10843,"links":"<table style='width:100%'><tr><td>NICE<\/td><td style = \"float: right;width:115px;\"><button type=\"button\" style=\"\" id=\"link_like_103\" data-linkid=\"103\" data-rating=\"1\" class=\"rate-link btn btn-link\"><svg class=\"bi bi-hand-thumbs-up\" width=\"16\" height=\"16\"><use xlink:href=\"#icon-hand-thumbs-up\"\/><\/svg><\/button><span id=\"link_good_count_103\" class = \"link_good_count\" style=\"color:green; font-size:85%;\">7<\/span><button type=\"button\" style=\"\" id=\"link_dislike_103\" data-linkid=\"103\" data-rating=\"0\" class=\"rate-link btn btn-link\"><svg class=\"bi bi-hand-thumbs-down\" width=\"16\" height=\"16\"><use xlink:href=\"#icon-hand-thumbs-down\"\/><\/svg><\/button><span id=\"link_bad_count_103\" class = \"link_bad_count\" style=\"color:red; font-size:85%;\">11<\/span><\/td><\/tr><tr><td colspan=\"2\"><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https:\/\/www.nice.org.uk\/guidance\/CG146\/chapter\/1-Guidance\">2012 Osteoporosis: assessing the risk of fragility fracture<\/a><\/td><\/tr><\/table><br><br><table style='width:100%'><tr><td>Royal College of Physicians<\/td><td style = \"float: right;width:115px;\"><button type=\"button\" style=\"\" id=\"link_like_607\" data-linkid=\"607\" data-rating=\"1\" class=\"rate-link btn btn-link\"><svg class=\"bi bi-hand-thumbs-up\" width=\"16\" height=\"16\"><use xlink:href=\"#icon-hand-thumbs-up\"\/><\/svg><\/button><span id=\"link_good_count_607\" class = \"link_good_count\" style=\"color:green; font-size:85%;\">9<\/span><button type=\"button\" style=\"\" id=\"link_dislike_607\" data-linkid=\"607\" data-rating=\"0\" class=\"rate-link btn btn-link\"><svg class=\"bi bi-hand-thumbs-down\" width=\"16\" height=\"16\"><use xlink:href=\"#icon-hand-thumbs-down\"\/><\/svg><\/button><span id=\"link_bad_count_607\" class = \"link_bad_count\" style=\"color:red; font-size:85%;\">9<\/span><\/td><\/tr><tr><td colspan=\"2\"><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https:\/\/www.rcpjournals.org\/content\/clinmedicine\/16\/Suppl_6\/s121\">2012 Recent advances in the risk assessment and treatment of osteoporosis<\/a><\/td><\/tr><\/table>","media":"","concepts_for_notes":[],"category_name":"Musculoskeletal","subcategory_name":"Orthopaedics","comment_count":5},"",[]]
