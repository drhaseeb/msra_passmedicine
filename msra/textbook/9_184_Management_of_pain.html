Analgesia from peripherally acting drugs may be additive to that from centrally-acting opioids and thus, the two are given together. <\/li><\/ul><br \/>The World Federation of Societies of Anaesthesiologists (WFSA) Analgesic Ladder<br \/><ul><li>For management of acute pain<\/li><li>Initially, the pain can be expected to be severe and may need controlling with strong analgesics in combination with local anaesthetic blocks and peripherally acting drugs.  <\/li><li>The second rung on the postoperative pain ladder is the restoration of the use of the oral route to deliver analgesia. Strong opioids may no longer be required and adequate analgesia can be obtained by using combinations of peripherally acting agents and weak opioids. <\/li><li>The final step is when the pain can be controlled by peripherally acting agents alone.  <\/li><\/ul><br \/>Local anaesthetics<br \/><ul><li>Infiltration of a wound with a long-acting local anaesthetic such as Bupivacaine<\/li><li>Analgesia for several hours<\/li><li>Further pain relief can be obtained with repeat injections or by infusions via a thin catheter<\/li><li>Blockade of plexuses or peripheral nerves will provide selective analgesia in those parts of the body supplied by the plexus or nerves<\/li><li>Can either be used to provide anaesthesia for the surgery or specifically for postoperative pain relief<\/li><li>Especially useful where a sympathetic block is needed to improve postoperative blood supply or where central blockade such as spinal or epidural blockade is contraindicated. <\/li><\/ul><br \/><h5 class='notes-heading'>Spinal anaesthesia<\/h5><br \/>Provides excellent analgesia for surgery in the lower half of the body and pain relief can last many hours after completion of the operation if long-acting drugs containing vasoconstrictors are used. <br \/><br \/>Side effects of spinal anaesthesia include: hypotension, sensory and motor block, nausea and <span class=\"concept\" data-cid=\"12350\">urinary retention<\/span>. <br \/><br \/><h5 class='notes-heading'>Epidural anaesthesia<\/h5><br \/>An indwelling epidural catheter is inserted. This can then be used to provide a continuous infusion of analgesic agents. It can provide excellent analgesia. They are still the <span class=\"concept\" data-cid=\"1924\">preferred option following major open abdominal procedures<\/span> and help prevent postoperative respiratory compromise resulting from pain.<br \/><br \/>Disadvantages of epidurals are that they usually confine patients to bed, especially if a motor block is present. In addition, an indwelling urinary catheter is required. Which may not only impair mobility but also serve as a conduit for infection. <span class=\"concept\" data-cid=\"9174\">Epidural haematoma<\/span> is a recognised complication. They are contraindicated in coagulopathies.<br \/><br \/><h5 class='notes-heading'>Transversus Abdominal Plane block (TAP)<\/h5><br \/>In this technique, an ultrasound is used to identify the correct muscle plane and local anaesthetic (usually bupivicaine) is injected. The agent diffuses in the plane and blocks many of the spinal nerves. It is an attractive technique as it provides a wide field of blockade but does not require the placement of any indwelling devices. There is no post-operative motor impairment. For this reason, it is the preferred technique when extensive laparoscopic abdominal procedures are performed. They will then provide analgesia immediately following surgery but as they do not confine the patient to bed, the focus on enhanced recovery can begin sooner. <br \/><br \/>The main disadvantage is that their duration of action is limited to the half-life of the local anaesthetic agent chosen. In addition, some anaesthetists do not have the USS skills required to site the injections.<br \/><br \/><h5 class='notes-heading'>Patient Controlled Analgesia (PCA)<\/h5> <br \/>Patients administer their own intravenous analgesia and titrate the dose to their own end-point of pain relief using a small microprocessor - controlled pump. Morphine is the most popular drug used.<br \/><br \/><br \/><h5 class='notes-heading'>Opioids<\/h5>  <br \/>Morphine<br \/><ul><li>Short half-life and poor bioavailability. <\/li><li>Metabolised in the liver and clearance is reduced in patients with liver disease, in the elderly and the debilitated<\/li><li>Side effects include nausea, vomiting, constipation and respiratory depression. <\/li><li>Tolerance may occur with repeated dosage <\/li><\/ul><br \/>Pethidine<br \/><ul><li>Synthetic opioid which is structurally different from morphine but which has similar actions. Has 10% potency of morphine.<\/li><li>Short half life and similar bioavailability and clearance to morphine. <\/li><li>Short duration of action and may need to be given hourly. <\/li><li>Pethidine has a toxic metabolite (norpethidine) which is cleared by the kidney, but which accumulates in renal failure or following frequent and prolonged doses and may lead to muscle twitching and convulsions. Extreme caution is advised if pethidine is used over a prolonged period or in patients with renal failure. <\/li><\/ul><br \/>Codeine<br \/><ul><li>markedly less active than morphine, has predictable effects when given orally and is effective against mild to moderate pain. <\/li><\/ul><br \/><h5 class='notes-heading'>Non opioid analgesics<\/h5><br \/>Paracetamol<br \/><ul><li>Inhibits prostaglandin synthesis.  <\/li><li>Analgesic and antipyretic properties but has little anti-inflammatory effect<\/li><li>It is well absorbed orally and is metabolised almost entirely in the liver<\/li><li>Side effects in normal dosage and is widely used for the treatment of minor pain.
