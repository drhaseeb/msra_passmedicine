[{"notes_id":"1_2277","category":"11","subcategory":"1","title":"Contraception for women aged > 40 years","body":"Whilst fertility has usually significantly declined by the age of 40 years women still require effective contraception until the menopause. The Faculty of Sexual and Reproductive Healthcare (FSRH) have produced specific guidance looking at this age group - 'Contraception for Women Aged Over 40 Years' - a link is provided below.<br \/><br \/><h5 class='notes-heading'>Specific methods<\/h5><br \/>No method of contraception is contraindicated by age alone. All methods are UKMEC1 except for the combined oral contraceptive pill (UKMEC2 for women >= 40 years) and Depo-Provera (UKMEC2 for women > 45 years). The guidance issued by the FSRH contained a number of points which should be considered about each method:<br \/><br \/>Combined oral contraceptive pill (COCP)<br \/><ul><li>COCP use in the perimenopausal period may help to maintain bone mineral density<\/li><li>COCP use may help reduce menopausal symptoms<\/li><li>a pill containing < 30 \u00b5g ethinylestradiol may be more suitable for women > 40 years<\/li><\/ul><br \/>Depo-Provera<br \/><ul><li>women should be advised there may be a delay in the return of fertility of up to 1 year for women > 40 years<\/li><li>use is associated with a small loss in bone mineral density which is usually recovered after discontinuation<\/li><\/ul><br \/><h5 class='notes-heading'>Stopping contraception<\/h5><br \/>The FSRH have produced a useful table detailing how the different methods may be stopped. Please follow the link for the full table.<br \/><br \/><div class=\"table-responsive\"><table class = \"tlarge table table-striped table-bordered\"  data-role=\"table\" id=\"tableid1\" ><thead><tr><th>Method<\/th><th>Women < 50 years<\/th><th>Women >= 50 years<\/th><\/tr><\/thead><tbody><tr><td>Non-hormonal (e.g. IUD, condoms, natural family planning)<\/td><td>Stop contraception after 2 years of amenorrhoea<\/td><td>Stop contraception after 1 year of amenorrhoea<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>COCP<\/td><td>Can be continued to 50 years<\/td><td>Switch to non-hormonal or progestogen-only method<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Depo-Provera<\/td><td>Can be continued to 50 years<\/td><td>Switch to either a non-hormonal method and stop after 2 years of amenorrhoea OR switch to a progestogen-only method and follow advice below<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Implant, POP, IUS<\/td><td>Can be continued beyond 50 years<\/td><td>Continue<br \/><br \/>If amenorrhoeic check FSH and stop after 1 year if FSH >= 30u\/l or stop at 55 years<br \/><br \/>If not amenorrhoeic consider investigating abnormal bleeding pattern<\/td><\/tr><\/tbody><\/table><\/div><br \/><h5 class='notes-heading'>Hormone Replacement Therapy and Contraception<\/h5><br \/>As we know hormone replacement therapy (HRT) cannot be relied upon for contraception so a separate method of contraception is needed. The FSRH advises that the POP may be be used with in conjunction with HRT as long as the HRT has a progestogen component (i.e. the POP cannot be relied upon to 'protect' the endometrium). In contrast the IUS is licensed to provide the progestogen component of HRT.","notes_hash":"f6efd105f4b5eacc0bcf5b6d0c4ea51b","knowledge_graph_node_id_link":0,"links":"<table style='width:100%'><tr><td>Faculty of Sexual and Reproductive Healthcare<\/td><td style = \"float: right;width:115px;\"><button type=\"button\" style=\"\" id=\"link_like_469\" data-linkid=\"469\" data-rating=\"1\" class=\"rate-link btn btn-link\"><svg class=\"bi bi-hand-thumbs-up\" width=\"16\" height=\"16\"><use xlink:href=\"#icon-hand-thumbs-up\"\/><\/svg><\/button><span id=\"link_good_count_469\" class = \"link_good_count\" style=\"color:green; font-size:85%;\">5<\/span><button type=\"button\" style=\"\" id=\"link_dislike_469\" data-linkid=\"469\" data-rating=\"0\" class=\"rate-link btn btn-link\"><svg class=\"bi bi-hand-thumbs-down\" width=\"16\" height=\"16\"><use xlink:href=\"#icon-hand-thumbs-down\"\/><\/svg><\/button><span id=\"link_bad_count_469\" class = \"link_bad_count\" style=\"color:red; font-size:85%;\">2<\/span><\/td><\/tr><tr><td colspan=\"2\"><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https:\/\/www.fsrh.org\/standards-and-guidance\/documents\/fsrh-guidance-contraception-for-women-aged-over-40-years-2017\/\">Contraception for Women Aged Over 40 Years<\/a><\/td><\/tr><\/table>","media":"","concepts_for_notes":[],"category_name":"Reproductive","subcategory_name":"Contraception","comment_count":4},"",[]]
