In the UK it is given to high-risk infants. Until 2005 it was also routinely given to children at the age of 13 years. <br \/><br \/>The Greenbook currently advises that the vaccine is administered to the following groups (below is summary, please see the link for more details):<br \/><ul><li>all infants (aged 0 to 12 months) living in areas of the UK where the annual incidence of TB is 40\/100,000 or greater<\/li><li>all infants (aged 0 to 12 months) with a parent or grandparent who was born in a country where the annual incidence of TB is 40\/100,000 or greater. The same applies to older children but if they are 6 years old or older they require a tuberculin skin test first<\/li><li>previously unvaccinated tuberculin-negative contacts of cases of respiratory TB <\/li><li>previously unvaccinated, tuberculin-negative new entrants under 16 years of age who were born in or who have lived for a prolonged period (at least three months) in a country with an annual TB incidence of 40\/100,000 or greater<\/li><li>healthcare workers<\/li><li>prison staff<\/li><li>staff of care home for the elderly<\/li><li>those who work with homeless people<\/li><\/ul><br \/>The vaccine contains live attenuated Mycobacterium bovis.
