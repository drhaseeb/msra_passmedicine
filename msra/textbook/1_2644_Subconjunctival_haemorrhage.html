[{"notes_id":"1_2644","category":"2","subcategory":"3","title":"Subconjunctival haemorrhage","body":"Subconjunctival haemorrhages result from the bleeding of blood vessels into the subconjunctival space. The vessels that bleed are usually the ones responsible for supplying the conjunctiva or episclera.  The cause is most commonly traumatic followed by spontaneous idiopathic cases, Valsalva manoeuvres and several systemic diseases. Subconjunctival haemorrhages can look dramatic and cause worry to patients, however they are rarely an indicator of anything sinister.<br \/><br \/><h5 class='notes-heading'>Epidemiology:<\/h5><br \/><ul><li>Subconjunctival haemorrhages are more common in women than in men when there has been no history of trauma<\/li><li>The annual incidence of non-traumatic subconjunctival haemorrhages is 0.6%, the risk increases with age as the risk factors are more common in elderly patients.
