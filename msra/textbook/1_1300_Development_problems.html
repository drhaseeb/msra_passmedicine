It is crucial for clinicians to identify and address these delays promptly to improve long-term outcomes.<br \/><br \/><br \/><h5 class='notes-heading'>Background<\/h5><br \/>The process of normal child development is complex and multifaceted, encompassing the maturation of various systems such as motor skills (gross and fine), language (expressive and receptive), cognitive abilities, and adaptive behaviours. Any disruption in this intricate process can lead to abnormal development. The root cause may be genetic disorders, prenatal exposure to toxins\/drugs\/alcohol, premature birth, nutritional deficiencies or environmental factors.<br \/><br \/><br \/><h5 class='notes-heading'>Example issues<\/h5><br \/>Referral points<br \/><ul><li>doesn't smile at 10 weeks<\/li><li>cannot sit unsupported at 12 months<\/li><li>cannot walk at 18 months<\/li><\/ul><br \/>Fine motor skill problems<br \/><ul><li>hand preference before 12 months is abnormal and may indicate cerebral palsy<\/li><\/ul><br \/>Gross motor problems<br \/><ul><li>most common causes of problems: variant of normal, cerebral palsy and neuromuscular disorders (e.g. Duchenne muscular dystrophy)<\/li><\/ul><br \/>Speech and language problems<br \/><ul><li>always check hearing<\/li><li>other causes include environmental deprivation and general development delay<\/li><\/ul><br \/><h5 class='notes-heading'>Differential Diagnosis<\/h5><br \/>The differential diagnosis for developmental delay is broad; however, some common causes include:<br \/><br \/><ul><li><b>Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD)<\/b>: Characterised by impairments in social interaction and communication alongside restricted interests and repetitive behaviours.<\/li><li><b>Cerebral Palsy:<\/b> A group of permanent movement disorders appearing in early childhood due to abnormal brain development or damage.<\/li><li><b>Fragile X Syndrome:<\/b> A genetic condition causing intellectual disability, behavioural challenges and various physical characteristics.<\/li><li><b>Down Syndrome:<\/b> A chromosomal disorder leading to intellectual disability and characteristic facial features.<\/li><li><b>Fetal Alcohol Spectrum Disorders (FASDs):<\/b> A range of effects that can occur in an individual exposed to alcohol before birth.<\/li><\/ul><br \/><h5 class='notes-heading'>Initial Management<\/h5><br \/>The initial management of a child with suspected developmental delay involves the following steps:<br \/><br \/><ul><li><b>Clinical Examination:<\/b> A thorough physical and neurological examination to assess the child's developmental milestones.<\/li><li><b>Investigations:<\/b> These may include genetic testing, metabolic screening, neuroimaging studies (MRI or CT scan), and hearing\/vision assessments.<\/li><li><b>Referral for Specialist Assessment:<\/b> If a specific cause is suspected, referral to a paediatric neurologist, geneticist or developmental paediatrician may be necessary.<\/li><li><b>Early Intervention Services:<\/b> Regardless of the underlying cause, all children with developmental delays can benefit from early intervention services such as occupational therapy, speech and language therapy, physiotherapy and educational support.<\/li><\/ul>","notes_hash":"adcefb7d367ce09a84ddc40d84638d6a","knowledge_graph_node_id_link":11154,"links":"","media":"","concepts_for_notes":[],"category_name":"Paediatrics","subcategory_name":"","comment_count":3},"",[]]
