[{"notes_id":"1_427","category":"5","subcategory":"2","title":"Paraproteinaemia","body":"Paraproteinaemia is a haematological condition characterized by the abnormal overproduction of a single type of immunoglobulin or immunoglobulin fragment, referred to as a paraprotein or M-protein. The increased production of paraprotein is commonly associated with monoclonal gammopathies, a group of disorders arising from the clonal expansion of plasma cells or B-lymphocytes.<br \/><br \/>Paraproteinaemia can be classified into benign and malignant forms based on the underlying cause.<br \/><br \/>Benign paraproteinaemia:<br \/><ul><li>Monoclonal gammopathy of undetermined significance (MGUS)<\/li><li>Transient paraproteinaemia (e.g., following an infection)<\/li><\/ul><br \/>Malignant paraproteinaemia:<br \/><ul><li>Multiple myeloma<\/li><li>Waldenstrom macroglobulinemia<\/li><li>Primary amyloidosis (AL)<\/li><li>B-cell lymphoproliferative disorders (e.g., chronic lymphocytic leukaemia, non-Hodgkin lymphoma)<\/li><\/ul><br \/>Clinical features<br \/><ul><li>Hyperviscosity syndrome<\/li><li>Neuropathy (e.g., sensory, motor, or autonomic dysfunction)<\/li><li>Renal dysfunction<\/li><li>Hematologic abnormalities (e.g anaemia, thrombocytopenia, or leukopenia)<\/li><li>Bone pain or pathologic fractures (in the context of multiple myeloma)<\/li><\/ul>","notes_hash":"c0ec6159a228797706bddcb0e6ce98a9","knowledge_graph_node_id_link":0,"links":"","media":"","concepts_for_notes":[],"category_name":"Infectious disease \/ Haematology \/ Immunology","subcategory_name":"Haematology","comment_count":0},"",[]]
