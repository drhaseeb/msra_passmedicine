[{"notes_id":"1_1994","category":"1","subcategory":"1","title":"Myocardial infarction: complications","body":"Patients are at risk of a number of immediate, early and late complications following a myocardial infarction (MI).<br \/><br \/><h5 class='notes-heading'>Cardiac arrest<\/h5><br \/>This most commonly occurs due to patients developing ventricular fibrillation and is the most common cause of death following a MI. Patients are managed as per the ALS protocol with defibrillation.<br \/><br \/><h5 class='notes-heading'>Cardiogenic shock<\/h5><br \/>If a large part of the ventricular myocardium is damaged in the infarction the ejection fraction of the heart may decrease to the point that the patient develops cardiogenic shock. This is difficult to treat. Other causes of cardiogenic shock include the 'mechanical' complications such as left ventricular free wall rupture as listed below. Patients may require inotropic support and\/or an intra-aortic balloon pump.<br \/><br \/><h5 class='notes-heading'>Chronic heart failure<\/h5><br \/>As described above, if the patient survives the acute phase their ventricular myocardium may be dysfunctional resulting in chronic heart failure. Loop diuretics such as furosemide will decrease fluid overload. Both ACE-inhibitors and beta-blockers have been shown to improve the long-term prognosis of patients with chronic heart failure.<br \/><br \/><h5 class='notes-heading'>Tachyarrhythmias<\/h5><br \/><span class=\"concept\" data-cid=\"6891\">Ventricular fibrillation<\/span>, as mentioned above, is the most common cause of death following a MI. Other common arrhythmias including ventricular tachycardia.<br \/><br \/><h5 class='notes-heading'>Bradyarrhythmias<\/h5><br \/>Atrioventricular block is more common following <span class=\"concept\" data-cid=\"7726\">inferior myocardial infarctions<\/span>.<br \/><br \/><h5 class='notes-heading'>Pericarditis<\/h5><br \/><span class=\"concept\" data-cid=\"4052\">Pericarditis in the first 48 hours following a transmural MI is common<\/span> (c. 10% of patients). The pain is typical for pericarditis (worse on lying flat etc), a pericardial rub may be heard and a pericardial effusion may be demonstrated with an echocardiogram.<br \/><br \/><span class=\"concept\" data-cid=\"6892\">Dressler's syndrome<\/span> tends to occur around <span class=\"concept\" data-cid=\"1868\">2-6 weeks<\/span> following a MI. The underlying pathophysiology is thought to be an autoimmune reaction against antigenic proteins formed as the myocardium recovers. It is characterised by a combination of <span class=\"concept\" data-cid=\"6897\">fever<\/span>, <span class=\"concept\" data-cid=\"6898\">pleuritic pain<\/span>, pericardial effusion and a raised ESR. It is treated with NSAIDs.<br \/><br \/><span class=\"concept\" data-cid=\"6893\"><h5 class='notes-heading'>Left ventricular aneurysm<\/h5><\/span><br \/><br \/>The ischaemic damage sustained may weaken the myocardium resulting in aneurysm formation. This is typically associated with <span class=\"concept\" data-cid=\"6900\">persistent ST elevation<\/span> and left ventricular failure. Thrombus may form within the aneurysm increasing the risk of stroke. Patients are therefore anticoagulated.<br \/><br \/><div class=\"container\"><div class=\"row\"><div class=\"col-md-3\"><a href=\"https:\/\/d32xxyeh8kfs8k.cloudfront.net\/images_Passmedicine\/ecg095b.png\" data-fancybox=\"gallery\" data-caption=\"Left ventricular aneurysm.

Patients present with acute heart failure secondary to cardiac tamponade (<span class=\"concept\" data-cid=\"6899\">raised JVP, pulsus paradoxus<\/span>, diminished heart sounds). Urgent pericardiocentesis and thoracotomy are required.<br \/><br \/><span class=\"concept\" data-cid=\"6895\"><h5 class='notes-heading'>Ventricular septal defect<\/h5><\/span><br \/><br \/>Rupture of the interventricular septum usually occurs in the first week and is seen in around 1-2% of patients. Features: acute heart failure associated with a pan-systolic murmur. An echocardiogram is diagnostic and will exclude acute mitral regurgitation which presents in a similar fashion. Urgent surgical correction is needed.<br \/><br \/><h5 class='notes-heading'>Acute mitral regurgitation<\/h5><br \/>More common with infero-posterior infarction and may be due to <span class=\"concept\" data-cid=\"5382\">ischaemia or rupture of the papillary muscle<\/span>. Acute hypotension and <span class=\"concept\" data-cid=\"9166\">pulmonary oedema<\/span> may occur. An early-to-mid systolic murmur is typically heard. Patients are treated with vasodilator therapy but often require emergency surgical repair.","notes_hash":"5683d376eef16e9a6a9598d1113aa6e7","knowledge_graph_node_id_link":0,"links":"<table style='width:100%'><tr><td>European Society of Cardiology<\/td><td style = \"float: right;width:115px;\"><button type=\"button\" style=\"\" id=\"link_like_1300\" data-linkid=\"1300\" data-rating=\"1\" class=\"rate-link btn btn-link\"><svg class=\"bi bi-hand-thumbs-up\" width=\"16\" height=\"16\"><use xlink:href=\"#icon-hand-thumbs-up\"\/><\/svg><\/button><span id=\"link_good_count_1300\" class = \"link_good_count\" style=\"color:green; font-size:85%;\">53<\/span><button type=\"button\" style=\"\" id=\"link_dislike_1300\" data-linkid=\"1300\" data-rating=\"0\" class=\"rate-link btn btn-link\"><svg class=\"bi bi-hand-thumbs-down\" width=\"16\" height=\"16\"><use xlink:href=\"#icon-hand-thumbs-down\"\/><\/svg><\/button><span id=\"link_bad_count_1300\" class = \"link_bad_count\" style=\"color:red; font-size:85%;\">30<\/span><\/td><\/tr><tr><td colspan=\"2\"><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https:\/\/www.escardio.org\/static_file\/Escardio\/Guidelines\/2017%20STEMI%20ehx393_web%20addenda%20-%20FOR%20WEB.pdf\">2017 ESC Guidelines for the management of acute myocardial infarction in patients presenting with ST-segment elevation<\/a><\/td><\/tr><\/table>","media":"","concepts_for_notes":{"5382":{"concept_text":"Rupture of the papillary muscle due to a myocardial infarction --> acute mitral regurgitation --> widespread systolic murmur, hypotension, pulmonary oedema","concept_percentile":"60"},"6891":{"concept_text":"A man develops a cardiac arrest shortly after being admitted with a myocardial infarction.
