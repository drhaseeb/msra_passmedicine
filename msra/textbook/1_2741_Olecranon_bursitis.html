[{"notes_id":"1_2741","category":"6","subcategory":"1","title":"Olecranon bursitis","body":"Olecranon bursitis describes inflammation of the fluid-filled bursa overlying the olecranon process at the proximal ulna. The bursa reduces friction between the elbow and overlying tissues. It may be caused by trauma, infection, or systemic inflammatory conditions such as gout or rheumatoid arthritis. Also referred to as 'student's elbow', it often results from repetitive leaning on hard surfaces.
