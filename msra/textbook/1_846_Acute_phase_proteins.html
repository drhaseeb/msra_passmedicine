CRP is a protein synthesised in the liver and binds to phosphocholine in bacterial cells and on those cells undergoing apoptosis. In binding to these cells it is then able to activate the complement system. CRP levels are known to rise in patients following surgery. However, levels of greater than 150 at 48 hours post operatively are suggestive of evolving complications.<br \/><br \/>**plays a more significant role in other mammals such as mice","notes_hash":"3952e6c01291236481709a90bf6fd027","knowledge_graph_node_id_link":0,"links":"","media":"","concepts_for_notes":[],"category_name":"Endocrinology \/ Metabolic","subcategory_name":"Metabolic","comment_count":2},"",[]]
