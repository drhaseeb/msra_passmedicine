[{"notes_id":"1_2242","category":"12","subcategory":"0","title":"Asthma: stepping down treatment","body":"The British Thoracic Society (BTS) guidelines recommend that we should consider stepping down treatment every 3 months or so. The guidelines don't advocate a strict move from say step 3 to step 2 but advise us to take into account duration of treatment, side-effects and patient preference.<br \/><br \/>When reducing the dose of inhaled steroids the BTS advise us to do this by 25-50% at a time.<br \/><br \/>Clearly patients with stable asthma may only have a formal review on an annual basis but it is likely that if a patient has recently had an escalation of asthma treatment they would be reviewed on a more frequent basis.","notes_hash":"b82af58fd27a97e752463672a332fb95","knowledge_graph_node_id_link":11377,"links":"","media":"","concepts_for_notes":[],"category_name":"Respiratory","subcategory_name":"","comment_count":0},"",[]]
