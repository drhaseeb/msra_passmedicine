[{"notes_id":"1_2862","category":"10","subcategory":"2","title":"Priapism","body":"Priapism is a persistent penile erection, typically defined as lasting longer than 4 hours and is not associated with sexual stimulation.  Priapism can be described as either ischaemic or non-ischaemic with both categories having a different pathophysiology.  Ischaemic priapism is typically due to impaired vasorelaxation and therefore reduced vascular outflow resulting in congestion and trapping of de-oxygenated blood within the corpus cavernosa. Non-ischaemic priapism is due to high arterial inflow, typically due to fistula formation often either as the result of congenital or traumatic mechanisms.<br \/><br \/>Epidemiology<br \/><ul><li>Age at presentation has a bimodal distribution, with peaks between 5-10 years and 20-50 years of age<\/li><li>incidence has been estimated at up to 5.34 per 100,000 patient-years<\/li><\/ul><br \/>Causes<br \/><ul><li>Idiopathic<\/li><li>Sickle cell disease or other haemoglobinopathies<\/li><li>Erectile dysfunction medication (e.g. Sildenafil and other PDE-5 inhibitors), this also includes intracavernosal injected therapies.<\/li><li>Other drugs both prescribed (anti-hypertensives, anticoagulants, antidepressants etc) and recreational (specifically cocaine, cannabis and ecstasy).<\/li><li>Trauma<\/li><\/ul><br \/>Patients typically present acutely with:<br \/><ul><li>A persistent erection lasting over 4 hours<\/li><li>Pain localised to the penis<\/li><li>Often a history of either known haemoglobinopathy or use of medications listed above<\/li><li>Patients may, more rarely, present with either a non-painful erection or an erection that is not fully rigid: these are both suggestive of non-ischaemic priapism.<\/li><li>History of trauma to the genital or perineal region: also suggestive of non-ischaemic priapism.<\/li><\/ul><br \/><br \/>Investigations:<br \/><ul><li><span class=\"concept\" data-cid=\"9680\">Cavernosal blood gas analysis<\/span> to differentiate between ischaemic and non-ischaemic: <i>in ischaemic priapism pO2 and pH would be reduced whilst pCO2 would be increased.<\/i><\/li><li>Doppler or duplex ultrasonography: this can be used as an alternative to blood gas analysis to assess for blood flow within the penis.<\/li><li>A full blood count and toxicology screen can be used to assess for an underlying cause of the priapism.<\/li><li>Diagnosis of priapism is largely clinical, with investigations helping to categorise into ischaemic and non-ischaemic as well as assessing for the underlying cause.<\/li><\/ul><br \/><h5 class='notes-heading'>Management<\/h5><br \/>Ischaemic priapism is a <span class=\"concept\" data-cid=\"9047\">medical emergency<\/span> and delayed treatment can lead to permanent tissue damage and long-term erectile dysfunction. <br \/><ul><li>If the priapism has lasted longer than 4 hours, the first-line treatment is aspiration of blood from the cavernosa, this is often combined with injection of a saline flush to help clear viscous blood that has pooled.<\/li><li>If aspiration and injection fails, then <span class=\"concept\" data-cid=\"12382\">intracavernosal injection of a vasoconstrictive agent such as phenylephrine<\/span> is used and repeated at 5 minute intervals.<\/li><li>If medical therapy fails then surgical options can be considered.<\/li><\/ul><br \/>Non-ischaemic priapism is not a medical emergency and is normally suitable for observation as a first-line option.","notes_hash":"28ca35a6390b7ceb4454a0ac1208c78d","knowledge_graph_node_id_link":0,"links":"","media":"","concepts_for_notes":{"9680":{"concept_text":"Cavernosal blood gas analysis is a useful investigation for priapism","concept_percentile":"57"}},"category_name":"Renal \/ Urology","subcategory_name":"Urology","comment_count":1},"",[]]
