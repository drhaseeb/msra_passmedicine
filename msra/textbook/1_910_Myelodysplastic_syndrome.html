[{"notes_id":"1_910","category":"5","subcategory":"2","title":"Myelodysplastic syndrome","body":"Myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS) encompass a heterogeneous group of clonal hematopoietic stem cell disorders characterized by ineffective hematopoiesis, peripheral blood cytopenias, and a <span class=\"concept\" data-cid=\"2975\">risk of progression to acute myeloid leukaemia (AML)<\/span>. These disorders predominantly affect older adults, with a median age at diagnosis of 70-75 years.<br \/><br \/><b>Aetiology and Pathophysiology<\/b><br \/><br \/>MDS arises from genetic mutations in hematopoietic stem cells. <br \/><br \/>Around 90% of cases are primary with the remaining 10% secondary to causes such as chemotherapy and radiotherapy. <span class=\"concept\" data-cid=\"12069\">Secondary MDS typically develops around 5 years post-treatment<\/span>.<br \/><br \/>The key pathophysiological feature of MDS is ineffective hematopoiesis leading to peripheral cytopenias despite a typically hypercellular bone marrow. The exact mechanisms are still not entirely understood, but they likely involve a combination of increased apoptosis, abnormal differentiation, and immune dysregulation.<br \/><br \/><b>Clinical Features<\/b><br \/><br \/>MDS can present with various symptoms related to the underlying cytopenias. Common presentations include fatigue, weakness, and pallor due to anaemia; recurrent infections due to neutropenia; and easy bruising or bleeding due to thrombocytopenia. Some patients may be asymptomatic and are diagnosed incidentally on routine blood counts.<br \/><br \/><b>Diagnosis<\/b><br \/><br \/>The diagnosis of MDS is based on peripheral blood counts, bone marrow examination, and cytogenetic analysis. Bone marrow biopsy typically shows dysplastic changes in hematopoietic cells and a varying degree of blasts. Cytogenetic analysis can identify specific chromosomal abnormalities that may have prognostic implications.<br \/><br \/><b>Treatment<\/b><br \/><br \/>Treatment of MDS depends on the subtype of MDS, the patient's age and overall health, and the severity of symptoms. Options include supportive care (e.g., blood transfusions, growth factors), disease-modifying therapy (e.g., hypomethylating agents, lenalidomide), immunosuppressive therapy, and hematopoietic stem cell transplantation. The latter is the only potentially curative option but is limited by the patient's age and comorbidities.","notes_hash":"3bfb0a83216ee3a23fcbe98c367cd964","knowledge_graph_node_id_link":1466,"links":"","media":"<table><tr><td colspan=\"2\"><a href=\"#\" class=\"media_link\" data-url=\"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/embed\/fT_NTuZSbkQ\" data-description=\"Myelodysplastic syndromes\" data-upvotes=\"1\" data-downvotes=\"0\" data-media=\"1048\"><img border=\"0\" class=\"img-thumbnail\" alt=\"YouTube\" src=\"https:\/\/i1.ytimg.com\/vi\/fT_NTuZSbkQ\/mqdefault.jpg\" style=\"max-width:150px;\"><\/a><\/td><\/tr><tr ><td style=\"padding-top:10px\" colspan=\"2\"><a style=\"\" href=\"#\" class=\"media_link\" data-url=\"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/embed\/fT_NTuZSbkQ\" data-description=\"Myelodysplastic syndromes\" data-upvotes=\"1\" data-downvotes=\"0\" data-media=\"1048\">Myelodysplastic syndromes<\/a><\/td><\/tr><tr><td><span ><small>Osmosis - YouTube<\/small><\/span><\/td><td style = \"float: right;width:115px;\"><button type=\"button\" style=\"\" id=\"media_like_1832\" data-mediaid=\"1832\" data-rating=\"1\" class=\"rate-media btn btn-link\"><svg class=\"bi bi-hand-thumbs-up\" width=\"16\" height=\"16\"><use xlink:href=\"#icon-hand-thumbs-up\"\/><\/svg><\/button><span id=\"media_good_count_1832\" class = \"media_good_count\" style=\"color:green; font-size:85%;\">1<\/span><button type=\"button\" style=\"\" id=\"media_dislike_1832\" data-mediaid=\"1832\" data-rating=\"0\" class=\"rate-media btn btn-link\"><svg class=\"bi bi-hand-thumbs-down\" width=\"16\" height=\"16\"><use xlink:href=\"#icon-hand-thumbs-down\"\/><\/svg><\/button><span id=\"media_bad_count_1832\" class = \"media_bad_count\" style=\"color:red; font-size:85%;\">0<\/span><\/td><\/tr><\/table>","concepts_for_notes":{"2975":{"concept_text":"Myelodysplasia may progress to acute myeloid leukaemia","concept_percentile":"99"}},"category_name":"Infectious disease \/ Haematology \/ Immunology","subcategory_name":"Haematology","comment_count":0},"",[]]
