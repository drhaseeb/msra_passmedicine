[{"notes_id":"9_295","category":"4","subcategory":"3","title":"Organ Transplant","body":"A number of different organ and tissue transplants are now available. In many cases an allograft is performed, where an organ is transplanted from one individual to another. Allografts will elicit an immune response and this is one of the main reasons for organ rejection. <br \/><br \/>Graft rejection occurs because allografts have allelic differences at genes that code immunohistocompatability complex genes. The main antigens that give rise to rejection are:<br \/><ul><li>ABO blood group<\/li><li>Human leucocyte antigens (HLA)<\/li><li>Minor histocompatability antigens<\/li><\/ul><br \/><b>ABO Matching<\/b><br \/>ABO incompatibility will result in early organ rejection (hyperacute) because of pre existing antibodies to other groups. Group O donors can give organs to any type of ABO recipient whereas group AB donor can only donate to AB recipient.<br \/><br \/><b>HLA System<\/b><br \/>The four most important HLA alleles are:  <br \/><br \/><ul><li>HLA A<\/li><li>HLA B<\/li><li>HLA C<\/li><li>HLA DR<\/li><\/ul><br \/>An ideal organ match would be one in which all 8 alleles are matched (remember 2 from each parent, four each = 8 alleles). Modern immunosuppressive regimes help to manage the potential rejection due to HLA mismatching. However, the greater the number of mismatches the worse the long term outcome will be. T lymphocytes will recognise antigens bound to HLA molecules and then will then become activated. Clonal expansion then occurs with a response directed against that antigen. <br \/><br \/><b>Types of organ rejection<\/b><br \/><ul><li>Hyperacute. This occurs immediately through presence of pre formed antigens (such as ABO incompatibility).<\/li><li>Acute. Occurs during the first 6 months and is usually T cell mediated. Usually tissue infiltrates and vascular lesions.<\/li><li>Chronic. Occurs after the first 6 months. Vascular changes predominate. <\/li><\/ul><br \/><b>Hyperacute<\/b><br \/>Renal transplants at greatest risk and liver transplants at least risk. Although ABO incompatibility and HLA Class I incompatible transplants will all fare worse in long term. <br \/><br \/><b>Acute<\/b><br \/>All organs may undergo acute rejection. Mononuclear cell infiltrates predominate. All types of transplanted organ are susceptible and it may occur in up to 50% cases. <br \/><br \/><b>Chronic<\/b><br \/>Again all transplants with HLA mismatch may suffer this fate. Previous acute rejections and other immunosensitising events all increase the risk. Vascular changes are most prominent with myointimal proliferation leading to organ ischaemia. Organ specific changes are also seen such as loss of acinar cells in pancreas transplants and rapidly progressive coronary artery disease in cardiac transplants.<br \/><br \/><br \/><b>Surgical overview-Renal transplantation<\/b><br \/>A brief overview of the steps involved in renal transplantation is given. <br \/>Patients with end stage renal failure who are dialysis dependent or likely to become so in the immediate future are considered for transplant. Exclusion criteria include; active malignancy, old age (due to limited organ availability). Patients are medically optimised. <br \/>Donor kidneys, these may be taken from live related donors and close family, members may have less HLA mismatch than members of the general population. Laparoscopic donor nephrectomy further minimises the operative morbidity for the donor. Other organs are typically taken from brain dead or dying patients who have a cardiac arrest and in whom resuscitation is futile. The key event is to minimise the warm ischaemic time in the donor phase. <br \/><br \/>The kidney once removed is usually prepared on the bench in theatre by the transplant surgeon immediately prior to implantation and factors such as accessory renal arteries and vessel length are assessed and managed.<br \/><br \/>For first time recipients the operation is performed under general anaesthesia. A Rutherford-Morrison incision is made on the preferred side. This provides excellent extraperitoneal access to the iliac vessels. The external iliac artery and vein are dissected out and following systemic heparinisation are cross clamped. The vein and artery are anastamosed to the iliacs and the clamps removed. The ureter is then implanted into the bladder and a stent is usually placed to maintain patency. The wounds are then closed and the patient recovered from surgery. <br \/><br \/>In the immediate phase a common problem encountered in cadaveric kidneys is acute tubular necrosis and this tends to resolve. <br \/><br \/>Graft survival times from cadaveric donors are typically of the order of 9 years and monozygotic twin transplant (live donor) may survive as long as 25 years.","notes_hash":"4ffadfa1e0d00e2f3551a70c73df5795","knowledge_graph_node_id_link":0,"links":"","media":"<table><tr><td colspan=\"2\"><a href=\"#\" class=\"media_link\" data-url=\"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/embed\/0y1UOq7EIMg\" data-description=\"Grafting, Organ Transplants and Immunosuppression\" data-upvotes=\"4\" data-downvotes=\"0\" data-media=\"717\"><img border=\"0\" class=\"img-thumbnail\" alt=\"YouTube\" src=\"https:\/\/i1.ytimg.com\/vi\/0y1UOq7EIMg\/mqdefault.jpg\" style=\"max-width:150px;\"><\/a><\/td><\/tr><tr ><td style=\"padding-top:10px\" colspan=\"2\"><a style=\"\" href=\"#\" class=\"media_link\" data-url=\"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/embed\/0y1UOq7EIMg\" data-description=\"Grafting, Organ Transplants and Immunosuppression\" data-upvotes=\"4\" data-downvotes=\"0\" data-media=\"717\">Grafting, Organ Transplants and Immunosuppression<\/a><\/td><\/tr><tr><td><span ><small>AK lecture - YouTube<\/small><\/span><\/td><td style = \"float: right;width:115px;\"><button type=\"button\" style=\"\" id=\"media_like_1252\" data-mediaid=\"1252\" data-rating=\"1\" class=\"rate-media btn btn-link\"><svg class=\"bi bi-hand-thumbs-up\" width=\"16\" height=\"16\"><use xlink:href=\"#icon-hand-thumbs-up\"\/><\/svg><\/button><span id=\"media_good_count_1252\" class = \"media_good_count\" style=\"color:green; font-size:85%;\">4<\/span><button type=\"button\" style=\"\" id=\"media_dislike_1252\" data-mediaid=\"1252\" data-rating=\"0\" class=\"rate-media btn btn-link\"><svg class=\"bi bi-hand-thumbs-down\" width=\"16\" height=\"16\"><use xlink:href=\"#icon-hand-thumbs-down\"\/><\/svg><\/button><span id=\"media_bad_count_1252\" class = \"media_bad_count\" style=\"color:red; font-size:85%;\">0<\/span><\/td><\/tr><\/table>","concepts_for_notes":[],"category_name":"Gastroenterology \/ Nutrition","subcategory_name":"General surgery","comment_count":1},"",[]]
