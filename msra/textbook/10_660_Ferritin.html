Falsely elevated results may therefore be encountered clinically and need to be taken in the context of the clinical picture and blood results.<br \/><br \/>We can split the causes of increased ferritin levels into 2 distinct categories;<br \/><br \/><div class=\"table-responsive\"><table class = \"tlarge table table-striped table-bordered\"  data-role=\"table\" id=\"tableid1\" ><thead><tr><th>Without iron overload (around 90% of patients)<\/th><th>With iron overload (around 10% of patients)<\/th><\/tr><\/thead><tbody><tr><td>Inflammation (due to ferritin being an acute phase reactant)<br \/>Alcohol excess<br \/>Liver disease<br \/>Chronic kidney disease<br \/>Malignancy<\/td><td>Primary iron overload (hereditary haemochromatosis)<br \/><br \/>Secondary iron overload (e.g. following repeated transfusions)<\/td><\/tr><\/tbody><\/table><\/div><br \/>The best test to see whether iron overload is present is <b>transferrin saturation<\/b>.
