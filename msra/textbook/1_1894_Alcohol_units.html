[{"notes_id":"1_1894","category":"9","subcategory":"1","title":"Alcohol: units","body":"In 2016 the Chief Medical Officer proposed new guidelines in relation to the safe consumption of alcohol following an expert group report. The most significant change has been a reduction in the number of units it is recommending men do not exceed from 21 to 14, in line with the recommendations for women.<br \/><br \/>The government now recommend the following:<br \/><ul><li>men <b>and<\/b> women should drink no more than 14 units of alcohol per week<\/li><li>they advise <i>'if you do drink as much as 14 units per week, it is best to spread this evenly over 3 days or more'<\/i><\/li><li>pregnant women should not drink. The wording of the official advice is '<i>If you are pregnant or planning a pregnancy, the safest approach is not to drink alcohol at all, to keep risks to your baby to a minimum. Drinking in pregnancy can lead to long-term harm to the baby, with the more you drink the greater the risk.<\/i>'<\/li><\/ul><br \/>One unit of alcohol is equal to 10 mL of pure ethanol. The 'strength' of an alcoholic drink is determined by the 'alcohol by volume' (ABV).<br \/><br \/>Examples of one unit of alcohol:<br \/><ul><li>25ml single measure of spirits (ABV 40%)<\/li><li>a third of a pint of beer (ABV 5 to 6%)<\/li><li>half a 175ml 'standard' glass of red wine (ABV 12%)<\/li><\/ul><br \/>To calculate the number of units in a drink multiply the number of millilitres by the ABV and divide by 1,000. For example:<br \/><ul><li>half a 175ml 'standard' glass of red wine = 87.5 * 12 \/ 1000 = 1.05 units<\/li><li>one bottle of wine = 750 * 12 \/ 1000 = 9 units<\/li><li>one pint of 5% beer or lager = 568 * 5 \/ 1000 = 2.8 units<\/li><\/ul>","notes_hash":"66eff73c73a92d6935372a62157f7a03","knowledge_graph_node_id_link":0,"links":"<table style='width:100%'><tr><td>Gov.uk<\/td><td style = \"float: right;width:115px;\"><button type=\"button\" style=\"\" id=\"link_like_750\" data-linkid=\"750\" data-rating=\"1\" class=\"rate-link btn btn-link\"><svg class=\"bi bi-hand-thumbs-up\" width=\"16\" height=\"16\"><use xlink:href=\"#icon-hand-thumbs-up\"\/><\/svg><\/button><span id=\"link_good_count_750\" class = \"link_good_count\" style=\"color:green; font-size:85%;\">7<\/span><button type=\"button\" style=\"\" id=\"link_dislike_750\" data-linkid=\"750\" data-rating=\"0\" class=\"rate-link btn btn-link\"><svg class=\"bi bi-hand-thumbs-down\" width=\"16\" height=\"16\"><use xlink:href=\"#icon-hand-thumbs-down\"\/><\/svg><\/button><span id=\"link_bad_count_750\" class = \"link_bad_count\" style=\"color:red; font-size:85%;\">11<\/span><\/td><\/tr><tr><td colspan=\"2\"><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https:\/\/www.gov.uk\/government\/uploads\/system\/uploads\/attachment_data\/file\/489795\/summary.pdf\">2016 Alcohol guidelines review<\/a><\/td><\/tr><\/table>","media":"","concepts_for_notes":[],"category_name":"Psychiatry \/ Neurology","subcategory_name":"Psychiatry","comment_count":5},"",[]]
