They state that you must respect the wishes of any patient who objects to particular information being shared within the healthcare team or with others. This must stand unless disclosure would be justified in the public interest. <br \/><br \/>If a patient objects to a disclosure, which is considered essential to the provision of safe care, you should explain that you cannot refer them or otherwise arrange for their treatment without also disclosing that information.<br \/><br \/>In this example disclosure is vitally important in identifying the cause of her recurrent urinary tract infections. Thus it must be mentioned. However doing this without her consent would be bad practice and against GMC guidence. <br \/><br \/>Thus we must accept her request and make the referral obtaining her consent to share the information, if possible.","notes_hash":"7d9cb8a63ddacb4382bf112ff31ca96d","knowledge_graph_node_id_link":0,"links":"","media":"","concepts_for_notes":[],"category_name":"All","subcategory_name":"","comment_count":0},"",[]]
