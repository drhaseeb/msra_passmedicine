[{"notes_id":"1_2812","category":"1","subcategory":"0","title":"GMC: Financial and commercial arrangements and conflicts of interest","body":"Honesty and openness are the two overriding principles outlined by the GMC when dealing with financial arrangements and conflicts of interest as a doctor. The main points covered by this guidance are:<br \/><ul><li>You must be honest in all financial and commercial dealings<\/li><li>You must never allow any personal interests to affect the way that you prescribe, treat, refer or commission services for patients<\/li><li>If you are faced with a conflict of interest, you must immediately declare your interest formally and be prepared to exclude yourself from the decision-making <\/li><li>You must never ask for or accept any gift (monetary or otherwise) that may affect or be seen to affect the way you prescribe for or treat your patients <\/li><\/ul><br \/><h5 class='notes-heading'> Financial Arrangements <\/h5><br \/>If in your career you ever charge fees for your service (for example in private practice) you must ensure that you make your patients aware of the fees that you charge before seeking their consent to treatment and you must also make them aware if any part of these fees get paid to another healthcare professional. <br \/><br \/>Some public health services, such as vaccinations and screening, have clear benefits for both individual patients and for wider society. For providing these services, general practitioners receive fees from the government, with the aim to increase uptake. This is part of the <b> Quality and Outcomes Framework (QOF). <\/b> Whilst it is important to encourage patients to take up these services for their own health and wellbeing, you must never put pressure on patients to participate because of the financial benefits to you. <br \/><br \/>As a prescriber working within the NHS, you may occasionally see messages regarding the cost-effectiveness of certain medications. Whilst it is important to safeguard NHS money by not prescribing expensive treatments unnecessarily, the patient's safety and health is always most important. <br \/><br \/><h5 class='notes-heading'> Conflicts of Interest <\/h5><br \/>Trust in the doctor-patient relationship is essential and you should therefore not act in any way to compromise this trust. Trust may be especially compromised if your personal interests affect or are seen to affect your professional judgement. All doctors should:<br \/><ul><li>use their professional judgement to identify conflicts of interest when they arise<\/li><li>avoid conflicts of interest wherever possible<\/li><li>declare any conflicts that arise formally and as early as possible to everyone involved<\/li><li>ensure that the conflict does not affect their decisions about patient care <\/li><\/ul><br \/>One example of when a conflict of interest may arise is if there are several referral options for a patient and you as a clinician have a financial interest in one of the services that you could refer the patient to. This may be a medical devices company, pharmacy, dispensary, nursing or care home or secondary care institute. If this situation were to arise, you would have a duty to inform the patient of your conflict of interest and also to ensure that this interest did not affect the way that you referred the patient. The best decision must always be made for the patient, regardless of your personal interests, and if you feel that your conflict of interest makes it difficult for you to make this decision, the decision should be made by someone else.","notes_hash":"90a97ce7b607b6709b6a5414f43cb2b1","knowledge_graph_node_id_link":0,"links":"<table style='width:100%'><tr><td>GMC<\/td><td style = \"float: right;width:115px;\"><button type=\"button\" style=\"\" id=\"link_like_1428\" data-linkid=\"1428\" data-rating=\"1\" class=\"rate-link btn btn-link\"><svg class=\"bi bi-hand-thumbs-up\" width=\"16\" height=\"16\"><use xlink:href=\"#icon-hand-thumbs-up\"\/><\/svg><\/button><span id=\"link_good_count_1428\" class = \"link_good_count\" style=\"color:green; font-size:85%;\">0<\/span><button type=\"button\" style=\"\" id=\"link_dislike_1428\" data-linkid=\"1428\" data-rating=\"0\" class=\"rate-link btn btn-link\"><svg class=\"bi bi-hand-thumbs-down\" width=\"16\" height=\"16\"><use xlink:href=\"#icon-hand-thumbs-down\"\/><\/svg><\/button><span id=\"link_bad_count_1428\" class = \"link_bad_count\" style=\"color:red; font-size:85%;\">0<\/span><\/td><\/tr><tr><td colspan=\"2\"><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https:\/\/www.gmc-uk.org\/ethical-guidance\/ethical-guidance-for-doctors\/financial-and-commercial-arrangements-and-conflicts-of-interest\">Financial and commercial arrangements and conflicts of interest<\/a><\/td><\/tr><\/table>","media":"","concepts_for_notes":[],"category_name":"All","subcategory_name":"","comment_count":0},"",[]]
