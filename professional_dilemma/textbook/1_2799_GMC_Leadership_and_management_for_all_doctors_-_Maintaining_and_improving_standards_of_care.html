[{"notes_id":"1_2799","category":"1","subcategory":"0","title":"GMC: Leadership and management for all doctors - Maintaining and improving standards of care","body":"The GMC has produced a document 'Leadership and Management for All Doctors'. This document describes the role of a doctor beyond clinical medicine. It also details the expectations surrounding being a leader or manager (clinical director or educational supervisor) i.e. 'doctors with extra responsibilities' in the workplace. It also describes the expectations surrounding employment, performance revalidation and resource management.<br \/><br \/>We will summarise the chapter on 'Maintaining and improving standards of care'. The GMC recommends that doctors regularly reflect, review, update and revalidate their practice. The GMC has also specifically mentioned the importance of information governance. <br \/><br \/><b> Reflection <\/b> <br \/><br \/>The GMC encourages all doctors to routinely reflect on their work, performance, contribution and professional values. It is recommended that all doctors seek feedback from colleagues and patients. For instance, peer appraisals, performance reviews and audit results. Feedback from patients in the form of comments or complaints also should be sought after. Those with additional responsibilities need to create a culture and a system in which all staff can provide constructive feedback. <br \/><br \/><b> Ensuring high standards of care <\/b> <br \/><br \/>Patient care and safety should be prioritised. Therefore, any issues regarding the quality of care need to be recognised early and resolved. To this end, GMC expects all doctors to participate in audits or performance reviews. All doctors must comply with the trust guidelines and know when and how to report clinical incidents and near misses. Completing an incident form helps to identify and solve any problems, and reduces the risk of a similar incident happening in the future. <br \/><br \/>Doctors in the managing role need to ensure that there are systems in place to review the quality of care. For instance, through audit or feedback forms, clinical outcomes and patient experiences are collected and reviewed. <br \/><br \/><b> Performance review and revalidation <\/b> <br \/><br \/>All doctors must participate in annual appraisals, which evaluate their clinical and non-clinical roles. Revalidation is necessary for any doctors holding a GMC license to practice. Appraisals must be genuine and objective, and should only be filled in by senior doctors with the appropriate skills. Making false comments about one's competence could put patients' safety at risk. When appraising an academic staff, Follet principles need to be observed.<br \/><br \/><b> Keeping up to date <\/b> <br \/><br \/>All doctors must update their clinical and non-clinical knowledge and skills. For instance, reviewing the latest guidelines. They must observe the relevant laws and statutory codes of practice. <br \/><br \/><b> Information governance <\/b> <br \/><br \/>Accurate documentation of clinical and non-clinical details need to be carried out accurately. Records should not be made retrospectively. Patients need to know how information is kept and used. Throughout, patient confidentiality and privacy need to be maintained. All patient records must be handled according to the data protection law","notes_hash":"dcb2668fa5a823028523511412b4a844","knowledge_graph_node_id_link":0,"links":"<table style='width:100%'><tr><td>GMC<\/td><td style = \"float: right;width:115px;\"><button type=\"button\" style=\"\" id=\"link_like_1405\" data-linkid=\"1405\" data-rating=\"1\" class=\"rate-link btn btn-link\"><svg class=\"bi bi-hand-thumbs-up\" width=\"16\" height=\"16\"><use xlink:href=\"#icon-hand-thumbs-up\"\/><\/svg><\/button><span id=\"link_good_count_1405\" class = \"link_good_count\" style=\"color:green; font-size:85%;\">0<\/span><button type=\"button\" style=\"\" id=\"link_dislike_1405\" data-linkid=\"1405\" data-rating=\"0\" class=\"rate-link btn btn-link\"><svg class=\"bi bi-hand-thumbs-down\" width=\"16\" height=\"16\"><use xlink:href=\"#icon-hand-thumbs-down\"\/><\/svg><\/button><span id=\"link_bad_count_1405\" class = \"link_bad_count\" style=\"color:red; font-size:85%;\">0<\/span><\/td><\/tr><tr><td colspan=\"2\"><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https:\/\/www.gmc-uk.org\/ethical-guidance\/ethical-guidance-for-doctors\/leadership-and-management-for-all-doctors\/maintaining-and-improving-standards-of-care\">GMC: Leadership and management for all doctors - Maintaining and improving standards of care links<\/a><\/td><\/tr><\/table>","media":"","concepts_for_notes":[],"category_name":"All","subcategory_name":"","comment_count":0},"",[]]
