[{"notes_id":"1_2781","category":"1","subcategory":"0","title":"GMC: Good medical practice - Knowledge skills and performance","body":"The GMC exists to protect patients and so the principle of its guidance here is that you must ensure your knowledge, skills and performance are at a standard that will keep the patients under your care safe.<br \/><br \/><h5 class='notes-heading'>Develop and maintain your professional performance<\/h5><br \/>Not only must you be competent in your job, but you are also obliged to keep yourself up to date so that you remain able to perform your role safely and effectively. This will include formal Continuing Professional Development (CPD) activities. The Academy of Medical Royal Colleges recommends 50 hours of credited CPD as a minimum, and this is required for revalidation, but this is not alone sufficient.<br \/><br \/>You also monitor and improve the quality of your work. This means auditing your own practice and acting on the results of the audits is essential. For example, a surgeon should audit their rates of post-operative complications such as infection. If they find these are high, they must find out why and act to reduce the rates of complications.<br \/><br \/>Another way in which professional performance is improved is through reflective practice. Trainees often maintain an e-portfolio which they use to consider events which have gone well and badly and try to understand how to improve their practice in the future through careful personal reflection.<br \/><br \/><h5 class='notes-heading'>Apply knowledge and experience to practice<\/h5><br \/>The key message here is to recognise and work within the limits of your own competence, following guidance where applicable and seeking senior help when necessary.<br \/><br \/>You are obliged to provide good quality care. What constitutes good quality care has been determined in case law. The <span class=\"concept\" data-cid=\"11670\">Bolam test<\/span> requires that your practice must be in line with a reasonable body of professional opinion, that is other doctors would have done the same in the same position. This has been updated with the Bolitho test which also requires that the body of professional opinion not be unreasonable or illogical.<br \/><br \/>Conforming to guidelines is useful as it allows your practice to better reflect the current best evidence on which these guidelines are usually based. It is also useful from a medicolegal perspective however, as being able to demonstrate you followed established guidance automatically demonstrates that your practice was in line with a reasonable body of professional opinion, thereby passing the Bolam test.<br \/><br \/><h5 class='notes-heading'>Record keeping<\/h5><br \/>You must keep clear and accurate records, which are made as soon as possible after the events took place. These records should contain relevant clinical information and must state who made them.<br \/><br \/>From a medicolegal standpoint, these notes represent the definitive record of what took place during the care of the patient. If something is not documented, it is regarded to have not taken place. If you imagine the scenario of an epilepsy clinic, there are a number of examples: <br \/><ul><li>Documenting that a patient has been told not to drive could be extremely important if that patient is subsequently involved in a road traffic accident, as they may claim that they haven't been informed of their risk.<\/li><li>A female patient started on anti-epileptic medication must have been told about the potential teratogenicity of the treatment and the importance of contraception. If she were to have a child with birth defects and it was not documented that the patient was informed, the potential liability could be enormous.<\/li><\/ul><br \/>You must also hold these documents securely, as they will contain sensitive personal information. This is effectively an extension of your responsibility to provide patient confidentiality. An example of a common mistake is leaving a smart card in a computer without having logged out. This potentially puts patient confidentiality at risk by leaving their computerised records insecure and easily accessible by unauthorised persons.","notes_hash":"d0e2f583a24316c87fef3ce778c2a92c","knowledge_graph_node_id_link":0,"links":"<table style='width:100%'><tr><td>GMC<\/td><td style = \"float: right;width:115px;\"><button type=\"button\" style=\"\" id=\"link_like_1388\" data-linkid=\"1388\" data-rating=\"1\" class=\"rate-link btn btn-link\"><svg class=\"bi bi-hand-thumbs-up\" width=\"16\" height=\"16\"><use xlink:href=\"#icon-hand-thumbs-up\"\/><\/svg><\/button><span id=\"link_good_count_1388\" class = \"link_good_count\" style=\"color:green; font-size:85%;\">0<\/span><button type=\"button\" style=\"\" id=\"link_dislike_1388\" data-linkid=\"1388\" data-rating=\"0\" class=\"rate-link btn btn-link\"><svg class=\"bi bi-hand-thumbs-down\" width=\"16\" height=\"16\"><use xlink:href=\"#icon-hand-thumbs-down\"\/><\/svg><\/button><span id=\"link_bad_count_1388\" class = \"link_bad_count\" style=\"color:red; font-size:85%;\">0<\/span><\/td><\/tr><tr><td colspan=\"2\"><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https:\/\/www.gmc-uk.org\/ethical-guidance\/ethical-guidance-for-doctors\/good-medical-practice\/domain-1---knowledge-skills-and-performance\">GMC: Good medical practice - Knowledge skills and performance links<\/a><\/td><\/tr><\/table>","media":"","concepts_for_notes":[],"category_name":"All","subcategory_name":"","comment_count":0},"",[]]
