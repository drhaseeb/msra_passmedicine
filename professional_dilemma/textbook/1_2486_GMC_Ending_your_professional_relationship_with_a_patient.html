They state that;<br \/><br \/>You must only end a professional relationship with a patient when the breakdown of trust means you cannot provide good clinical care. This includes the patient being violent, threatening you or being abusive or the patient having stolen from you or the premises. It also includes the patient persistently acted inconsiderately or unreasonably or if they have made a sexual advance to you. <br \/><br \/>You should not end a relationship due to a complaint or due to resource implications.<br \/><br \/>Before you end the relationship you must warn the patient you are considering ending it and do what you can to restore the relationship. If this fails you must explore alternatives to ending it and discuss the situation with an experienced colleague or your employer.<br \/><br \/>When you end a relationship you must be satisfied that your reason is fair and does not discriminate. Then make sure the patient is told this is happening, and why. If practical do this in writing.","notes_hash":"cf666bbb208396b1d2f4e51a2eb1c650","knowledge_graph_node_id_link":0,"links":"<table style='width:100%'><tr><td>GMC<\/td><td style = \"float: right;width:115px;\"><button type=\"button\" style=\"\" id=\"link_like_1356\" data-linkid=\"1356\" data-rating=\"1\" class=\"rate-link btn btn-link\"><svg class=\"bi bi-hand-thumbs-up\" width=\"16\" height=\"16\"><use xlink:href=\"#icon-hand-thumbs-up\"\/><\/svg><\/button><span id=\"link_good_count_1356\" class = \"link_good_count\" style=\"color:green; font-size:85%;\">0<\/span><button type=\"button\" style=\"\" id=\"link_dislike_1356\" data-linkid=\"1356\" data-rating=\"0\" class=\"rate-link btn btn-link\"><svg class=\"bi bi-hand-thumbs-down\" width=\"16\" height=\"16\"><use xlink:href=\"#icon-hand-thumbs-down\"\/><\/svg><\/button><span id=\"link_bad_count_1356\" class = \"link_bad_count\" style=\"color:red; font-size:85%;\">0<\/span><\/td><\/tr><tr><td colspan=\"2\"><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https:\/\/www.gmc-uk.org\/ethical-guidance\/ethical-guidance-for-doctors\/ending-your-professional-relationship-with-a-patient\">Ending professional relationship with patient links<\/a><\/td><\/tr><\/table>","media":"","concepts_for_notes":[],"category_name":"All","subcategory_name":"","comment_count":0},"",[]]
