This is to ensure that trust between doctors and patients is maintained.<br \/><br \/>Current patients<br \/><ul><li>You must not engage in a sexual or emotionally inappropriate relationship with a patient.<\/li><li>You must not terminate a professional relationship with a patient in order to pursue a personal relationship.<\/li><\/ul><br \/>Former patients<br \/><ul><li>Here the GMC has slightly less hard and fast rules. For former patients, the timing of the professional relationship and the vulnerability of the patient are very important.<\/li><\/ul><br \/>Timing<br \/><ul><li>If you have treated a patient for a long time then this is more likely to be inappropriate. <\/li><li>If your professional relationship with the patient has only just ended then this is more likely to be inappropriate. <\/li><\/ul><br \/>Vulnerability <br \/><ul><li>If the patient was vulnerable when you were their doctor, such as young adults and those with mental illness, then it is not appropriate to pursue a relationship with them regardless of the elapsed time. <\/li><li>If the person is still vulnerable then it is of course not appropriate to pursue a personal relationship with them. <\/li><\/ul><br \/><h5 class='notes-heading'>Examples<\/h5><br \/>You are a GP trainee and you see a patient for one consultation about a minor sporting injury. You then meet this person in the local pub and hit it off. This is likely appropriate as you have not used a position of power or responsibility to further the relationship. <br \/><br \/>You are a GP trainee and have been seeing a patient regularly during your attachment. They have confided in you that their partner is abusive. You have helped them to find support groups and they leave their partner. It would be inappropriate to then start a relationship with this person when your placement ends. <br \/><br \/>The GMC states that serious or repeated failure to abide by these guidelines will risk your registration. If in doubt consult a colleague or your defence union.","notes_hash":"3ea582008d9e8494fd33a60551782d0f","knowledge_graph_node_id_link":0,"links":"<table style='width:100%'><tr><td>GMC<\/td><td style = \"float: right;width:115px;\"><button type=\"button\" style=\"\" id=\"link_like_1361\" data-linkid=\"1361\" data-rating=\"1\" class=\"rate-link btn btn-link\"><svg class=\"bi bi-hand-thumbs-up\" width=\"16\" height=\"16\"><use xlink:href=\"#icon-hand-thumbs-up\"\/><\/svg><\/button><span id=\"link_good_count_1361\" class = \"link_good_count\" style=\"color:green; font-size:85%;\">0<\/span><button type=\"button\" style=\"\" id=\"link_dislike_1361\" data-linkid=\"1361\" data-rating=\"0\" class=\"rate-link btn btn-link\"><svg class=\"bi bi-hand-thumbs-down\" width=\"16\" height=\"16\"><use xlink:href=\"#icon-hand-thumbs-down\"\/><\/svg><\/button><span id=\"link_bad_count_1361\" class = \"link_bad_count\" style=\"color:red; font-size:85%;\">0<\/span><\/td><\/tr><tr><td colspan=\"2\"><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https:\/\/www.gmc-uk.org\/ethical-guidance\/ethical-guidance-for-doctors\/maintaining-a-professional-boundary-between-you-and-your-patient\">Maintaining a professional boundary between you and your patient<\/a><\/td><\/tr><\/table>","media":"","concepts_for_notes":[],"category_name":"All","subcategory_name":"","comment_count":0},"",[]]
