Failure to abide by this may jeopardise patient care and the public trust in doctors. This may also lead to deregistration.<br \/><br \/>If you find that your colleague has engaged in a verbal or non-verbal sexual behaviour with a patient, you have a duty to report this because patient safety or care may be compromised. This should be done according to the GMC guidance on raising concerns as such:<br \/><ul><li>Follow the trust policy if available <\/li><li>Ask advice from a senior e.g. direct supervisor, consultant, clinical director, GP partner<\/li><li>If you work in a general practice, seek advice from the GP partner. However, if the incident involves the partner, raise your concern outside the practice e.g. clinical governance lead.<\/li><li>Contact the General Medical Council to investigate if you feel that the response to the incident has been inadequate<\/li><\/ul><br \/>When reporting this matter, only disclose pertinent details. Patient identity should be concealed unless patient safety becomes an issue (i.e. patient safety trumps patient confidentiality<\/td><td>. Prior to breaking confidentiality, patient's consent should be obtained. If the patient declines to consent, the disclosure is only appropriate if it is in the public interest. <br \/><br \/>In the case of a sexual assault or a criminal activity such as rape or engaging in sexual intercourse with an underage patient, the police should be involved. In cases involving children, safeguarding team should be involved.","notes_hash":"687cc8e2cae3f2ebf3e65de13e76ae7a","knowledge_graph_node_id_link":0,"links":"<table style='width:100%'><tr><td>GMC<\/td><td style = \"float: right;width:115px;\"><button type=\"button\" style=\"\" id=\"link_like_1368\" data-linkid=\"1368\" data-rating=\"1\" class=\"rate-link btn btn-link\"><svg class=\"bi bi-hand-thumbs-up\" width=\"16\" height=\"16\"><use xlink:href=\"#icon-hand-thumbs-up\"\/><\/svg><\/button><span id=\"link_good_count_1368\" class = \"link_good_count\" style=\"color:green; font-size:85%;\">0<\/span><button type=\"button\" style=\"\" id=\"link_dislike_1368\" data-linkid=\"1368\" data-rating=\"0\" class=\"rate-link btn btn-link\"><svg class=\"bi bi-hand-thumbs-down\" width=\"16\" height=\"16\"><use xlink:href=\"#icon-hand-thumbs-down\"\/><\/svg><\/button><span id=\"link_bad_count_1368\" class = \"link_bad_count\" style=\"color:red; font-size:85%;\">0<\/span><\/td><\/tr><tr><td colspan=\"2\"><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https:\/\/www.gmc-uk.org\/ethical-guidance\/ethical-guidance-for-doctors\/sexual-behaviour-and-your-duty-to-report-colleagues\">Sexual behaviour and your duty to report colleagues<\/a><\/td><\/tr><\/table>","media":"","concepts_for_notes":[],"category_name":"All","subcategory_name":"","comment_count":0},"",[]]
