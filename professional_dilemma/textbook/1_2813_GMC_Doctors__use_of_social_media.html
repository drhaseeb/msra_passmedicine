[{"notes_id":"1_2813","category":"1","subcategory":"0","title":"GMC: Doctors' use of social media","body":"The guidance published by the GMC on social media usage is broad in its scope: the emphasis is on upholding the <b>same professional standards <\/b>as we do with our face-to-face interactions and those on traditional media.  These notes are not intended to act as a substitute the full guidance, but rather to provide an accessible summary of salient points for revision purposes.<br \/><br \/>The GMC definition of 'social media' makes reference to blogs (including Twitter), internet forums, content communities (such as Youtube and Instagram) and social networking sites (such as Facebook and LinkedIn).  In case studies published on the GMC website, the scope is also widened to include group messaging services (such as WhatsApp).<br \/><br \/>When using social media, it is important to remember the following:<br \/><ul><li>Social media sites cannot guarantee privacy <b>regardless of what privacy settings are in place <\/b><\/li><li>As such, it should be assumed that patients, employers (current and prospective), professional regulators <b>can see your personal information<\/b><\/li><li>Once information has been published online it can be difficult or impossible to <b>erase completely<\/b><\/li><li>Information about your <b>location<\/b> may also be embedded within photographs and may be shared without your knowledge<\/li><li>Content posted <b>anonymously can be traced<\/b> back to its point of origin in many cases<\/li><\/ul><br \/>Practical recommendations included within the guidance:<br \/><ul><li>Maintain privacy: regularly review privacy settings, ensure all content published is only accessible to the intended audience.<\/li><li>Maintain boundaries: do not communicate with patients via personal profiles such as Facebook. Instead redirect them to the relevant professional channels if appropriate.<\/li><li>Maintain confidentiality: never share identifiable patient information online, even in forums accessible by 'professionals' only.  Remember: the sum of information available online may enable identification, even if the individual was not identifiable from your post or entry in isolation.<\/li><li>Maintain respect for colleagues: treat colleagues fairly and with respect (<i> Good Medical Practice<\/i>). Never bully, harass or make unfounded claims.  Defamation and copyright law still applies when referring to an individual organisation online even when using a personal profile.<\/li><li>Maintain trust in the profession: if you identify yourself as a doctor, you must also identify by your name, and ensure any content published in this capacity is factual and can be cross-checked.  Be open about conflicts of interest.<\/li><\/ul>","notes_hash":"edea8faa4faa1997346d56e66edce504","knowledge_graph_node_id_link":0,"links":"<table style='width:100%'><tr><td>GMC<\/td><td style = \"float: right;width:115px;\"><button type=\"button\" style=\"\" id=\"link_like_1360\" data-linkid=\"1360\" data-rating=\"1\" class=\"rate-link btn btn-link\"><svg class=\"bi bi-hand-thumbs-up\" width=\"16\" height=\"16\"><use xlink:href=\"#icon-hand-thumbs-up\"\/><\/svg><\/button><span id=\"link_good_count_1360\" class = \"link_good_count\" style=\"color:green; font-size:85%;\">0<\/span><button type=\"button\" style=\"\" id=\"link_dislike_1360\" data-linkid=\"1360\" data-rating=\"0\" class=\"rate-link btn btn-link\"><svg class=\"bi bi-hand-thumbs-down\" width=\"16\" height=\"16\"><use xlink:href=\"#icon-hand-thumbs-down\"\/><\/svg><\/button><span id=\"link_bad_count_1360\" class = \"link_bad_count\" style=\"color:red; font-size:85%;\">0<\/span><\/td><\/tr><tr><td colspan=\"2\"><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https:\/\/www.gmc-uk.org\/ethical-guidance\/ethical-guidance-for-doctors\/doctors-use-of-social-media\/doctors-use-of-social-media\">Doctors' use of social media<\/a><\/td><\/tr><\/table>","media":"","concepts_for_notes":[],"category_name":"All","subcategory_name":"","comment_count":0},"",[]]
