In basic terms, a person is deemed to have capacity to make decisions if they have sufficient understanding and memory to comprehend the situation they find themselves in and can make an informed choice about treatment options.<br \/><br \/>In England and Wales, the Mental Capacity Act 2005 is the governing legislature on issues concerning capacity. In Scotland, the Adults With Incapacity Act 2000 is used and in Northern Ireland, capacity is a common law issue. The Mental Capacity Act is different from the Mental Health Act, the latter can be seen as for mental health conditions, whereas the former is for physical health conditions. The Mental Capacity Act provides information for the procedures to be followed when a patient lacks capacity, and also provides legal authority for persons to make decisions on their behalf.<br \/><br \/><h5 class='notes-heading'>Assessing Capacity<\/h5><br \/>In order to have capacity, the person being examined must be able to demonstrate the following four abilities:<br \/><ul><li>They must be able to <b>understand<\/b> the information surrounding a decision and its consequences<\/li><li>They must be able to <b>retain<\/b> the information long enough to make a decision<\/li><li>They must be able to <b>use<\/b> the information, by weighing up the pros and the cons of the decision<\/li><li>They must be able to <b>communicate<\/b> the decision<\/li><\/ul><br \/>If a person lacks any one of these four abilities, then they are deemed to not have capacity, and <span class=\"concept\" data-cid=\"10983\">a decision can be made for them by their medical team<\/span>. The GMC has further guidelines on capacity that you should read and understand.<br \/><br \/>The guidance by the GMC on assessing capacity is summarised below:<br \/><ul><li>Ensure you keep up to date with policies and laws in your area, and if you are unsure, seek help from your defence body<\/li><li>Always presume capacity: A person should never be assumed to not have capacity<\/li><li>Never assume a person doesn't have capacity because of their age, disability, appearance, behaviour, medical condition, their beliefs, their apparent inability to communicate, or the fact that they make a decision that you disagree with.<\/li><li>Capacity can fluctuate with disease severity: Care should be taken to maximise a patients ability to make a decision and a patient that appears to lack capacity at one time may regain capacity at another point<\/li><li>Plan ahead for foreseeable changes in a patient's ability to make decisions: Discuss treatment options when a patient is able to listen and use the information, ask if any family members or friends might help them retain the information, and find the best way to communicate to the patient<\/li><li>If a patient is likely to have difficulty retaining information, give them a written record<\/li><li>Advanced refusals of treatment must be recorded, signed and witnessed<\/li><li>If your assessment reveals a borderline capacity, you should look to seek help from other healthcare professionals that know the patient<\/li><\/ul><br \/>Making decisions when a patient lacks capacity:<br \/><ul><li>Make the care of the patient your first concern<\/li><li>Treat patients as individuals and with dignity<\/li><li>Support patients in their decisions<\/li><li>Do not discriminate against patients<\/li><\/ul><br \/>It is also important to consider:<br \/><ul><li>Whether the lack of capacity is temporary or permanent<\/li><li>Which option provides the best clinical benefit<\/li><li>The views of anyone with legal authority to make decisions on behalf of the patient<\/li><li>Any advance statements or opinions on treatments already offered by the patient<\/li><\/ul><br \/>In an emergency situation, patients can be treated without consent, if there is an immediate and probable threat to their life or of a serious deterioration in their illness. When they recover, you must tell them what has been done as soon as they can understand. <br \/><br \/><b>Lasting Powers of Attorney<\/b> (LPA) are appointed by patients under the Mental Capacity Act before they lose their capacity, and can make decisions on their behalf. The LPA cannot make treatment decisions if the patient still has capacity.","notes_hash":"443c619152354de610601cd16787ad38","knowledge_graph_node_id_link":0,"links":"<table style='width:100%'><tr><td>GMC<\/td><td style = \"float: right;width:115px;\"><button type=\"button\" style=\"\" id=\"link_like_1451\" data-linkid=\"1451\" data-rating=\"1\" class=\"rate-link btn btn-link\"><svg class=\"bi bi-hand-thumbs-up\" width=\"16\" height=\"16\"><use xlink:href=\"#icon-hand-thumbs-up\"\/><\/svg><\/button><span id=\"link_good_count_1451\" class = \"link_good_count\" style=\"color:green; font-size:85%;\">0<\/span><button type=\"button\" style=\"\" id=\"link_dislike_1451\" data-linkid=\"1451\" data-rating=\"0\" class=\"rate-link btn btn-link\"><svg class=\"bi bi-hand-thumbs-down\" width=\"16\" height=\"16\"><use xlink:href=\"#icon-hand-thumbs-down\"\/><\/svg><\/button><span id=\"link_bad_count_1451\" class = \"link_bad_count\" style=\"color:red; font-size:85%;\">1<\/span><\/td><\/tr><tr><td colspan=\"2\"><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https:\/\/www.gmc-uk.org\/professional-standards\/ethical-hub\/mental-capacity\">GMC: Mental capacity<\/a><\/td><\/tr><\/table>","media":"","concepts_for_notes":[],"category_name":"All","subcategory_name":"","comment_count":0},"",[]]
