However, sometimes patients are unable to protect themselves, and we may need to disclose personal information to protect their health and welfare. <br \/><br \/><h5 class='notes-heading'>I'm worried that my patient is at risk of harm abuse or neglect- Should I disclose?<\/h5><br \/>1) Empower patients- make decisions about how to best move forward in partnership <br \/><br \/>2) If disclosure is required by law- You must disclose, but only the specific requested information, in the manner required by law. Inform your patient of disclosure (unless It would undermine the purpose)<br \/><br \/>3) Some disclosures are permitted but not required by law- these should have a legal basis <br \/><br \/>4) How you act will partly depend on whether this patient has capacity or lacks capacity:<br \/><br \/><div class=\"table-responsive\"><table class = \"tlarge table table-striped table-bordered\"  data-role=\"table\" id=\"tableid1\" ><thead><tr><th><\/th><th>Disclosure required by law<\/th><th>Disclosure not required by law<\/th><\/tr><\/thead><tbody><tr><td><b>Has capacity<\/b><\/td><td>You must disclose<\/td><td>Requires patient consent (if practicable)- ultimately the patient's decision unless non-disclosure puts others at risk of serious harm\/death. If they refuse, find out why, inform them of the risks and refer to support groups<\/td><\/tr><tr><td><b>Lacks capacity<\/b><\/td><td>You must disclose<\/td><td>You must disclose to appropriate authority\/person (unless not of overall benefit to the patient). Discuss with an experienced colleague and document if you think it's not in the patient's best interest<\/td><\/tr><\/tbody><\/table><\/div><br \/><h5 class='notes-heading'>Can I share information to protect others\/the public?<\/h5><br \/>Confidentiality is in the public interest as it benefits society and individuals to seek medical care. However, this must be balanced with protecting and promoting the health of patients and the public. <br \/><br \/><div class=\"table-responsive\"><table class = \"tlarge table table-striped table-bordered\"  data-role=\"table\" id=\"tableid2\" ><thead><tr><th>Required by law<\/th><th>Requests for information<\/th><th>Disclosure not required by law<\/th><\/tr><\/thead><tbody><tr><td>You must disclose e.g. infectious disease notification, provision of social and health care, preventing terrorism and investigation of road traffic accidents.<\/td><td>Take these seriously if patients pose a risk of serious harm (e.g. violent or sex offenders), and for formal inquiries, inquests and reviews<\/td><td>Either patient must consent (unless not practicable) or must have a legal basis<\/td><\/tr><\/tbody><\/table><\/div>If you have already decided to disclose the information, don't request consent, instead inform them of this intention, unless not safe or practicable.<br \/><br \/><br \/><h5 class='notes-heading'>Deciding if you will disclose regardless of if the patient consents:<\/h5><br \/>1. Would non-disclosure put others at risk of death or serious harm? - this may justify disclosure e.g. <br \/><ul><li>When a victim of violence doesn't want to inform the police, but the perpetrator still poses a significant risk to others, such as children in domestic violence.<\/li><li>If someone keeps driving despite being told they are not fit to drive<\/li><li>A patient has a serious communicable disease but refuses to disclose<\/li><li>A patient is working despite being unfit for work and this poses a serious risk to others<\/li><\/ul><br \/>2. You should only disclose if you decide that the risk of not disclosing is so serious that it outweighs the patient and public interest in maintaining confidentiality. <br \/><br \/><div class=\"table-responsive\"><table class = \"tlarge table table-striped table-bordered\"  data-role=\"table\" id=\"tableid3\" ><thead><tr><th>Pro-confidentiality factors<\/th><th>Pro-disclosure factors<\/th><\/tr><\/thead><tbody><tr><td>Harm\/distress from disclosing may cause withdrawal from care and poor health<\/td><td>Harm to others if not disclosed<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Disclosing will reduce overall trust in perception of doctors<\/td><td>Benefit to others if information disclosed<\/td><\/tr><\/tbody><\/table><\/div><br \/>Think about the nature of the information and what the patient thinks. Can you minimise the breach of the patient's privacy and still avoid harm?<br \/><br \/>Genetic medicine introduces another hurdle in relation to confidentiality, because if your patient Is found to have a genetic condition, this might also suggest a probability of this condition in a relative. Many patients share these results with relatives especially if they know it can help to prevent health problems in their relatives. However, if a patient refuses, it would be just to disclose if non-disclosure would risk death or serious harm in others. Try to not disclose patient identity when advising the others of the risks identified to them.<br \/><br \/>Always document in patient records when disclosing information. Document steps you've taken to seek consent from or inform the patient about the disclosure, or reasons for not doing so. <br \/><br \/>Whether you can disclose without consent can be complex. Before doing so, seek advice from a Caldicott or data guardian who isn't connected to the reason for the disclosure. Keep the patient details anonymous if possible.","notes_hash":"8f27fb204768d411d2a582c3c2d3c770","knowledge_graph_node_id_link":0,"links":"<table style='width:100%'><tr><td>GMC<\/td><td style = \"float: right;width:115px;\"><button type=\"button\" style=\"\" id=\"link_like_1426\" data-linkid=\"1426\" data-rating=\"1\" class=\"rate-link btn btn-link\"><svg class=\"bi bi-hand-thumbs-up\" width=\"16\" height=\"16\"><use xlink:href=\"#icon-hand-thumbs-up\"\/><\/svg><\/button><span id=\"link_good_count_1426\" class = \"link_good_count\" style=\"color:green; font-size:85%;\">0<\/span><button type=\"button\" style=\"\" id=\"link_dislike_1426\" data-linkid=\"1426\" data-rating=\"0\" class=\"rate-link btn btn-link\"><svg class=\"bi bi-hand-thumbs-down\" width=\"16\" height=\"16\"><use xlink:href=\"#icon-hand-thumbs-down\"\/><\/svg><\/button><span id=\"link_bad_count_1426\" class = \"link_bad_count\" style=\"color:red; font-size:85%;\">0<\/span><\/td><\/tr><tr><td colspan=\"2\"><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https:\/\/www.gmc-uk.org\/ethical-guidance\/ethical-guidance-for-doctors\/confidentiality\/disclosures-for-the-protection-of-patients-and-others\">GMC: Confidentiality - Disclosures for the protection of patients and others<\/a><\/td><\/tr><\/table>","media":"","concepts_for_notes":[],"category_name":"All","subcategory_name":"","comment_count":0},"",[]]
