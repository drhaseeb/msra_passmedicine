[{"notes_id":"1_2808","category":"1","subcategory":"0","title":"GMC: Treatment and care towards the end of life - Working with the principles and decision-making models","body":"There's an old aphorism in medicine sometimes attributed to Hippocrates: 'c'ure sometimes, treat often, comfort always'. This reminds us to think about goals of care. The end of life is a time when it is important to think ethically and communicate effectively about these goals.<br \/><br \/>Recognition that a patient is entering the end of life is the first step is determining the goals of care. We are often too slow to see the signs that death is near, and too slow to think that our interventions need to change in order to reflect this. Just because a patient cannot be cured does not mean they should not be treated or comforted.<br \/><br \/>Good palliative care at the end of life can make the difference between an agonising and emotionally traumatic death or one in comfort, quiet and relative dignity. Good clinical medicine and good ethical reasoning are needed to make sure this happens. <br \/><br \/><h5 class='notes-heading'>Key principles<\/h5><br \/>The GMC lists key principles which should control decision-making at the end of life. <br \/><br \/><i>Equalities and human rights.<\/i> Those at the end of life are owed the same quality of care as all patients, including with regard to dignity and confidentiality.<br \/><br \/><i>Presumption in favour of prolonging life.<\/i> Any decision about potentially life-prolonging treatment should not be motivated by a desire to bring about a patient's death. There is also a general presumption to take all reasonable steps which can prolong life, though, depending on patient's wishes and doctors' clinical judgement, it may be considered appropriate to refrain from providing or withdraw a potentially life-prolonging intervention.<br \/><br \/><i>Presumption of capacity.<\/i> The usual assumption that all adults have capacity until it has been shown they lack it applies to patients at the end of life.<br \/><br \/><i>Maximising capacity to make decisions.<\/i> Capacity should be assessed for each relevant decision, and steps should be taken to support patients in doing so.<br \/><br \/><i>Overall benefit.<\/i> If a patient lacks capacity, a decision in their overall benefit should be made.<br \/><br \/>A decision-making model for patients with capacity<br \/><ul><li>Assess the patient's condition, understanding and views<\/li><li>Use your experience and clinical judgment to identify investigations and treatments clinically appropriate and likely to result in overall benefit for the patient. Explain these options, laying out their potential burdens, risks and benefits<\/li><li>Allow the patient to accept or refuse any of these options<\/li><\/ul><br \/><h5 class='notes-heading'>What if a patient with capacity requests something clinically inappropriate?<\/h5><br \/>Inquire into why the patient is making such a request, and clarify potential misunderstandings. If the patient maintains their clinically inappropriate request you are not obliged to fulfil it. You should explain why you do not think it is appropriate and allow the patient to exercise their right to a second opinion should they wish to do so.<br \/><br \/><h5 class='notes-heading'>A decision-making model for adults who lack capacity<\/h5><br \/>There are some additional measure to take for adults who lack capacity:<br \/><ul><li>Clearly identify which clinical decisions need to be made<\/li><li>Check if the patient has a legally binding advance decision<\/li><li>Find out if the patient has a legal proxy (NB: not all proxies are permitted to make medical decisions)<\/li><li>Take responsibility for deciding which treatment will provide overall benefit to the patient if there is no legal proxy, making sure to consult those close to the patient when doing so<\/li><\/ul><br \/>When this stage is reached, the model for making a clinical decision is as follows:<br \/><ul><li>Along with the patient's carer, assess the patient's condition, understanding and views<\/li><li>Along with evidence of the patient's views, use your experience and clinical judgement to identify investigations and treatments clinically appropriate and likely to result in overall benefit for the patient<\/li><li>If there is evidence of an advance decision, judge whether it is legally binding and\/or applicable to the current circumstances<\/li><li>If it is, follow it. If it is not, include it as evidence in your assessment of a patient's wishes<\/li><li>If the patient has a legal proxy for clinical decisions, explain to them the different options along with their potential risks, benefits and burdens. Support the proxy's decision-making but do not pressurise it<\/li><li>If a proxy does not have legal power over clinical decisions their views should be considered, along with those of the rest of the healthcare team<\/li><li>In England and Wales, if there is no proxy or forthcoming other person to assist in the process, arrange for an Independent Mental Capacity Advocate to do so<\/li><\/ul><br \/><h5 class='notes-heading'>What if there is disagreement between the proxy the medical team?<\/h5><br \/>If the patient has a proxy to make clinical decisions and there is disagreement between the proxy and the medical team about what clinical decisions should be made steps should be taken to resolve the matter informally, for example by holding a case meeting, getting a second opinion, engaging in further discussion. <br \/><br \/>If all this fails, seek legal advice.<br \/><br \/><h5 class='notes-heading'>How do I make a decision in overall benefit? <\/h5><br \/>Making a decision which is in the patient's overall benefit requires you to think both about clinically and ethically. It's not just a question of asking 'will this intervention work'? You also must ask: 'is it the right thing for this patient under these circumstances?' <br \/><br \/>What might be routine in other circumstances might be inappropriate if a patient is in extremis, for example because the intervention has an unreasonably small prospect of changing management and benefiting the patient. Fluid resuscitation might be basic protocol in other cases, but if a patient is lying on their death bed, it is unclear that they will derive a benefit from intravenous cannulation and a fluid bolus (subcutaneous fluids, however, might be appropriate). <br \/><br \/>Some questions to ask:<br \/><ul><li>What is the aim of this procedure under these circumstances?<\/li><li>Does this procedure benefit the patient?<\/li><li>Is this aim appropriate to the goals of care?<\/li><li>Are these goals better served by other interventions?<\/li><\/ul><br \/>NB: these questions are all about whether the intervention is worthwhile, not whether prolonging life of a given patient is worthwhile. The decision to refrain from intervening or withdrawing an intervention is best made on the basis of the proportionality of the intervention itself and not based on a judgement upon the value of the life it aims to sustain.<br \/><br \/><h5 class='notes-heading'>Putting this in to practice: DNACPR<\/h5><br \/>Decisions to not attempt cardiopulmonary resuscitation illustrate the principles laid out in this guidance. When broaching this subject with patients\/proxies it is important to communicate clearly the potential risks, benefits and harms.  You need to assess the patient's clinical condition carefully as well as their own views. Then you need to lay before them the different options explaining the relevant risks etc. If you are satisfied that the patient understands this but still wishes to be resuscitated, it is important to explore this further. However, ultimately, the patient's wish cannot compel you to engage in CPR if, in your considered professional judgement, it is not appropriate. <br \/><br \/>Note, however, that a DNACPR order is not a licence for neglect or an excuse to stop all treatment. A patient may 'be DNACPR' but intravenous antibiotics might still be appropriate for them, for example. <span class=\"concept\" data-cid=\"11076\">A DNACPR is only one clinical decision: the decisions that CPR would be inappropriate. It says nothing about other ceilings of care<\/span>.<br \/><br \/><h5 class='notes-heading'>General pointers<\/h5><br \/>Good communication'at a time of life which is fraught with emotion and stress poor communication and misunderstanding can only hinder care.<br \/><br \/>Plan ahead'failing to think about the end of life can leave patients and medical teams unprepared. Don't be blindsided by a deteriorating patient. Keep an eye out for the signs of decline and initiate the important discussions with the patient, relatives and colleagues.<br \/><br \/>Uncertainty'there is a lot of uncertainty around death. Help relatives deal with this by explaining what their relative is experiencing and what your plan is.<br \/><br \/>Review decisions'sometimes, a patient's condition will change unexpectedly. Be ready to reconsider previous decisions in light of this.<br \/><br \/>Know the law'be familiar with the laws relevant to your jurisdiction concerning capacity, advanced decisions etc. <br \/><br \/>Think ethically'just like it is important to reason from basic principles to conclusions in clinical medicine, so it is important to reason ethically through difficult decisions.","notes_hash":"1cdb79c52d4cdb73d68ec8f2b0bc6bd8","knowledge_graph_node_id_link":0,"links":"<table style='width:100%'><tr><td>GMC<\/td><td style = \"float: right;width:115px;\"><button type=\"button\" style=\"\" id=\"link_like_1385\" data-linkid=\"1385\" data-rating=\"1\" class=\"rate-link btn btn-link\"><svg class=\"bi bi-hand-thumbs-up\" width=\"16\" height=\"16\"><use xlink:href=\"#icon-hand-thumbs-up\"\/><\/svg><\/button><span id=\"link_good_count_1385\" class = \"link_good_count\" style=\"color:green; font-size:85%;\">0<\/span><button type=\"button\" style=\"\" id=\"link_dislike_1385\" data-linkid=\"1385\" data-rating=\"0\" class=\"rate-link btn btn-link\"><svg class=\"bi bi-hand-thumbs-down\" width=\"16\" height=\"16\"><use xlink:href=\"#icon-hand-thumbs-down\"\/><\/svg><\/button><span id=\"link_bad_count_1385\" class = \"link_bad_count\" style=\"color:red; font-size:85%;\">0<\/span><\/td><\/tr><tr><td colspan=\"2\"><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https:\/\/www.gmc-uk.org\/ethical-guidance\/ethical-guidance-for-doctors\/treatment-and-care-towards-the-end-of-life\/working-with-the-principles-and-decision-making-models\">GMC: Treatment and care towards the end of life - Working with the principles and decision-making models links<\/a><\/td><\/tr><\/table>","media":"","concepts_for_notes":[],"category_name":"All","subcategory_name":"","comment_count":0},"",[]]
