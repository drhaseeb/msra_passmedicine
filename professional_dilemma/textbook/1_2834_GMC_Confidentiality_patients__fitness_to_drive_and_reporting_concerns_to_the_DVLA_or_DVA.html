This can be put at risk by breaking confidentiality. Fitness to drive is one area where it is important to know what is expected of you, in both a legal and moral sense. The Driver and Vehicle Licensing Agency (DVLA)\/ Vehicle Agency (DVA) are legally responsible for deciding if a person is medically unfit to drive. This means they need to know if a person holding a driving licence has a condition or is undergoing treatment that may affect their safety as a driver.<br \/><br \/>First off, it is the driver's legal responsibility to tell the DVLA or DVA about any condition or treatment. Doctors should alert patients to conditions and treatments that might affect their ability to drive and remind them of their duty to tell the appropriate agency. However, doctors may need to make a decision about whether to disclose relevant information without consent if a patient is unfit to drive but continues to do so.<br \/><br \/>You should always ask for a patient's consent before disclosing information for the protection of others (if it is safe, appropriate or practicable to do so). If it is not possible to seek consent or the patient has refused, disclosing personal information may be justified. This is particularly when there is a risk of death or serious harm to others. The benefits of disclosure must outweigh the interest in keeping the information confidential.<br \/><br \/>Problems with breaking confidentiality: <br \/><ul><li>Patients may avoid seeking medical help, or may under-report symptoms.<\/li><li>Consultations may become more strained or mistrusting.<\/li><li>Complaints may be made against the doctor or practice.<\/li><\/ul><br \/>You should not ask for consent if you have already decided to disclose information in the public interest but, if possible, you should tell the patient about your intention to disclose personal information. If the patient objects to the disclosure you should consider any reasons they give for objecting.<br \/><br \/>Reasons that the patient may object to sharing of information: <br \/><ul><li>They are concerned about the implications for work, family or other areas.<\/li><li>In principle, they do not feel that it is your place to share the information.<\/li><li>They do not understand the reason for the information sharing.<\/li><\/ul><br \/><b> When deciding whether the public interest outweighs potential harm, consider: <\/b><br \/><ul><li>The potential harm or distress to the patient arising from the disclosure.<\/li><li>The potential harm to trust in doctors generally.<\/li><li>The potential harm to others if the information is not disclosed.<\/li><li>The potential benefits to an individual or society due to the release of the information.<\/li><li>The nature of the information to be disclosed, and any views expressed by the patient.<\/li><li>Whether the harms can be avoided or benefits gained without breaching the patient's privacy.<\/li><\/ul><br \/>When diagnosing a patient's condition, or providing or arranging treatment, you should consider whether the condition or treatment may affect their ability to drive safely. To help determine this, you can refer to the DVLA's guidance on assessing fitness to drive. You may also seek the advice of an experienced colleague or the DVLA medical adviser.<br \/><br \/>If a patient has a condition or is undergoing treatment that could impair their fitness to drive, you should: <br \/><ul><li>Explain this to the patient and tell them that they have a legal duty to inform the DVLA.<\/li><li>Tell the patient that you may be obliged to disclose relevant medical information about them, if they continue to drive when they are not fit to do so.<\/li><li>Make a note of any advice you have given to a patient in their medical record.<\/li><li>If a patient is incapable of understanding this advice, such as in cognitive impairment, you should inform the DVLA as soon as practicable.<\/li><\/ul><br \/>The patient is welcome to seek a second medical opinion, and you should help facilitate this. However, you should still advise them not to drive in the meantime. If you become aware that a patient is continuing to drive when they may not be fit to do so, you should make every reasonable effort to persuade them to stop. Only then, would you consider breaching confidentiality. This is not an easy decision to make, but may be necessary for the safety of others.","notes_hash":"d659747a5fd4f36f16a9a2573fa3383f","knowledge_graph_node_id_link":0,"links":"<table style='width:100%'><tr><td>GMC<\/td><td style = \"float: right;width:115px;\"><button type=\"button\" style=\"\" id=\"link_like_1406\" data-linkid=\"1406\" data-rating=\"1\" class=\"rate-link btn btn-link\"><svg class=\"bi bi-hand-thumbs-up\" width=\"16\" height=\"16\"><use xlink:href=\"#icon-hand-thumbs-up\"\/><\/svg><\/button><span id=\"link_good_count_1406\" class = \"link_good_count\" style=\"color:green; font-size:85%;\">0<\/span><button type=\"button\" style=\"\" id=\"link_dislike_1406\" data-linkid=\"1406\" data-rating=\"0\" class=\"rate-link btn btn-link\"><svg class=\"bi bi-hand-thumbs-down\" width=\"16\" height=\"16\"><use xlink:href=\"#icon-hand-thumbs-down\"\/><\/svg><\/button><span id=\"link_bad_count_1406\" class = \"link_bad_count\" style=\"color:red; font-size:85%;\">0<\/span><\/td><\/tr><tr><td colspan=\"2\"><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https:\/\/www.gmc-uk.org\/ethical-guidance\/ethical-guidance-for-doctors\/confidentiality---patients-fitness-to-drive-and-reporting-concerns-to-the-dvla-or-dva\">GMC: Confidentiality: patients' fitness to drive and reporting concerns to the DVLA or DVA links<\/a><\/td><\/tr><\/table>","media":"","concepts_for_notes":[],"category_name":"All","subcategory_name":"","comment_count":0},"",[]]
