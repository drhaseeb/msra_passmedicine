[{"notes_id":"1_2797","category":"1","subcategory":"0","title":"GMC: Duty of candour","body":"In simple translation, 'duty' refers to what we are committed to do and to be 'candour' is to be open and honest. In medical practice, this means being transparent and truthful to parents about what happens to them, be that good or bad. The duty of candour relates to paragraph 6 - 21 in the GMC's Good Medical Practice which states: 'Your duty to be open and honest with patients in your care, or those close to them, if something goes wrong. This includes advice on apologising'.<br \/><br \/>The General Medical Council (GMC) have issued guidance on how to be a doctor who talks to patients with candour when events have not gone according to plan, when mistakes are made and when harm is caused.<br \/><br \/>The four main suggestions are:<br \/><ul><li>Talk to the patient and admit the error or situation<\/li><li>Explain why the situation has happened<\/li><li>Apologise to the patient<ul><li>The GMC clearly state that <span class=\"concept\" data-cid=\"12191\">apologising does not mean admitting legal liability<\/span>  <\/li><\/ul><\/li><li>Offer a constructive action that will either put the situation right or improve things<\/li><\/ul><br \/>It is vital that both the healthcare professional(s) involved in the error reflect on the incident but also that the system is informed and is given a chance to adapt so that the error is not repeated. This is often in the form of a 'critical incident form' within the hospital.<br \/><br \/><h5 class='notes-heading'>Example<\/h5><br \/>A doctor prescribes an insulin dose at the wrong dose and the patient suffers a hypoglycaemic episode. The patient recovers after rescue treatment are initiated and the patient does not suffer any lasting harm. In accordance with the GMC guidance, the doctor responsible talks to the patient:<br \/><ul><li>They explain that there was a dosing error resulting in the hypoglycaemic episode<\/li><li>They explain that it was an error of prescription that was responsible for this dosing problem<\/li><li>They apologise for the error and for the effects of it<\/li><li>They explain that there will be a formal reporting of the error and further training in prescribing insulin to prevent this from happening again<\/li><\/ul><br \/>The doctor informs his consultant and fills in a critical incidence form. The case is discussed in the departmental morbidity and mortality meeting.","notes_hash":"a673f129042af43985421df371ad2d65","knowledge_graph_node_id_link":0,"links":"<table style='width:100%'><tr><td>GMC<\/td><td style = \"float: right;width:115px;\"><button type=\"button\" style=\"\" id=\"link_like_1366\" data-linkid=\"1366\" data-rating=\"1\" class=\"rate-link btn btn-link\"><svg class=\"bi bi-hand-thumbs-up\" width=\"16\" height=\"16\"><use xlink:href=\"#icon-hand-thumbs-up\"\/><\/svg><\/button><span id=\"link_good_count_1366\" class = \"link_good_count\" style=\"color:green; font-size:85%;\">0<\/span><button type=\"button\" style=\"\" id=\"link_dislike_1366\" data-linkid=\"1366\" data-rating=\"0\" class=\"rate-link btn btn-link\"><svg class=\"bi bi-hand-thumbs-down\" width=\"16\" height=\"16\"><use xlink:href=\"#icon-hand-thumbs-down\"\/><\/svg><\/button><span id=\"link_bad_count_1366\" class = \"link_bad_count\" style=\"color:red; font-size:85%;\">0<\/span><\/td><\/tr><tr><td colspan=\"2\"><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https:\/\/www.gmc-uk.org\/ethical-guidance\/ethical-guidance-for-doctors\/candour---openness-and-honesty-when-things-go-wrong\">Openness and honesty when things go wrong: The professional duty of candour<\/a><\/td><\/tr><\/table>","media":"","concepts_for_notes":[],"category_name":"All","subcategory_name":"","comment_count":0},"",[]]
