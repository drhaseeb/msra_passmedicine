This article relates to the specific guidance on protecting children and young people, including how to identify those at risk of, or suffering, from abuse or neglect. <br \/><br \/><b>Roles of all doctors<\/b><br \/><ul><li>You must take into account the safety and welfare of children and young people, regardless of whether you routinely treat them. This means that you must determine the safety of any children or young people that your patients may come into contact with if they could be a risk to them. For example, a GP may be seeing a patient for their alcohol dependency. As well as considering the patient's physical and mental health, you must consider the social care needed at home and the children that may be at home. There may be no need for concern, however there is the potential in this situation for vulnerable children in the home that may need flagging to the relevant authorities, situation dependent. <\/li><li>You must have adequate knowledge of the signs and risk factors (e.g. parents that have mental health issues, drug or alcohol dependence, the presence of domestic violence and living in a socially deprived area) linked to child abuse to ensure you can identify at-risk children and young people. The risk factors mentioned previously are not always present in cases of abuse, and the presence of them does not mean that abuse is taking place. It is important to be aware that signs of abuse can be subtle and can affect children from any background.<\/li><li>You should attempt to identify signs of abuse as early as possible, this includes preempting neglectful situations by identifying parents or guardians that may need extra help, in whatever form this may be. If it is appropriate for you to provide support, then you must take the necessary actions to put this in place. If it is not your role, then refer the family to the local authority children's services so that they can access help. <\/li><li>As well as identifying the at-risk child or young person, you need to be aware of the correct protocols for safeguarding children. This often includes contacting the appropriate safeguarding paediatrician, social services and other healthcare\/ social professionals involved in the child's care. It is important to notify the parents\/ guardians of your referral if appropriate and answer any questions they may have. You should document clearly your concerns and the actions you have taken. You should be confident in being able to appropriately implement these when necessary. You should be aware of your lead clinician's contact details to gain invaluable advice in navigating these often complex situations<\/li><li>If you are concerned about a child or young person, or if a concern is raised to you, it is your obligation and duty as a doctor to act on these worries<\/li><\/ul><br \/><b>Roles of doctors who work with children or young people<\/b><br \/><ul><li>If a part of your job role involves you working with children or young people, you are required to have the appropriate skills to identify patients that have been abused or neglected, and the subsequent ability to take appropriate actions immediately. This does not apply solely to specialties that you might traditionally associate as involving the treatment of children. It encompasses almost all medical careers in one way or another. <\/li><li>Not only must you be actively considering abuse and neglect as a differential diagnosis for certain patients, you must also consider alternative diagnoses that could also provide an explanation for the symptoms. For example, a child presenting with recurrent fractures following several minimal impact injuries immediately rings alarm bells. Here you should consider child abuse as a potential cause. However, it is also important to consider other conditions that might explain this odd presentation, for example it could be osteogenesis imperfecta (a congenital connective tissue disease causing 'brittle bones')<\/li><li>Whilst treating patients that you suspect may have been abused or neglected, you must ensure that these children receive the clinical support and care necessary, and that this does not suffer due to the complicated and time consuming nature of child protection protocols<\/li><li>Where possible, you should support parents or guardians in providing a caring and supportive home for children, an important part of this being the ability to signpost to local services and voluntary groups that may be of use. Even if parents are not currently providing the adequate emotional and physical care for their children, it does not mean that this cannot be improved with help. Sometimes, all that's needed is some encouragement and advice. Referring parents or guardians for additional support does not mean that they are not good parents, and it is important to talk through any queries they may have regarding your referral. Of course, if you suspect abuse then this is a more urgent matter and more drastic intervention is necessary.<\/li><li>Cultural practices in terms of raising children can be vastly different from family to family. Parents and guardians have the freedom to bring up their child as they choose, within reason. The line between abuse or neglect and religious or cultural practices that don't align with your personal view can sometimes be blurred. You should ensure that you are well aware of the beliefs of different cultural and religious groups to ensure that you are clear on what is appropriate and in line with a certain culture, and what is excessive and abusive. In cases where you are unsure of where the boundary lies between cultural or religious practice and neglect, you can consult a member of the relevant group to advise on usual practice and whether the questioned behaviour is fitting and appropriate to the culture\/ religion. The hospital chaplaincy is a good place to start regarding religious matters, however do not delay in referring to the local safeguarding officer if you are in doubt as they will often have a superior knowledge of religious\/ cultural customs. <\/li><li>Similarly, you must ensure that your own cultural or religious background does not affect your decision making in these situations. Personal views should not play a role in making these safeguarding decisions. If in doubt, seek advice from your local safeguarding officer, paediatrician on call or a professional body that has experience in working with children<\/li><li>It is important to notify the parents or guardians of your concerns. If, despite discussing your concerns, you are still unsure of what to do, you should escalate the situation to ensure that no neglected or abused patients slip through the net <\/li><li>If you are a lead clinician regularly involved in the care of children or young people, you should ensure that your juniors are aware of the help and advice that you can offer when it comes to these difficult situations. Your contact details should be handed out so that people can promptly get in contact when needed. Often junior clinicians are unsure of how to deal with a situation involving an abused\/ neglected child. They may not feel confident identifying the red flags and dealing with the parents\/ guardians in a non-accusatory manner. If you are a clinician that regularly deals with this, putting on a short teaching session surrounding these issues may be of benefit<\/li><\/ul><br \/><h5 class='notes-heading'>Summary<\/h5><br \/>All doctors should be aware of the following: <br \/> <br \/><ul><li>the risk factors for abuse or neglect and how to identify an at-risk child<\/li><li>that your adult patients may have a negative impact on the children in their life.
