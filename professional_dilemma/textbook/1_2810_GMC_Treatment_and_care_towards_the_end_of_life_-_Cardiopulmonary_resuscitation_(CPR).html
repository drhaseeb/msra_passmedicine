[{"notes_id":"1_2810","category":"1","subcategory":"0","title":"GMC: Treatment and care towards the end of life - Cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR)","body":"CPR stands for cardiopulmonary resuscitation. The purpose of CPR is to maintain adequate oxygenation of the blood and to restore the circulation in a person's who's heart has stopped pumping. This is known as a cardiac arrest. CPR is taught across the country to a wide range of people, from healthcare novices to experienced professionals. The process involves a series of chest compressions and mouth-to-mouth rescue breaths. If available, a defibrillator is also used to provide stimulation to the heart via electrical shocks. <br \/><br \/>CPR is recognised as an invasive procedure which is a physical burden, especially for a more fragile patient. For example, it would not be unusual to break multiple ribs whilst doing proper chest compressions. CPR is more effective in the right circumstances, and can prolong the oxygenation of brain tissue whilst professionals try to reverse the cause of the cardiac arrest. This reduces the risk of negative sequelae such as long-term cognitive impairment and physical disability. <br \/><br \/>However, CPR generally has a relatively low success rate, especially in patients with multiple comorbidities. Do not attempt CPR (DNACPR) discussions are encouraged in patients that are unlikely to recover if a cardiac arrest was to take place. This is to ensure death does not occur in an undignified manner, which can be unnecessarily traumatic for the patient and their family. <br \/><br \/><br \/><h5 class='notes-heading'>When to consider making a DNACPR decision<\/h5><br \/>Although DNACPR decisions ultimately lie in the hands of the medical team, they should be discussed with the patient and their family (if appropriate). These discussions should explain:<br \/><ul><li>what CPR involves<\/li><li>that it is unlikely to be successful in this patient and why<\/li><li>that if a patient's condition improves, the DNACPR can be re-discussed and revoked<\/li><li>that a DNACPR form does not mean that a patient will not be treated from then on, it simply means that CPR will not be attempted<\/li><li>that the aim of the DNACPR is to give patients and their families more agency over their death and to prevent death in an undignified manner<\/li><li>that having a DNACPR can increase the chances of the patient being able to pass away in their preferred place of death e.g. at home.<\/li><\/ul><br \/>Even if CPR is likely to be successful, it is not always appropriate. As mentioned previously, CPR can cause trauma to the patient as well as long-term negative sequelae, and it is not guaranteed that the patient will recover to their former level of functioning. In these scenarios, it is vital to weigh up the risks and benefits of CPR and discuss these with the patient.  As with any medical treatment or intervention, if a patient has the capacity and is fully informed of the CPR process, they have the right to refuse it with an advanced decision. This is regardless of whether the medical team deem CPR to be an appropriate intervention. <br \/><br \/>Conversely, if a patient lacks capacity, the medical team may decide that CPR is not in the patient's best interests and a DNACPR will be put in place. It is important to identify potential DNACPR patients early to ensure that the relevant documentation is completed and disseminated, as well as allowing time to have these important discussions with the patient and their family. This is especially important if a patient is admitted to hospital when they are acutely unwell and a potential cardiac or respiratory arrest is likely.<br \/><br \/><br \/><h5 class='notes-heading'>Discussions about whether to attempt CPR<\/h5><br \/>As previously mentioned, a decision on the appropriateness of CPR should be made with the patient, their family and with other healthcare professionals. To do this you must: <br \/><ul><li>approach discussions sensitively<\/li><li>remember that some patients, or their relatives, may have preconceived notions of what a DNACPR means and involves. They may need educating on this matter<\/li><li>assess the patient's capacity to make decisions about CPR. If the patient lacks capacity, you must discuss the likely effectiveness of CPR with other healthcare professionals and weigh up the risks and benefits for the patient<\/li><\/ul><br \/><br \/><h5 class='notes-heading'>When DNACPR will not be successful <\/h5><br \/>If the medical team have decided that a cardiac or respiratory arrest is likely, but CPR is unlikely to be effective and may cause unnecessary trauma, you must decide whether to inform the patient of the DNACPR decision. Some patients may want to know this information, whilst others may prefer to remain ignorant. You should carefully explore the patient's ideas and expectations regarding this area of their care to determine the level of information they want to know. It is then their leading clinician's responsibility to inform them to an appropriate level. This also involves answering any questions they may have, regardless of whether this is a difficult conversation to have. If your patient wants to remain ignorant of this information, you should seek permission to share this information with their next of kin and relevant family members. This is the same for patients that lack capacity. You should also inform any legal proxy involved with these patients. <br \/><br \/><br \/><h5 class='notes-heading'>When CPR may be successful <\/h5><br \/>If the healthcare team determines that CPR may be effective in a patient, the benefits of prolonging their life (and the quality of this life) must be weighed against the risks of CPR. This discussion can include the patient, and they should be offered the opportunity to voice their opinion on this matter and ask any questions that they may have. This is a sensitive topic and must be done by the right people, at the right time and in the right environment. Even with the right circumstances, some patients may not want to be involved in this discussion, and that's ok. However, if they do want to be involved you must inform them of the likely outcomes of CPR, the risks involved in the procedure and an explanation about the potential need for other invasive treatments as a result of successful CPR e.g. ventilation. In some cases, these additional invasive treatments may not be deemed appropriate, despite successful CPR. The patient should be informed of the opinion of the healthcare team regarding the likelihood of success of CPR. <br \/><br \/>There are some patients who wish to receive CPR despite there only being a small chance of success. This is despite being informed of the risks of CPR and the opinions of the healthcare team. In these cases, you must ensure that the patient has definitely been adequately informed of the risks of CPR, their likely level of recovery and length of possible survival. If they still want to have CPR, you should discuss the reasons for the request and try to come to a compromise. For example, in some patients, you may be able to agree on limited CPR interventions if the need ever arose. However, if the healthcare team decide that CPR is in no way clinically appropriate, you are not obliged to agree to attempt CPR. This is ultimately a medical decision. However, the patient should be informed of this and they should be given an explanation as to why this is the case. They are allowed to seek a second opinion if they wish. When the benefits versus the risks are very similar, the patient normally has the final decision. <br \/><br \/>As is standard in decisions regarding medical treatment in patients that don't have capacity, the following guidance applies:<br \/><ul><li>you should first attempt to consult the patient's relevant legal proxy. This is the person that is legally chosen to make medical decisions for the patient<\/li><li>if there is no legal proxy, you must discuss the decision with the patient's next of kin and relevant close family members<\/li><li>during these discussions, you must make the relevant parties aware of the role that they are playing in this discussion. If they are not a legal proxy, their role is to advise the healthcare team of what they believe would be the choice of the patient. However, it is not their decision to decide whether CPR is the appropriate clinical decision<\/li><li>these parties must be informed of the same information about CPR regarding risks, likelihood of success and potential level of disability after the CPR. <\/li><li>if the legal proxy decides that they wish the patient to received CPR despite a low chance of success, the same rules apply as in the previous paragraph. You must explore these decisions, attempt to reach a consensus or a compromise, and if this is not possible, explain to them that you are not obliged to carry out CPR in this case. They also have a right to seek a second opinion<\/li><\/ul><br \/><br \/><h5 class='notes-heading'>Resolving disagreements <\/h5><br \/>If there is a disagreement about a DNACPR order, the healthcare team should attempt to resolve it to the best of their ability. If this is not possible, legal frameworks should be consulted and advice should be sought. <br \/><br \/><br \/><h5 class='notes-heading'>Recording and communicating CPR decisions <\/h5><br \/>Any discussions regarding DNACPR with a patient, their legal proxy or those close to them should be recorded in the patient notes. Any decisions should be written as an advance care plan, and the relevant DNACPR forms should be completed. <br \/><br \/><br \/><h5 class='notes-heading'>Treatment and care after a DNACPR decision <\/h5><br \/>It must be explicit to the patient, the family and the healthcare team that a DNACPR order solely refers to CPR and does not impact on the initiation of any other treatments, medications or interventions. Decisions regarding this aspect of the patient's care will be decided as a separate issue with its own set of discussions. <br \/><br \/>A DNACPR decision does not override clinical judgement if a cardiac or respiratory arrest occurs from an unexpected source e.g. due to the induction of anaesthesia. These circumstances are reversible and not due to overall health status or comorbidity, and were not planned or discussed during the DNACPR decision.<br \/><br \/><h5 class='notes-heading'>Emergencies and CPR <\/h5><br \/>If cardiac or respiratory arrest occurs in an unexpected circumstance, e.g. an emergency, then there is often times when no DNACPR discussion has taken place, and no decision has been made. In this case, CPR should be attempted unless there is sufficient information to suggest that it will most likely not be successful.","notes_hash":"54d889426570f9a6a7f505cb67a82637","knowledge_graph_node_id_link":0,"links":"<table style='width:100%'><tr><td>GMC<\/td><td style = \"float: right;width:115px;\"><button type=\"button\" style=\"\" id=\"link_like_1412\" data-linkid=\"1412\" data-rating=\"1\" class=\"rate-link btn btn-link\"><svg class=\"bi bi-hand-thumbs-up\" width=\"16\" height=\"16\"><use xlink:href=\"#icon-hand-thumbs-up\"\/><\/svg><\/button><span id=\"link_good_count_1412\" class = \"link_good_count\" style=\"color:green; font-size:85%;\">0<\/span><button type=\"button\" style=\"\" id=\"link_dislike_1412\" data-linkid=\"1412\" data-rating=\"0\" class=\"rate-link btn btn-link\"><svg class=\"bi bi-hand-thumbs-down\" width=\"16\" height=\"16\"><use xlink:href=\"#icon-hand-thumbs-down\"\/><\/svg><\/button><span id=\"link_bad_count_1412\" class = \"link_bad_count\" style=\"color:red; font-size:85%;\">0<\/span><\/td><\/tr><tr><td colspan=\"2\"><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https:\/\/www.gmc-uk.org\/ethical-guidance\/ethical-guidance-for-doctors\/treatment-and-care-towards-the-end-of-life\/cardiopulmonary-resuscitation-cpr\">GMC: Treatment and care towards the end of life - Cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR)<\/a><\/td><\/tr><\/table>","media":"","concepts_for_notes":[],"category_name":"All","subcategory_name":"","comment_count":0},"",[]]
