[{"notes_id":"1_2786","category":"1","subcategory":"0","title":"GMC: Confidentiality - Using and disclosing patient information for direct care","body":"Sharing patient information is vital for safe and effective care. This is particularly vital when working within multi-disciplinary teams, given that all members must have access to the information that they require for their role. Part of our duty as medical professionals is to ensure that information is only shared in a way that is both legal and ethical, whilst facilitating access to those who require it. <br \/><br \/>The consequences of inappropriate sharing of information can be significant, for both the clinician\/ patient relationship and the wider profession. There have been many media examples of inappropriate information sharing, and being aware of the relevant guidelines is crucial for avoiding this.<br \/><br \/>General principles:<br \/><ul><li>Most patients expect that some information will be shared with those who are directly involved in their care. Unless the patient specifically objects, this is considered implied consent.<\/li><li>If a patient objects to particular personal information being shared, you should not disclose the information. The exceptions are: if it is justified for the public interest (as detailed below) or the patient lacks capacity.<\/li><li>You should explain to the patient the potential consequences of not allowing personal information to be shared and reach a compromise where possible.<\/li><li>In cases where a patient cannot be informed about information sharing, such as an emergency setting, you should pass relevant information to those providing the patient's care.<\/li><\/ul><br \/>Naturally, on entry to the hospital, patients may be unable to explicitly state their consent for information sharing. It is therefore easy to forget that they may wish to withhold some details. Wherever possible, it is good practice to discuss with the patient any concerns which they may have. In many cases, these concerns can be rectified without a need to breach confidentiality. This is the ideal scenario, as it helps to maintain transparency between the doctor and patient.<br \/><br \/>Conditions for sharing information:<br \/><ul><li>You must be accessing the information to support the patient's direct care, or be satisfied that it is being shared for that purpose.<\/li><li>Patients should be kept informed regarding how their personal information will be used. It should be clear that they have the right to object.<\/li><li>You must have no reason to believe the patient has objected to the information being shared.<\/li><li>You must be satisfied that anyone you disclose the information to understands that you are giving it to them in confidence.<\/li><\/ul><br \/>On a busy ward, there may be times where you are asked to share information about a patient. It is important to always check how this information will be used and to ensure that you are satisfied that it is for the patient's care- for example, sharing information with another department or speciality. Failure to do so could lead to this information falling into the wrong hands. The patient should also be given the opportunity to object to this information being passed further. <br \/><br \/>Sharing information with friends or relatives:<br \/><ul><li>Establish the patient's wishes as early as possible regarding whether they wish to have friends or relatives informed about their care.<\/li><li>Do not assume that a patient agrees to the disclosure simply because they have a close relationship with the person who is seeking information. You should gain explicit consent.<\/li><li>When a patient lacks capacity, it may be necessary to share some relevant information with friends\/ relatives. This does not entitle the person to full access to the patient's clinical records, but can be used to help assess the patient's best interests. <\/li><\/ul><br \/>We often assume that a patient will want their family to be involved in their care, and this is often an important feature of palliative and elderly care. Despite this, the patient should still be given their own autonomy over the decision. There may even be exceptions where sharing personal information could put the patient in emotional or physical danger e.g. cases of abuse. Every patient and family is different, and part of the clinician's role is to respect and facilitate this.<br \/><br \/>If someone close to the patient wants to discuss their concerns about the patient's health\/ wellbeing without involving the patient, you should still listen. The information they give you may be helpful in caring for the patient- particularly in cases of mental ill-health. This does not mean that you are obligated to act on the information received, but it may assist in building a clinical picture.<br \/><br \/>Considerations if a patient lacks capacity:<br \/><ul><li>Consider if all possible attempts have been made to explain the disclosure to the patient, using methods and language which they can understand.<\/li><li>Consider whether the lack of capacity is temporary or permanent and whether the decision can wait until the patient regains capacity.<\/li><li>Consider if the patient has already stated their wishes regarding information being disclosed, in addition to their apparent beliefs and values.<\/li><li>Consider if the patient has nominated a person to make health or welfare decisions on their behalf.<\/li><li>If a patient asks you not to disclose personal information and you believe they lack the capacity to make this decision, you should try to persuade them to allow an appropriate person to be given relevant information. In some cases, disclosure will be required or necessary e.g. under mental health and mental capacity laws. <\/li><\/ul><br \/>When dealing with patients who lack capacity, reflect back to the specific GMC guidance on mental capacity. The main features involve providing the patient with maximal opportunity to state their interests, before making decisions on their behalf. In these cases, also consider if the patient has an appointed person to make decisions on their behalf.<br \/><br \/><h5 class='notes-heading'>Disclosures by Law<\/h5><br \/>You must not disclose information to a third party without the patient's express consent- unless it is required by law or can be justified in the public interest. It is rare that a disclosure will be required by law, but some examples of these exceptions are detailed below:<br \/><ul><li>Following an order made by a judge or presiding officer of a court.<\/li><li>In certain cases of <span class=\"concept\" data-cid=\"10939\">communicable disease<\/span>, when you must inform the local authority.<\/li><li>To prevent an act of <span class=\"concept\" data-cid=\"10940\">terrorism<\/span>.<\/li><li>To <span class=\"concept\" data-cid=\"10941\">comply with a statutory request made by a regulatory body such as the GMC<\/span>. <\/li><\/ul><br \/>There are exceptional circumstances where information sharing is not so straight-forward, and one of these relates to gunshot wounds and knife injuries:<br \/><ul><li>Gunshot wounds and those caused by a blade\/ sharp instrument represent a special category of injury. <\/li><li>The police should usually be informed whenever a person presents with a gunshot wound, given the potential risk to others. <\/li><li>They should also be informed of most knife injuries- unless the injury appears to be accidental or a result of self-harm. <\/li><li>Personal information (such as the patient's name and address) should not be disclosed in the initial contact with the police, and the police will respond even if the patient's identity is not disclosed.<\/li><\/ul>","notes_hash":"130721beed98ebf60b9b5c08b8126eea","knowledge_graph_node_id_link":0,"links":"<table style='width:100%'><tr><td>GMC<\/td><td style = \"float: right;width:115px;\"><button type=\"button\" style=\"\" id=\"link_like_1381\" data-linkid=\"1381\" data-rating=\"1\" class=\"rate-link btn btn-link\"><svg class=\"bi bi-hand-thumbs-up\" width=\"16\" height=\"16\"><use xlink:href=\"#icon-hand-thumbs-up\"\/><\/svg><\/button><span id=\"link_good_count_1381\" class = \"link_good_count\" style=\"color:green; font-size:85%;\">0<\/span><button type=\"button\" style=\"\" id=\"link_dislike_1381\" data-linkid=\"1381\" data-rating=\"0\" class=\"rate-link btn btn-link\"><svg class=\"bi bi-hand-thumbs-down\" width=\"16\" height=\"16\"><use xlink:href=\"#icon-hand-thumbs-down\"\/><\/svg><\/button><span id=\"link_bad_count_1381\" class = \"link_bad_count\" style=\"color:red; font-size:85%;\">0<\/span><\/td><\/tr><tr><td colspan=\"2\"><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https:\/\/www.gmc-uk.org\/ethical-guidance\/ethical-guidance-for-doctors\/confidentiality\/using-and-disclosing-patient-information-for-direct-care\">Using and disclosing patient information for direct care <\/a><\/td><\/tr><\/table>","media":"","concepts_for_notes":[],"category_name":"All","subcategory_name":"","comment_count":2},"",[]]
