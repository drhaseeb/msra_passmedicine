[{"notes_id":"1_2788","category":"1","subcategory":"0","title":"GMC: Confidentiality - Using and disclosing patient information for secondary purposes","body":"There are occasions where sharing patient information is beneficial for healthcare. There are also cases where information needs to be disclosed for justice and financial purposes. It is important to be aware of when consent is required, and what to do if information is requested.<br \/><br \/>You may disclose personal information without breaching duties of confidentiality when any of the following circumstances apply:<br \/><ul><li>The patient has given explicit consent <\/li><li>The disclosure is required by law, including by the courts <\/li><li>The disclosure can be justified in the public interest<\/li><li>The disclosure is approved through a statutory process that sets aside the common law duty of confidentiality <\/li><\/ul><br \/>Anonymised information is preferred wherever possible, and is usually be sufficient (if the information is not being used in the direct care of the patient). Anonymity means ensuring that the data is not patient-identifiable.<br \/><br \/><h5 class='notes-heading'> Legal Disclosures: <\/h5><br \/>There are laws which require disclosure of patient information. The purposes can include: <br \/><ul><li>The notification of infectious diseases<\/li><li>The provision of health and social care services <\/li><li>The prevention of terrorism and the investigation of road accidents. <\/li><\/ul><br \/>The courts, both civil and criminal, have powers to order this disclosure. You must disclose information if ordered to do so by a judge or presiding officer of a court. You must not disclose personal information to a third party such as a solicitor, police officer or officer of a court without the patient's explicit consent. <br \/>NB: you can disclose information without consent to your own legal adviser to get their advice.<br \/><br \/><h5 class='notes-heading'> Clinical Audits <\/h5><br \/>Doctors have a duty to participate in clinical audits and to contribute to clinical outcome review programmes. If an audit is to be carried out, you may disclose personal information on the basis of implied consent as long as the patient:<br \/><ul><li>Has not objected<\/li><li>Has ready access to information that explains that their personal information may be disclosed for local clinical audit, and they have the right to object<\/li><\/ul><br \/>If a patient objects to information about them being included in a local clinical audit, you should explain why the information is needed and how this may benefit their current and future care. If the patient still objects, you should remove them from the audit if practical.<br \/><br \/><h5 class='notes-heading'> Public Interest <\/h5><br \/>In exceptional circumstances, there may be a public interest in disclosing personal information without consent. The benefits to society must outweigh the patient's interest in keeping the information confidential. If you know that a patient has objected to information being disclosed for purposes other than their own care, you should not disclose information in the public interest <b> unless <\/b> failure to do so would leave others at risk of serious harm.<br \/><br \/>When considering whether disclosing personal information may be justified in the public interest, you must be satisfied that:<br \/><ul><li>The disclosure is the minimum necessary for the purpose.<\/li><li>The disclosure would comply with the requirements of data protection law and would not breach any other legislation that prevents the disclosure of information about patients.<\/li><li>The information will be processed in a secure and controlled environment.<\/li><li>Information is readily available to patients about any data that has been disclosed without consent, who it has been disclosed to, and the purpose of the disclosure.<\/li><\/ul><br \/><h5 class='notes-heading'> Other Key Points <\/h5><br \/>If you are asked to disclose information about a patient for financial or administrative purposes, you should aim to give it in an anonymised form. If identifiable information is needed, you must be satisfied that there is a legal basis for breaching confidentiality.<br \/><br \/>If the patient has died or is unlikely to regain capacity, it may be appropriate to speak to those close to the patient. However, if a patient has previously asked you not to share personal information about their condition or treatment, you should abide by this.<br \/><br \/>Statutory arrangements are in place for considering whether disclosure would benefit the public sufficiently to outweigh patients' right to privacy. These purposes include medical research and the management of services. You should only disclose personal information for research if there is a legal basis for the disclosure and the research has been approved by a research ethics committee.<br \/><br \/>Third parties, such as a patient's insurer or employer may ask you for personal information. In these cases, you should:<br \/><ul><li>Be satisfied that the patient has sufficient information about the scope, purpose and likely consequences of the examination and disclosure.<\/li><li>Obtain or have seen written consent to the disclosure from the patient or a person properly authorised to act on the patient's behalf.<\/li><li>Only disclose factual information you can substantiate, presented in an unbiased manner, which is relevant to the request.<\/li><\/ul><br \/><b> References <\/b><br \/>GMC.
