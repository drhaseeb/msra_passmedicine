[{"notes_id":"1_2805","category":"1","subcategory":"0","title":"GMC: Protecting children and young people - Confidentiality and sharing information","body":"Patient confidentiality is crucial for building and maintaining trust and is therefore essential to the patient-doctor relationship. There are times, however, when it is necessary to break confidentiality, particularly where there are children involved.<br \/><br \/>Doctors are required to inform a relevant agency (such as the police or social services) where there is concern that a child or young person is currently suffering abuse or neglect, or is at risk of suffering abuse or neglect. This concern may arise from a consultation with the child or young person themselves, or a consultation with someone close to them. <br \/><br \/>This guidance about breaking confidentiality is different to that regarding adults. For example, if a woman presents to the surgery and makes a disclosure of domestic violence, the doctor is not required to inform local services if the patient does not wish them to. However, if there are children in the home and the patient suggests that her partner is also violent towards the children, a local agency must be informed.<br \/><br \/>Wherever possible, consent to disclose the relevant information should be obtained from the patient. This should involve explaining the following:<br \/><ul><li>what information will be shared<\/li><li>who it will be shared with<\/li><li>how the information will be used<\/li><li>who they can go to for independent advice and support <\/li><\/ul><br \/>However, <b> consent should not be sought if this may put the child at greater risk <\/b> and <b> disclosure of information should not be delayed whilst consent is sought. <\/b><br \/><br \/>When informing an appropriate agency about concerns, the following information should be provided:<br \/><ul><li>the identities of the child or young person, their parents and any other people that may pose a risk to them<\/li><li>the reasons for your concerns, including any relevant information about the child's health and any relevant information about the parents or carers<\/li><\/ul><br \/>Doctors should always follow up their concerns and escalate to the next level of authority if they believe that the concerns are not being addressed appropriately.<br \/><br \/><h5 class='notes-heading'> Example 1 <\/h5><br \/>A 28-year-old woman presents to her general practitioner with facial swelling and bruising. On questioning, she reveals that her partner kicked her in the face during an argument. She states that he has also been aggressive to her two young children, once threatening her 3-year-old son with a knife. However, she begs you not to inform the police or social services, as she says she has the situation under control. <br \/><br \/><b> Explanation: <\/b> In this situation, the general practitioner <u> must <\/u> inform social services immediately, or contact the police if they believe the children to be at risk of immediate harm. During the consultation, the GP should discuss with the patient what information they will be sharing, who they will be sharing it with and how the information will be used (ie what is likely to be the outcome of sharing this information). The doctor should also share the contact information for a local domestic abuse charity with the patient so that she can seek immediate advice and support if she wishes. <br \/><br \/><b> Example 2 <\/b> <br \/><br \/>The scenario is the same as above, except the patient threatens to move both the children and her abusive partner to her sister's home in France if the general practitioner informs social services or the police.<br \/><br \/><b> Explanation: <\/b> In this scenario, it would be dangerous to inform the patient that you will be passing information onto the relevant agencies, as this would endanger the children. Therefore, the GP should immediately inform social services and\/or the police <u> without <\/u> first informing the mother.","notes_hash":"806aa6e9474e353c16b47d1364ec79f0","knowledge_graph_node_id_link":0,"links":"<table style='width:100%'><tr><td>GMC<\/td><td style = \"float: right;width:115px;\"><button type=\"button\" style=\"\" id=\"link_like_1409\" data-linkid=\"1409\" data-rating=\"1\" class=\"rate-link btn btn-link\"><svg class=\"bi bi-hand-thumbs-up\" width=\"16\" height=\"16\"><use xlink:href=\"#icon-hand-thumbs-up\"\/><\/svg><\/button><span id=\"link_good_count_1409\" class = \"link_good_count\" style=\"color:green; font-size:85%;\">0<\/span><button type=\"button\" style=\"\" id=\"link_dislike_1409\" data-linkid=\"1409\" data-rating=\"0\" class=\"rate-link btn btn-link\"><svg class=\"bi bi-hand-thumbs-down\" width=\"16\" height=\"16\"><use xlink:href=\"#icon-hand-thumbs-down\"\/><\/svg><\/button><span id=\"link_bad_count_1409\" class = \"link_bad_count\" style=\"color:red; font-size:85%;\">0<\/span><\/td><\/tr><tr><td colspan=\"2\"><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https:\/\/www.gmc-uk.org\/ethical-guidance\/ethical-guidance-for-doctors\/protecting-children-and-young-people\/confidentiality-and-sharing-information\">GMC: Protecting children and young people - Confidentiality and sharing information<\/a><\/td><\/tr><\/table>","media":"","concepts_for_notes":[],"category_name":"All","subcategory_name":"","comment_count":0},"",[]]
