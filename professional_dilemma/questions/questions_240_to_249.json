Refusing to treat her is blackmail and clearly unacceptable.<br /><br />The best response is to explore why she doesn't want to tell her previous or current partners. This may lead to a discussion where you are able to allay her fears. The second approach, whilst likely to represent a factual statement, is less likely to get to the bottom of the problem.<br /><br />If she feels she cannot face telling anyone then it would be worthwhile recommending that she suggests to her current partner that they go for a 'check up'. This would at least ensure the current partner is treated, although it would not deal with the former partner.<br /><br />Refusing to treat her is a bad option as it is denying a patient medical care, as well as being a form of blackmail.<br /><br />Giving her a tablet of azithromycin to give her partner is the worst option.

        "question_notes": "A key concept here is to treat her regardless of whether she 'cooperates' and gives you the names of her previous partners. Refusing to treat her is blackmail and clearly unacceptable.<br /><br />The best response is to explore why she doesn't want to tell her previous or current partners. This may lead to a discussion where you are able to allay her fears. The second approach, whilst likely to represent a factual statement, is less likely to get to the bottom of the problem.<br /><br />If she feels she cannot face telling anyone then it would be worthwhile recommending that she suggests to her current partner that they go for a 'check up'. This would at least ensure the current partner is treated, although it would not deal with the former partner.<br /><br />Refusing to treat her is a bad option as it is denying a patient medical care, as well as being a form of blackmail.<br /><br />Giving her a tablet of azithromycin to give her partner is the worst option. You have no information regarding his medical history or allergies.",

These are likely the cause of this patient's rash. This question relates to duty of candour; in Good Medical Practice (2013), the GMC state clearly that healthcare professionals must be clear with a patient when something goes wrong. This includes telling the patient what has gone wrong, apologising and offering an appropriate remedy. This guidance still stands even if the patient has not come to harm. The fact that this patient is already planning to put in a complaint is irrelevant and certainly not a reason to withhold information. The most appropriate option is therefore to <b> advise the patient of what has happened, apologise, review his rash and change his antibiotics</b>.<br /><br /><b>Advise the patient of what has happened, review his rash, change his antibiotics, and suggest that he lodges a formal complaint</b> is the next best option.

However, in this scenario, the doctor does not apologise, and instead directs the patient directly to the route of a formal complaint. Part of duty of candour is apologising for mistakes.

However, it fails to take into account duty of candour. The doctor has not admitted that incorrect antibiotics were given and instead provides a generic suggestion for the rash that does not involve the team's mistake. <br /><br /><b>Cross off the cotrimoxazole and prescribe a different antibiotic alongside an antihistamine for the patient's rash</b> deals with the immediate problem of the patient being prescribed a drug to which he is allergic, although it does not involve reviewing the patient and ensuring he has not suffered further adverse effects.
