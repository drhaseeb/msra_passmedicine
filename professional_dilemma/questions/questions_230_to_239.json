This is not always easy, particularly as a student or junior doctor- which is why it is important to be aware of the guidance. <br /><br /><h5 class='notes-heading'> Broad Principles </h5><br />All doctors have the duty to raise concerns if they believe that patient safety or care is being compromised. This can include when medical students witness poor practice on placement, or family members raise concerns. They must also encourage and support a culture in which staff can raise concerns openly and safely. <br /><br />Concerns may relate to:<br /><ul><li>The practice of colleagues,</li><li>The systems in place, </li><li>Policies and procedures within organisations.</li></ul><br />You may be reluctant to report a concern for a number of reasons, particularly if you have not needed to raise concerns in the past. For example:<br /><ul><li>You fear that nothing will be done,</li><li>You fear that raising your concern may cause problems for colleagues,</li><li>It could have a negative effect on working relationships or career,</li><li>It could result in a complaint about you.</li></ul><br />While it is natural to have these concerns, keep the following in mind:<br /><ul><li>You have a duty to put patients' interests first and act to protect them. This should override personal and professional loyalties.</li><li>The law provides legal protection. This is against victimisation or dismissal for individuals who reveal information to raise genuine concerns and expose malpractice in the workplace.</li><li><span class=\"concept\" data-cid=\"12194\">You do not need to wait for proof</span>. You can justify raising a concern if you do so honestly, on the basis of reasonable belief and through appropriate channels.  </li></ul><br />For example, you may believe that a member of staff is intentionally avoiding guidance on hand-washing. When reporting this, you must be clear, honest and objective about the reason for your concern. You should also keep a record of any steps that you have taken to deal with it.<br /><br /><h5 class='notes-heading'> Who to report to </h5><br />Wherever possible, you should first raise your concern with your manager or an appropriate officer, such as:<br /><ul><li>The consultant in charge of the team, </li><li>The clinical or medical director,</li><li>A practice partner. </li></ul><br />NB: If your concern is about a partner, it may be appropriate to raise it outside the practice. <br /><br />If you are a doctor in training, it may be appropriate to raise your concerns with a named person in the deanery. One example could be where a senior clinician has been reported by a number of patients for improper practice, and you would like to seek further advise on what action to take.<br /><br />You should contact a regulatory body, such as the General Medical Council, in the following circumstances. <br /><ul><li>If you cannot raise the issue with the responsible person or body locally because you believe them to be part of the problem.</li><li>If you have raised your concern through local channels but are not satisfied that the responsible person or body has taken adequate action.</li><li>If there is an immediate serious risk to patients, and a regulator or other external body has responsibility to act or intervene.</li></ul><br />It is not common to raise concerns publicly, as they can usually be dealt with discretely by the appropriate team. However, you can consider making your concerns public if you:<br /><ul><li>Have done all you can to deal with any concern by raising it within the organisation in which you work or which you have contract with, or with the appropriate external body, and</li><li>Have good reason to believe that patients are still at risk of harm,</li><li>Do not breach patient confidentiality.</li></ul><br /><h5 class='notes-heading'> Acting on Concerns </h5><br />As a medical student or recently qualified doctor, you may not need to do more than report concerns. However, concerns about patient safety can also come from a number of sources, such as:<br /><ul><li>Patients' complaints, </li><li>Colleagues' concerns, </li><li>Critical incident reports,</li><li>Clinical audit. </li></ul><br />If you receive this information, you have a responsibility to act on it promptly and professionally. You can do this by putting the matter right (if possible), investigating and dealing with it locally, or referring serious or repeated incidents to senior management.<br /><br />If you have a management role or responsibility, you must make sure that:<br /><ul><li>There are systems and policies in place to allow concerns and investigated promptly and fully,</li><li>You do not try to prevent employees or former employees raising concerns about patient safety,</li><li>Clinical staff understand their duty to be open and honest about incidents or complaints with both patients and managers,</li><li>Staff who raise a concern are protected from unfair criticism or action, including any detriment or dismissal.</li></ul><br />If you are responsible for investigating incidents or complaints, you must:<br /><ul><li>Tell the person what action has been taken to prevent a recurrence of the problem,</li><li>Outline the process if they are still not satisfied with the response, </li><li>Ensure that any investigations or resulting actions are carried out in a way which is consistent with the law.</li></ul>",
