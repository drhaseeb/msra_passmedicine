They have ultimate responsibility for the patient's care and should be informed if the on-call team are having difficulty managing the patient. <br /><br />The Clinical Director of the hospital may be able to liaise between the different members of the health care team but the problem should be escalated within your own team first.<br /><br />The physio may be experienced in providing NIV but it is ultimately a medical decision about whether to start a treatment. <br /><br />Accepting her opinion is a poor option as she has not reviewed the patient herself and is only giving an opinion on the basis of blood gases.<br /><br />Setting up NIV equipment requires training. If done incorrectly it could potentially harm a patient.",
