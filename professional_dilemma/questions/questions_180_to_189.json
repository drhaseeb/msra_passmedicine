        "title": "GMC: Consent - Making decisions about investigations and treatment",
        "body": "The GMC provides in-depth guidance on gaining consent from patients for treatment. When referring to treatment, not just invasive or dangerous procedures such as surgery are taken into account but all forms of treatment including changes to medication or how to investigate a condition. The guidance explains how and what information should be shared with patients to gain consent, who can make decisions on their behalf if a patient cannot and how consent is expressed and recorded.<br /><br />Providing information:<br /><ul><li>You should explain all the available treatment options to the patient and the benefits and risks of each treatment</li><li>If you think a treatment is more appropriate you should make a recommendation but ensure you do not bias the patient or coerce them into choosing your preference for treatment</li><li>When discussing the risks of a treatment you should provide information regarding any risks which would be relevant to the patient; this may be both because they are serious but rare or because they are common but less significant</li><li>You are obliged to ensure the patient is aware of the risks of a procedure unless they have specifically asked not to be informed; do not assume they would not want to know</li><li>Even when patients request that information is withheld, you must still ensure that they are aware of the risks associated with any treatment so consent can be obtained</li><li>You can only withhold information when it would cause 'significant harm' to the patient when giving it; there needs to be evidence, not just a doctor's feeling that it would upset or dissuade a patient</li><li>You should answer any questions honestly and as fully as you can, even if you think this will result in them withdrawing consent for a procedure</li></ul><br />Explaining risks:<br /><ul><li>The discussion should be tailored to the individual and risks adjusted based on their co-morbidities and personal background as appropriate</li><li>You must always explain side-effects and possible complications of a treatment as well as the risk of failure of treatment</li></ul><br />Obtaining and recording consent:<br /><ul><li>You must document in the medical records that a patient has consented to a treatment based on the information given to them; you must record the benefits and risks you have explained</li><li>This must be done both for trivial treatments such as a new oral medication as well as more significant treatments such as surgical procedures</li><li>Written consent should be obtained for procedures with significant risk or significant impact on the patient's social situation to formally document the conversation regarding benefits and risks. This should be in addition to recording in the medical records that they have given consent</li><li>You are legally required to gain written consent for fertility treatment</li><li>Where possible, the patient should be provided with written information regarding the risks and benefits discussed if the treatment is significant; this may include a copy of a consent form or clinic letter or a leaflet with further information</li><li>In the case of patients under 16, consent must be sought from the parents and their written consent must be documented</li></ul><br />Non-competent patients:<br /><ul><li><span class=\"concept\" data-cid=\"11865\">Any patient who cannot consent for themselves, either due to a reduced conscious level or a cognitive impairment, can still have treatment in their best interests</span></li><li>The reasons for carrying out the procedure must be clearly documented</li></ul><br /><h5 class='notes-heading'>Examples</h5><br /><i>A 46-year-old woman is going to undertake a prophylactic mastectomy for familial breast cancer</i><br /><ul><li>Ideally, in this situation you would consent her days to weeks prior to the procedure to ensure she has time to ask questions and consider her decision to undergo the procedure</li><li>You should gain separate written consent (i.e. complete a consent form) as well as documenting the conversation regarding risks and benefits and her expressing consent in the medical notes</li><li>The benefits and reasons for the procedure, the risks of the procedure itself, possible post-operative complications and the possibility of failure of treatment should all be discussed and documented</li></ul><br /><i>A 91-year-old man attends his GP to have his diabetic medications adjusted</i><br /><ul><li>While much less significant than a surgical procedure, you should still document the patient's consent to undergo further treatment for their diabetes in the medical notes; this can be as simple as noting they agree to change medications or doses</li><li>You should provide him with all the options available and allow him to make a choice based on the side effects and benefits of each medication</li><li>You can recommend a specific drug if you feel it is best and give your reasons for this recommendation but if he wishes to choose another treatment and decline your recommendation then you must not coerce him into following your advice</li></ul><br /><i>A 14-year-old girl is brought to the emergency department unconscious after a head injury and requires emergency neurosurgery for a life-threatening intracranial bleed</i><br /><ul><li>There are two important rules to note here which is that as the patient is under 16, responsibility to consent for procedures is deferred to the parents as the law assumes she does not have the capacity to con</td><td>Consent - Making decisions about investigations and treatmentsent for herself and that as this is an emergency and she is unconscious, a procedure can be done in a patient's best interests without obtaining consent</li><li>It would be reasonable to either discuss the procedure with her parents and gain consent from them for emergency surgery or to perform the surgery without seeking consent but to discuss the surgical plan with the parents as the relatives as you would if the patient was an adult and able to consent for themselves</li><li>The risks of the procedure should be explained but the key difference in explaining them here is that without surgery the patient is likely to die and so any post-operative complications are less serious than the risks of continuing without surgery</li><li>Time pressures mean all questions may need to be answered immediately and it is good practice to document what questions were asked of you by the relatives if any and your answers at the time; often people do not have questions and you should also document this if it is the case</li><li>The full discussion with the parents should be fully documented in the medical records including the main risks of performing surgery as well as the likely outcome without operative management and that formal consent from the patient themselves cannot be sought with the reasons why documented clearly</li></ul><br /><i>A 51-year-old man is having a benign skin lesion removed for cosmetic purposes</i><br /><ul><li>These cases where the procedure is not being carried out to increase function / prevent disability or preserve life are where consent should be most detailed</li><li>The benefits should be clearly listed and when discussing risks, usual surgical effects such as pain and scarring should be explained and consented for as these may cause the patient to not give consent for a purely cosmetic procedure</li><li>The consent process should ideally be over a number of consultations with consent being taken in advance of the procedure and confirmed on the day to ensure the patient has had time to ask any questions and is fully aware of the risks before undergoing the procedure</li></ul>",
