This domain focuses on the standards expected of doctors in areas such as communication and collaboration with patients and colleagues.<br /><br />Effective communication<br /><ul><li>Listen to patients and answer any questions honestly</li><li>Ensure that information is delivered in a manner that can be understood. Identify and apply practical measures to overcome any communication and language barriers</li><li>Provide support and information to patients' relatives or carers in a considerate manner</li><li>Doctors on duty need to be easily reachable by their patients and colleagues for any advice or support </li></ul><br />Partnership with patients<br /><ul><li>Empower patients with the information required for patients to make decisions with regards to their care. This includes information on the clinical conditions, treatment options and the relevant risks and uncertainties</li><li>Ensure that patients are aware of the progress of their care</li><li>The roles and responsibilities of each member of the team need to be made clear to the patients</li><li>Patient confidentiality needs to be maintained, even after the patient is deceased </li></ul><br />Fair and respectful care of all patients<br /><ul><li>Respect patients' dignity and privacy </li><li>Respect any health, cultural and religious beliefs held by the patients, even if they do not agree with yours. </li></ul><br />If you have a conscientious objection to a particular procedure e.g. abortion, you need to:<br /><ul><li>Inform the patient that they have the right to see another practitioner</li><li>Provide the necessary information and support towards the patient seeking another doctor. In doing so, refrain from expressing disapproval of the patient's lifestyle, choices or beliefs</li><li>Find another doctor to substitute you if it is not practical for the patient to arrange to see another doctor</li></ul><br />Partnership with colleagues<br /><ul><li>Doctors are expected to work in a team in a manner that serves patients' best interest</li><li>It is important to respect the skills and contributions of every member of the team and be fair to every member of the team </li><li>Understand that your actions may affect others within and outside the team </li><li>It is your duty to complete any post that you have formally accepted as leaving the post assigned to you may compromise patient safety especially if this creates a gap in the medical rota</li><li>Unless the trust has a reasonable time to make adjustments, it is important that you work the hours required of your contract before leaving a job</li></ul><br />Coordination of care between healthcare providers and between health and social care providers. This include <br /><ul><li>Providing all relevant information to all clinicians or social care providers involved in the care of the patients  </li><li>Checking that a named doctor or team has taken over the care </li><li>Ensure that the clinician filling in for you or taking over the care is appropriately trained to provide safe care for the patient </li></ul><br />The Good Medical Practice also made statements with regards to Doctors as teachers. It recommends that doctors support the training and teaching of junior staff members and medical students*. This includes<br /><ul><li>Ensuring adequate supervision</li><li>Writing honest feedback/references/appraisals on their competence, performance and conduct</li><li>Being a mentor</li><li>Supporting those who are struggling with their performance or health</li></ul><br />*In all circumstances, patient safety needs to be prioritised",

            "<b>Speak to the registrar privately, outline your concerns about potential patient identification and unprofessional content, and ask them to remove the episodes</b> is most appropriate. Your first duty is to protect patients and prevent further harm. GMC guidance on confidentiality and doctors\u2019 use of social media states you must not disclose information that could identify patients\u2014even if names are changed. A discreet, proportionate approach respects the colleague\u2019s dignity, may rapidly contain risk (by removing content), and models professional behaviour.<br /><br /><b>Review the specific episode(s), note time-stamps and potentially identifying details, and check local social-media/information governance policy to frame a clear concern</b> is most appropriate. Raising concerns should be honest, fair, and evidence-based. Minimal fact-checking (without circulating the content) ensures accuracy and helps you describe the risk precisely to seniors/information governance. This avoids gossip and aligns with GMC expectations around fairness and probity.<br /><br /><b>Escalate through your line manager/clinical lead or Freedom to Speak Up Guardian) and follow the organisation\u2019s information-governance policy</b> is most appropriate. Potential breaches of confidentiality and professionalism require prompt escalation so the trust can assess risk, involve information governance/legal/comms, and coordinate remedial actions. GMC guidance is clear: act without delay when patient safety or public trust may be at risk, and use formal channels.<br /><br />The remaining options are inappropriate/less appropriate:<br /><br /><b>Post a warning in the staff WhatsApp with a link to the podcast so others \u201csee the problem\u201d</b> is inappropriate. Broadcasting/resharing the content amplifies the breach and risks further disclosure. Use official channels and the principle of minimum necessary disclosure.<br /><br /><b>Leave an anonymous public review on the podcast platform criticising the registrar\u2019s behaviour to pressure them to stop</b> is inappropriate. Public shaming is unprofessional, may prejudice fair investigation, and can worsen disclosure. Concerns should be handled via proper organisational routes.<br /><br /><b>Do nothing because the registrar uses a pseudonym and says details are changed</b> is inappropriate. A pseudonym does not remove professional duties. If people locally could identify a patient from the details, it\u2019s still a breach. You must act on reasonable concerns. The GMC does not explicitly ban doctors from using pseudonyms, but its guidance on using social media strongly advises against it when discussing health or healthcare matters. The overarching principle is that doctors' online conduct must maintain public trust in the profession.<br /><br /><b>Ask the student nurse who recognised the patient to check with the patient whether they noticed and obtain retrospective consent</b> is inappropriate. Consent must be informed and prospective; seeking it after publication is coercive and widens the breach. Focus on containment and formal management.<br /><br /><b>Immediately report the registrar to the GMC</b> is inappropriate. External referral may be necessary for serious/persistent issues, but GMC advises using local mechanisms first unless there\u2019s an urgent, grave, or unmanageable risk. You should escalate externally if these issues are unresolved or very serious.<br /><br /><b>Complete an incident report per policy about what you have observed online</b> is inappropriate at this stage. Documentation and incident reporting support organisational learning and any duty-of-candour processes if patients were affected. It follows immediate containment and escalation (which are the most appropriate of these options).<br /><br /><b>Share short clips with non-clinical friends to ask if they can identify the patient</b> is inappropriate. Unnecessary sharing extends the breach and violates confidentiality. Only those who need to know should be involved.",

A discreet, proportionate approach respects the colleague\u2019s dignity, may rapidly contain risk (by removing content), and models professional behaviour.<br /><br /><b>Review the specific episode(s), note time-stamps and potentially identifying details, and check local social-media/information governance policy to frame a clear concern</b> is most appropriate. Raising concerns should be honest, fair, and evidence-based. Minimal fact-checking (without circulating the content) ensures accuracy and helps you describe the risk precisely to seniors/information governance. This avoids gossip and aligns with GMC expectations around fairness and probity.<br /><br /><b>Escalate through your line manager/clinical lead or Freedom to Speak Up Guardian) and follow the organisation\u2019s information-governance policy</b> is most appropriate. Potential breaches of confidentiality and professionalism require prompt escalation so the trust can assess risk, involve information governance/legal/comms, and coordinate remedial actions. GMC guidance is clear: act without delay when patient safety or public trust may be at risk, and use formal channels.<br /><br />The remaining options are inappropriate/less appropriate:<br /><br /><b>Post a warning in the staff WhatsApp with a link to the podcast so others \u201csee the problem\u201d</b> is inappropriate. Broadcasting/resharing the content amplifies the breach and risks further disclosure. Use official channels and the principle of minimum necessary disclosure.<br /><br /><b>Leave an anonymous public review on the podcast platform criticising the registrar\u2019s behaviour to pressure them to stop</b> is inappropriate. Public shaming is unprofessional, may prejudice fair investigation, and can worsen disclosure. Concerns should be handled via proper organisational routes.<br /><br /><b>Do nothing because the registrar uses a pseudonym and says details are changed</b> is inappropriate. A pseudonym does not remove professional duties. If people locally could identify a patient from the details, it\u2019s still a breach. You must act on reasonable concerns. The GMC does not explicitly ban doctors from using pseudonyms, but its guidance on using social media strongly advises against it when discussing health or healthcare matters. The overarching principle is that doctors' online conduct must maintain public trust in the profession.<br /><br /><b>Ask the student nurse who recognised the patient to check with the patient whether they noticed and obtain retrospective consent</b> is inappropriate. Consent must be informed and prospective; seeking it after publication is coercive and widens the breach. Focus on containment and formal management.<br /><br /><b>Immediately report the registrar to the GMC</b> is inappropriate. External referral may be necessary for serious/persistent issues, but GMC advises using local mechanisms first unless there\u2019s an urgent, grave, or unmanageable risk. You should escalate externally if these issues are unresolved or very serious.<br /><br /><b>Complete an incident report per policy about what you have observed online</b> is inappropriate at this stage. Documentation and incident reporting support organisational learning and any duty-of-candour processes if patients were affected. It follows immediate containment and escalation (which are the most appropriate of these options).<br /><br /><b>Share short clips with non-clinical friends to ask if they can identify the patient</b> is inappropriate. Unnecessary sharing extends the breach and violates confidentiality. Only those who need to know should be involved.",
