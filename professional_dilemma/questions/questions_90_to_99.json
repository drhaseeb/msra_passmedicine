        "title": "GMC: Treatment and care towards the end of life - Working with the principles and decision-making models",
        "body": "There's an old aphorism in medicine sometimes attributed to Hippocrates: 'c'ure sometimes, treat often, comfort always'. This reminds us to think about goals of care. The end of life is a time when it is important to think ethically and communicate effectively about these goals.<br /><br />Recognition that a patient is entering the end of life is the first step is determining the goals of care. We are often too slow to see the signs that death is near, and too slow to think that our interventions need to change in order to reflect this. Just because a patient cannot be cured does not mean they should not be treated or comforted.<br /><br />Good palliative care at the end of life can make the difference between an agonising and emotionally traumatic death or one in comfort, quiet and relative dignity. Good clinical medicine and good ethical reasoning are needed to make sure this happens. <br /><br /><h5 class='notes-heading'>Key principles</h5><br />The GMC lists key principles which should control decision-making at the end of life. <br /><br /><i>Equalities and human rights.</i> Those at the end of life are owed the same quality of care as all patients, including with regard to dignity and confidentiality.<br /><br /><i>Presumption in favour of prolonging life.</i> Any decision about potentially life-prolonging treatment should not be motivated by a desire to bring about a patient's death. There is also a general presumption to take all reasonable steps which can prolong life, though, depending on patient's wishes and doctors' clinical judgement, it may be considered appropriate to refrain from providing or withdraw a potentially life-prolonging intervention.<br /><br /><i>Presumption of capacity.</i> The usual assumption that all adults have capacity until it has been shown they lack it applies to patients at the end of life.<br /><br /><i>Maximising capacity to make decisions.</i> Capacity should be assessed for each relevant decision, and steps should be taken to support patients in doing so.<br /><br /><i>Overall benefit.</i> If a patient lacks capacity, a decision in their overall benefit should be made.<br /><br />A decision-making model for patients with capacity<br /><ul><li>Assess the patient's condition, understanding and views</li><li>Use your experience and clinical judgment to identify investigations and treatments clinically appropriate and likely to result in overall benefit for the patient. Explain these options, laying out their potential burdens, risks and benefits</li><li>Allow the patient to accept or refuse any of these options</li></ul><br /><h5 class='notes-heading'>What if a patient with capacity requests something clinically inappropriate?</h5><br />Inquire into why the patient is making such a request, and clarify potential misunderstandings. If the patient maintains their clinically inappropriate request you are not obliged to fulfil it. You should explain why you do not think it is appropriate and allow the patient to exercise their right to a second opinion should they wish to do so.<br /><br /><h5 class='notes-heading'>A decision-making model for adults who lack capacity</h5><br />There are some additional measure to take for adults who lack capacity:<br /><ul><li>Clearly identify which clinical decisions need to be made</li><li>Check if the patient has a legally binding advance decision</li><li>Find out if the patient has a legal proxy (NB: not all proxies are permitted to make medical decisions)</li><li>Take responsibility for deciding which treatment will provide overall benefit to the patient if there is no legal proxy, making sure to consult those close to the patient when doing so</li></ul><br />When this stage is reached, the model for making a clinical decision is as follows:<br /><ul><li>Along with the patient's carer, assess the patient's condition, understanding and views</li><li>Along with evidence of the patient's views, use your experience and clinical judgement to identify investigations and treatments clinically appropriate and likely to result in overall benefit for the patient</li><li>If there is evidence of an advance decision, judge whether it is legally binding and/or applicable to the current circumstances</li><li>If it is, follow it. If it is not, include it as evidence in your assessment of a patient's wishes</li><li>If the patient has a legal proxy for clinical decisions, explain to them the different options along with their potential risks, benefits and burdens. Support the proxy's decision-making but do not pressurise it</li><li>If a proxy does not have legal power over clinical decisions their views should be considered, along with those of the rest of the healthcare team</li><li>In England and Wales, if there is no proxy or forthcoming other person to assist in the process, arrange for an Independent Mental Capacity Advocate to do so</li></ul><br /><h5 class='notes-heading'>What if there is disagreement between the proxy the medical team?</h5><br />If the patient has a proxy to make clinical decisions and there is disagreement between the proxy and the medical team about what clinical decisions should be made steps should be taken to resolve the matter informally, for example by holding a case meeting, getting a second opinion, engaging in further discussion. <br /><br />If all this fails, seek legal advice.<br /><br /><h5 class='notes-heading'>How do I make a decision in overall benefit? </h5><br />Making a decision which is in the patient's overall benefit requires you to think both about clinically and ethically. It's not just a question of asking 'will this intervention work'? You also must ask: 'is it the right thing for this patient under these circumstances?' <br /><br />What might be routine in other circumstances might be inappropriate if a patient is in extremis, for example because the intervention has an unreasonably small prospect of changing management and benefiting the patient. Fluid resuscitation might be basic protocol in other cases, but if a patient is lying on their death bed, it is unclear that they will derive a benefit from intravenous cannulation and a fluid bolus (subcutaneous fluids, however, might be appropriate). <br /><br />Some questions to ask:<br /><ul><li>What is the aim of this procedure under these circumstances?</li><li>Does this procedure benefit the patient?</li><li>Is this aim appropriate to the goals of care?</li><li>Are these goals better served by other interventions?</li></ul><br />NB: these questions are all about whether the intervention is worthwhile, not whether prolonging life of a given patient is worthwhile. The decision to refrain from intervening or withdrawing an intervention is best made on the basis of the proportionality of the intervention itself and not based on a judgement upon the value of the life it aims to sustain.<br /><br /><h5 class='notes-heading'>Putting this in to practice: DNACPR</h5><br />Decisions to not attempt cardiopulmonary resuscitation illustrate the principles laid out in this guidance. When broaching this subject with patients/proxies it is important to communicate clearly the potential risks, benefits and harms.  You need to assess the patient's clinical condition carefully as well as their own views. Then you need to lay before them the different options explaining the relevant risks etc. If you are satisfied that the patient understands this but still wishes to be resuscitated, it is important to explore this further. However, ultimately, the patient's wish cannot compel you to engage in CPR if, in your considered professional judgement, it is not appropriate. <br /><br />Note, however, that a DNACPR order is not a licence for neglect or an excuse to stop all treatment. A patient may 'be DNACPR' but intravenous antibiotics might still be appropriate for them, for example. <span class=\"concept\" data-cid=\"11076\">A DNACPR is only one clinical decision: the decisions that CPR would be inappropriate. It says nothing about other ceilings of care</span>.<br /><br /><h5 class='notes-heading'>General pointers</h5><br />Good communication'at a time of life which is fraught with emotion and stress poor communication and misunderstanding can only hinder care.<br /><br />Plan ahead'failing to think about the end of life can leave patients and medical teams unprepared. Don't be blindsided by a deteriorating patient. Keep an eye out for the signs of decline and initiate the important discussions with the patient, relatives and colleagues.<br /><br />Uncertainty'there is a lot of uncertainty around death. Help relatives deal with this by explaining what their relative is experiencing and what your plan is.<br /><br />Review decisions'sometimes, a patient's condition will change unexpectedly. Be ready to reconsider previous decisions in light of this.<br /><br />Know the law'be familiar with the laws relevant to your jurisdiction concerning capacity, advanced decisions etc. <br /><br />Think ethically'just like it is important to reason from basic principles to conclusions in clinical medicine, so it is important to reason ethically through difficult decisions.",

The doctor can discuss with the patient why they would like a chaperone and, if the patient still declines, arrange for the patient to be examined by another doctor.

At this point, the patient may agree to a chaperone being present. If not, it may be appropriate to make alternative arrangements depending on clinical urgency.

        "body": "The GMC has produced extensive guidance on how to appropriately perform intimate examinations and the role of chaperones in this. The guidance covers what constitutes an intimate examination, how a doctor should conduct such an examination and how chaperones should be involved in the process.<br /><br />Intimate examinations:<br /><ul><li>Essentially this is anything the patient would consider intimate or intrusive</li><li>This will most commonly be examinations of the rectum, genitalia and breasts</li><li>This definition can be different for any patient and you should think about whether the patient would consider what you are doing intimate</li></ul><br />Performing the examination:<br /><ul><li>As with any procedure, you should seek informed consent from the patient to carry out the examination</li><li>This involves explaining what you will do and why and how exposed they will be</li><li>You should make sure they are happy to proceed and ensure they have had all their questions answered</li><li>In addition you should explain that you will stop the examination at any point if asked to by the patient</li><li>During the examination it is good practice to only talk if it is relevant to the examination</li></ul><br />Chaperones:<br /><ul><li>A chaperone is an impartial person who is present during the examination to both offer support to the patient and act as an observer to ensure the examination is carried out in a professional manner</li><li>They should be a healthcare worker who has no relation to the patient or doctor. Patients may also wish to have family members present for support but they cannot be relied upon as chaperones as they are not impartial</li><li>The <span class=\"concept\" data-cid=\"10372\">full name and role of the chaperone should be documented in the medical records</span> with the examination findings</li><li>In the event of the patient making any allegations against the doctor with regards to the examination, the chaperone can be called on as a witness</li><li>The chaperone should also be able to safely announce whether they feel any behaviours are inappropriate during the examination</li><li>It is <span class=\"concept\" data-cid=\"10370\">not mandatory to have a chaperone and many patients may wish to be examined without another individual present. In these cases, the offer and refusal should be documented in the medical records</span></li><li>A doctor <span class=\"concept\" data-cid=\"10371\">should not feel pressured to perform an examination without a chaperone if they do not wish. However, they should ensure the patient is referred to a colleague who is comfortable doing so and that they would not wait unnecessarily</span> for treatment because of this</li></ul><br /><h5 class='notes-heading'>Examples</h5><br /><i>You are a male GP and are seeing a female Muslim patient who wears a Hijab due to a chronic cough. You need to perform a respiratory examination</i><br /><ul><li>Although you may not normally consider listening to the chest to be an intimate examination, you must be sensitive to other people's cultures and beliefs and in this case it is reasonable to assume the patient may wish for a chaperone to be present if she is to have her chest exposed for the examination</li><li>A chaperone should be offered and then if requested their full name and role documented in the medical records</li></ul><br /><i>A 63-year-old man attends his GP due to problems passing urine. His GP wishes to perform a prostate examination. The patient agrees but does not want a chaperone present</i><br /><ul><li>The offer and refusal of a chaperone should be documented in the medical records but this should not prevent the doctor performing the examination</li><li>If the doctor is comfortable to do so then they may perform the examination, if not they must refer to a colleague to do so</li></ul><br /><i>A 19-year-old female attends her GP with urethral discharge. The male GP wishes to perform a vaginal exam and take swabs but he feels she has been very inappropriately sexual with him during the consultation and she is refusing to allow a chaperone to be present for the examination</i><br /><ul><li>You should feel under no obligations to perform any procedure or examination you are not comfortable doing</li><li>The most reasonable solution here would be to ask if a colleague could perform the examination on your behalf provided they are happy to do so without a chaperone</li><li>A patient should never be forced to have a chaperone present for an examination if they do not wish although it is not unreasonable to further explain the reasons for offering a chaperone in these situations beyond simply offering one</li><li>A patient's care should not be delayed so ideally a colleague should be able to perform this examination within the immediate future or the patient should be referred on to another service which may be able to examine her</li></ul>",

GMC guidance states that 'doctors should usually abide by the wishes of an adult patient who refuses consent to information being shared, even if that leaves them, but nobody else, at risk of harm.' However, this does not apply in this scenario as it is not just the patient at risk but also her children. Regardless of the fact that the children appear relaxed and well looked after, it is clear from the brief that they have experienced abuse. Confidentiality can be waived if disclosing the information is justified in the public interest. This is the case in this scenario as children are at risk. This would also be the case if a vulnerable adult was at risk. It is, therefore, appropriate to inform relevant services. <b> Contact local child protection services</b> is thus one of the correct options. <br /><br /><b>Advise the patient you cannot keep this information confidential</b> is correct. The GMC state clearly that, when disclosing information without consent, you should explain clearly to the involved parties why the information has been shared and how the information will be used. <br /><br />The final correct option is <b>give the patient information on local domestic violence support groups</b>. The GMC state clearly that, when disclosing abuse, patients should be given access to information and support. The GMC also states that, when sharing information about abuse, the patient should be given access to groups that can provide independent advice and support. <br /><br /><b>Advise the children's school of the allegations</b> is incorrect. Although the children's school will likely be involved in subsequent proceedings, involving them now is not a priority. Instead, child protection services will need to coordinate the response to this disclosure and ensure the children's welfare. Furthermore, as the school is not the appropriate agency to initially deal with these allegations, talking to the school without the patient's consent would be breaking confidentiality. As above, you are only allowed to disclose information without consent if it is in public interest. In these cases, the information is disclosed to the relevant agency and the patient must be advised of what information has been disclosed and to who. <br /><br /><b>Advise the patient that if she does not seek support, she may lose care of her children</b> is likely to leave the patient, who is a victim in this scenario, feeling judged, guilty and afraid. As discussed above, you need to break confidentiality regardless of whether the patient chooses to seek support or not. Whilst it would be appropriate to explain why the patient needs help, including the element of risk to her children, this manner is blunt and may panic the patient and cause her to lose trust in those trying to help her. It is certainly far less appropriate than giving the patient support information, contacting relevant services and letting the patient know that you have done this. <br /><br /><b>Contact the council to arrange emergency housing for the family</b> is incorrect - it breaks confidentiality as only relevant groups (e.g. child protection services) should be informed of the allegations. It is not your place to arrange housing for the family, especially without asking what the patient needs or wants. Your job is to inform appropriate services who will then help the patient make a plan. <br /><br /><b>Encourage the patient to arrange relationship counselling</b> is incorrect. This does not deal with the risk to the patient or her children. It is not your place to make this suggestion and it is unlikely to be helpful in the context of domestic abuse. <br /><br /><b>Make the patient an appointment with a senior for the following week to discuss these concerns in greater detail and make a plan</b> is incorrect as this involves not dealing with the disclosure or the risk to the children in a timely manner and may be seen as dismissive. Whilst it is likely you would want senior support in this case, the patient and her children still need to be dealt with immediately to keep them safe. <br /><br /><b>Reassure the patient that this information will be kept confidential but make her an appointment with a senior for the following day</b> is incorrect. You need to act on the possible risk to the children immediately. Whilst the partner is meant to be away for the week, you cannot guarantee that he will not come home early and put the family at risk. It would be unacceptable to be aware of the risk to the family and not act until the following day. Whilst it would certainly be appropriate to seek senior support, this must be done immediately. Furthermore, it is not appropriate to tell the patient that the information will be kept confidential; as children are at risk, child protection services need to be aware, and the patient needs to know this. She is likely to lose her trust in you if you falsely tell her that no one else will be told of her allegations.",

        "body": "Patient confidentiality is crucial for building and maintaining trust and is therefore essential to the patient-doctor relationship. There are times, however, when it is necessary to break confidentiality, particularly where there are children involved.<br /><br />Doctors are required to inform a relevant agency (such as the police or social services) where there is concern that a child or young person is currently suffering abuse or neglect, or is at risk of suffering abuse or neglect. This concern may arise from a consultation with the child or young person themselves, or a consultation with someone close to them. <br /><br />This guidance about breaking confidentiality is different to that regarding adults. For example, if a woman presents to the surgery and makes a disclosure of domestic violence, the doctor is not required to inform local services if the patient does not wish them to. However, if there are children in the home and the patient suggests that her partner is also violent towards the children, a local agency must be informed.<br /><br />Wherever possible, consent to disclose the relevant information should be obtained from the patient. This should involve explaining the following:<br /><ul><li>what information will be shared</li><li>who it will be shared with</li><li>how the information will be used</li><li>who they can go to for independent advice and support </li></ul><br />However, <b> consent should not be sought if this may put the child at greater risk </b> and <b> disclosure of information should not be delayed whilst consent is sought. </b><br /><br />When informing an appropriate agency about concerns, the following information should be provided:<br /><ul><li>the identities of the child or young person, their parents and any other people that may pose a risk to them</li><li>the reasons for your concerns, including any relevant information about the child's health and any relevant information about the parents or carers</li></ul><br />Doctors should always follow up their concerns and escalate to the next level of authority if they believe that the concerns are not being addressed appropriately.<br /><br /><h5 class='notes-heading'> Example 1 </h5><br />A 28-year-old woman presents to her general practitioner with facial swelling and bruising. On questioning, she reveals that her partner kicked her in the face during an argument. She states that he has also been aggressive to her two young children, once threatening her 3-year-old son with a knife. However, she begs you not to inform the police or social services, as she says she has the situation under control. <br /><br /><b> Explanation: </b> In this situation, the general practitioner <u> must </u> inform social services immediately, or contact the police if they believe the children to be at risk of immediate harm. During the consultation, the GP should discuss with the patient what information they will be sharing, who they will be sharing it with and how the information will be used (ie what is likely to be the outcome of sharing this information). The doctor should also share the contact information for a local domestic abuse charity with the patient so that she can seek immediate advice and support if she wishes. <br /><br /><b> Example 2 </b> <br /><br />The scenario is the same as above, except the patient threatens to move both the children and her abusive partner to her sister's home in France if the general practitioner informs social services or the police.<br /><br /><b> Explanation: </b> In this scenario, it would be dangerous to inform the patient that you will be passing information onto the relevant agencies, as this would endanger the children. Therefore, the GP should immediately inform social services and/or the police <u> without </u> first informing the mother.",
