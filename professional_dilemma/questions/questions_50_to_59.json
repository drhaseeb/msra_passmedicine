            "This case involves an adult who discloses domestic abuse but who does not wish for the disclosure to be taken further. In <i>Good Medical Practice</i> (2013), the GMC reiterates that all patients have the right to a confidential medical service. However, there are circumstances where disclosing information is justified in the public interest. In the case of domestic violence, for example, this information would need to be shared if there were children or a vulnerable adult at risk. However, this is not the case in this scenario. The adult patient has capacity and there are no other adults or children at risk. GMC guidance states that 'doctors should usually abide by the wishes of an adult patient who refuses consent to information being shared, even if that leaves them, but nobody else, at risk of harm'. The guidance also states, however, that doctors should give patients appropriate information and support them to get help. The most appropriate answer is, therefore, <b> give the patient information on local domestic violence support groups and arrange a follow-up</b>. Arranging a follow-up will allow you to provide further support and information to the patient if required. <br /><br />The next most appropriate answer is <b>advise the patient to make another appointment if they wish to discuss things further</b>. This is not the best option as you have not given the patient information and support, as the GMC stipulates. The patient may not make a further appointment and therefore may not be given the resources they need. They may feel dismissed by this option. However, this option is better than the remaining options which all involve breaking confidentiality.<br /><br />The next three options are all inappropriate as they involve breaking confidentiality. Of the three, <b>contact the police</b> is the least inappropriate as this would be the correct agency to contact if the patient did give you permission to take this further. It is a legal matter, rather than a matter for social services, as no children or vulnerable adults are involved.<br /><br /><b>Contact social services</b> is incorrect both as this option involves breaking patient confidentiality and contacting the wrong services - there are no children or vulnerable adults involved in this scenario.<br /><br /><b>Contact the partner to arrange a mediation session with the partner and patient</b>  is the worst option. You are likely not qualified to lead a mediation session between the couple. More significantly, this option would involve both breaking patient confidentiality and it would potentially put your patient at risk, as their partner is now aware that they have disclosed the abuse. Whilst contacting the police or social services is breaking confidentiality, these options do not involve putting the patient at risk from their partner.",

However, this option is better than the remaining options which all involve breaking confidentiality.<br /><br />The next three options are all inappropriate as they involve breaking confidentiality. Of the three, <b>contact the police</b> is the least inappropriate as this would be the correct agency to contact if the patient did give you permission to take this further. It is a legal matter, rather than a matter for social services, as no children or vulnerable adults are involved.<br /><br /><b>Contact social services</b> is incorrect both as this option involves breaking patient confidentiality and contacting the wrong services - there are no children or vulnerable adults involved in this scenario.<br /><br /><b>Contact the partner to arrange a mediation session with the partner and patient</b>  is the worst option. You are likely not qualified to lead a mediation session between the couple. More significantly, this option would involve both breaking patient confidentiality and it would potentially put your patient at risk, as their partner is now aware that they have disclosed the abuse. Whilst contacting the police or social services is breaking confidentiality, these options do not involve putting the patient at risk from their partner.",

        "body": "This guidance covers disclosing information in adults; there is separate GMC guidance for children. <br /><br />The GMC highlight the importance of a confidential medical service. However, sometimes patients are unable to protect themselves, and we may need to disclose personal information to protect their health and welfare. <br /><br /><h5 class='notes-heading'>I'm worried that my patient is at risk of harm abuse or neglect- Should I disclose?</h5><br />1) Empower patients- make decisions about how to best move forward in partnership <br /><br />2) If disclosure is required by law- You must disclose, but only the specific requested information, in the manner required by law. Inform your patient of disclosure (unless It would undermine the purpose)<br /><br />3) Some disclosures are permitted but not required by law- these should have a legal basis <br /><br />4) How you act will partly depend on whether this patient has capacity or lacks capacity:<br /><br /><div class=\"table-responsive\"><table class = \"tlarge table table-striped table-bordered\"  data-role=\"table\" id=\"tableid1\" ><thead><tr><th></th><th>Disclosure required by law</th><th>Disclosure not required by law</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td><b>Has capacity</b></td><td>You must disclose</td><td>Requires patient consent (if practicable)- ultimately the patient's decision unless non-disclosure puts others at risk of serious harm/death. If they refuse, find out why, inform them of the risks and refer to support groups</td></tr><tr><td><b>Lacks capacity</b></td><td>You must disclose</td><td>You must disclose to appropriate authority/person (unless not of overall benefit to the patient). Discuss with an experienced colleague and document if you think it's not in the patient's best interest</td></tr></tbody></table></div><br /><h5 class='notes-heading'>Can I share information to protect others/the public?</h5><br />Confidentiality is in the public interest as it benefits society and individuals to seek medical care. However, this must be balanced with protecting and promoting the health of patients and the public. <br /><br /><div class=\"table-responsive\"><table class = \"tlarge table table-striped table-bordered\"  data-role=\"table\" id=\"tableid2\" ><thead><tr><th>Required by law</th><th>Requests for information</th><th>Disclosure not required by law</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>You must disclose e.g. infectious disease notification, provision of social and health care, preventing terrorism and investigation of road traffic accidents.</td><td>Take these seriously if patients pose a risk of serious harm (e.g. violent or sex offenders), and for formal inquiries, inquests and reviews</td><td>Either patient must consent (unless not practicable) or must have a legal basis</td></tr></tbody></table></div>If you have already decided to disclose the information, don't request consent, instead inform them of this intention, unless not safe or practicable.<br /><br /><br /><h5 class='notes-heading'>Deciding if you will disclose regardless of if the patient consents:</h5><br />1. Would non-disclosure put others at risk of death or serious harm? - this may justify disclosure e.g. <br /><ul><li>When a victim of violence doesn't want to inform the police, but the perpetrator still poses a significant risk to others, such as children in domestic violence.</li><li>If someone keeps driving despite being told they are not fit to drive</li><li>A patient has a serious communicable disease but refuses to disclose</li><li>A patient is working despite being unfit for work and this poses a serious risk to others</li></ul><br />2. You should only disclose if you decide that the risk of not disclosing is so serious that it outweighs the patient and public interest in maintaining confidentiality. <br /><br /><div class=\"table-responsive\"><table class = \"tlarge table table-striped table-bordered\"  data-role=\"table\" id=\"tableid3\" ><thead><tr><th>Pro-confidentiality factors</th><th>Pro-disclosure factors</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Harm/distress from disclosing may cause withdrawal from care and poor health</td><td>Harm to others if not disclosed</td></tr><tr><td>Disclosing will reduce overall trust in perception of doctors</td><td>Benefit to others if information disclosed</td></tr></tbody></table></div><br />Think about the nature of the information and what the patient thinks. Can you minimise the breach of the patient's privacy and still avoid harm?<br /><br />Genetic medicine introduces another hurdle in relation to confidentiality, because if your patient Is found to have a genetic condition, this might also suggest a probability of this condition in a relative. Many patients share these results with relatives especially if they know it can help to prevent health problems in their relatives. However, if a patient refuses, it would be just to disclose if non-disclosure would risk death or serious harm in others. Try to not disclose patient identity when advising the others of the risks identified to them.<br /><br />Always document in patient records when disclosing information. Document steps you've taken to seek consent from or inform the patient about the disclosure, or reasons for not doing so. <br /><br />Whether you can disclose without consent can be complex. Before doing so, seek advice from a Caldicott or data guardian who isn't connected to the reason for the disclosure. Keep the patient details anonymous if possible.",
