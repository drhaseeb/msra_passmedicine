        "body": "Communication, partnership and teamwork form one of the four domains listed in the Good Medical Practice. This domain focuses on the standards expected of doctors in areas such as communication and collaboration with patients and colleagues.<br /><br />Effective communication<br /><ul><li>Listen to patients and answer any questions honestly</li><li>Ensure that information is delivered in a manner that can be understood. Identify and apply practical measures to overcome any communication and language barriers</li><li>Provide support and information to patients' relatives or carers in a considerate manner</li><li>Doctors on duty need to be easily reachable by their patients and colleagues for any advice or support </li></ul><br />Partnership with patients<br /><ul><li>Empower patients with the information required for patients to make decisions with regards to their care. This includes information on the clinical conditions, treatment options and the relevant risks and uncertainties</li><li>Ensure that patients are aware of the progress of their care</li><li>The roles and responsibilities of each member of the team need to be made clear to the patients</li><li>Patient confidentiality needs to be maintained, even after the patient is deceased </li></ul><br />Fair and respectful care of all patients<br /><ul><li>Respect patients' dignity and privacy </li><li>Respect any health, cultural and religious beliefs held by the patients, even if they do not agree with yours. </li></ul><br />If you have a conscientious objection to a particular procedure e.g. abortion, you need to:<br /><ul><li>Inform the patient that they have the right to see another practitioner</li><li>Provide the necessary information and support towards the patient seeking another doctor. In doing so, refrain from expressing disapproval of the patient's lifestyle, choices or beliefs</li><li>Find another doctor to substitute you if it is not practical for the patient to arrange to see another doctor</li></ul><br />Partnership with colleagues<br /><ul><li>Doctors are expected to work in a team in a manner that serves patients' best interest</li><li>It is important to respect the skills and contributions of every member of the team and be fair to every member of the team </li><li>Understand that your actions may affect others within and outside the team </li><li>It is your duty to complete any post that you have formally accepted as leaving the post assigned to you may compromise patient safety especially if this creates a gap in the medical rota</li><li>Unless the trust has a reasonable time to make adjustments, it is important that you work the hours required of your contract before leaving a job</li></ul><br />Coordination of care between healthcare providers and between health and social care providers. This include <br /><ul><li>Providing all relevant information to all clinicians or social care providers involved in the care of the patients  </li><li>Checking that a named doctor or team has taken over the care </li><li>Ensure that the clinician filling in for you or taking over the care is appropriately trained to provide safe care for the patient </li></ul><br />The Good Medical Practice also made statements with regards to Doctors as teachers. It recommends that doctors support the training and teaching of junior staff members and medical students*. This includes<br /><ul><li>Ensuring adequate supervision</li><li>Writing honest feedback/references/appraisals on their competence, performance and conduct</li><li>Being a mentor</li><li>Supporting those who are struggling with their performance or health</li></ul><br />*In all circumstances, patient safety needs to be prioritised",

            "<b>Focus on finishing the consultation before revisiting the possibility of photographing the lesion</b>. Firstly, it is important to finish the consultation before moving on to the possibility of photography. The visual bank you are creating is a personal project, but the home visit consultation is your duty as a healthcare professional. It can be addressed as an aside once his presenting complaint has been managed.<br /><br /><b>Enquire whether community clinical photography would be available for photography</b>. It may be possible for clinical photography to get involved as there is a role for community-based clinical photography because of cases like this where the patient has poor mobility. As this is a personal project, they may well refuse. It is worth asking, however, as this sign is rare and it would be educationally valuable. <br /><br /><b>Ensure any photographs obscure or avoid his tattoo</b>. Tattoos are identifiable features of a person, and so it is good practice to obscure them if possible (as is commonly done with eyes). As this sign is next to his tattoo, this won't affect the educational value of the photograph. This helps to maintain the anonymity of the patient.<br /><br /><b>Ask the patient to attend in-house clinical photography</b>. It is inappropriate to ask the patient to attend clinical photography as he has very poor mobility and may feel pressured to attend despite facing difficulty doing so. Making a reasonable adjustment for the patient's condition would be a more professional and kinder alternative.<br /><br /><b>Make sure a copy of the photograph is inputted into his GP records</b>. While his abdominal pain may be related to his poorly controlled coeliac disease, it is unnecessary to have a copy in the GP notes unless they are being sent to a specialist for review due to uncertainty of origin. Sometimes this may be appropriate (for example, suspicious bruises in suspected child abuse), but this is not such a time. Furthermore, it can much more easily be described.<br /><br /><b>Perform a full capacity assessment on the patient before deciding on taking photographs.</b> It is inappropriate to perform a capacity assessment as there is no indication he lacks capacity. For example, there is no history of dementia or delirium, common cases where capacity may need to be assessed.<br /><br /><b>Post the photo as an anonymised submission in your educational resource page from your phone</b>. It is inappropriate to take photos from your phone and clinical photography should be contacted to take these photos as they may not be stored with adequate security or disposed of correctly.<br /><br /><b>Take a photograph on your phone and ensure it is deleted fully as soon as the photo is uploaded</b>. It is inappropriate to take photographs yourself. These photographs can easily be forgotten and not deleted. Furthermore, it is wrong to post them yourself from your phone; often, the location is embedded and uploaded with the photograph on social media. It is important to be aware of this, as it could compromise the confidentiality of the patient by giving away his address.<br /><br /><b>Tell him there is no way the photographs can be taken securely</b>. While this is an option, it would be a shame not to input a photo of a rare sign in your project unless clinical photography or the patient objects. As community clinical photography is an option, this is technically not true and it is an option if they consent (which needs to be checked).",

As this sign is next to his tattoo, this won't affect the educational value of the photograph. This helps to maintain the anonymity of the patient.<br /><br /><b>Ask the patient to attend in-house clinical photography</b>. It is inappropriate to ask the patient to attend clinical photography as he has very poor mobility and may feel pressured to attend despite facing difficulty doing so. Making a reasonable adjustment for the patient's condition would be a more professional and kinder alternative.<br /><br /><b>Make sure a copy of the photograph is inputted into his GP records</b>. While his abdominal pain may be related to his poorly controlled coeliac disease, it is unnecessary to have a copy in the GP notes unless they are being sent to a specialist for review due to uncertainty of origin. Sometimes this may be appropriate (for example, suspicious bruises in suspected child abuse), but this is not such a time. Furthermore, it can much more easily be described.<br /><br /><b>Perform a full capacity assessment on the patient before deciding on taking photographs.</b> It is inappropriate to perform a capacity assessment as there is no indication he lacks capacity. For example, there is no history of dementia or delirium, common cases where capacity may need to be assessed.<br /><br /><b>Post the photo as an anonymised submission in your educational resource page from your phone</b>. It is inappropriate to take photos from your phone and clinical photography should be contacted to take these photos as they may not be stored with adequate security or disposed of correctly.<br /><br /><b>Take a photograph on your phone and ensure it is deleted fully as soon as the photo is uploaded</b>. It is inappropriate to take photographs yourself. These photographs can easily be forgotten and not deleted. Furthermore, it is wrong to post them yourself from your phone; often, the location is embedded and uploaded with the photograph on social media. It is important to be aware of this, as it could compromise the confidentiality of the patient by giving away his address.<br /><br /><b>Tell him there is no way the photographs can be taken securely</b>. While this is an option, it would be a shame not to input a photo of a rare sign in your project unless clinical photography or the patient objects. As community clinical photography is an option, this is technically not true and it is an option if they consent (which needs to be checked).",

        "body": "The guidance published by the GMC on social media usage is broad in its scope: the emphasis is on upholding the <b>same professional standards </b>as we do with our face-to-face interactions and those on traditional media.  These notes are not intended to act as a substitute the full guidance, but rather to provide an accessible summary of salient points for revision purposes.<br /><br />The GMC definition of 'social media' makes reference to blogs (including Twitter), internet forums, content communities (such as Youtube and Instagram) and social networking sites (such as Facebook and LinkedIn).  In case studies published on the GMC website, the scope is also widened to include group messaging services (such as WhatsApp).<br /><br />When using social media, it is important to remember the following:<br /><ul><li>Social media sites cannot guarantee privacy <b>regardless of what privacy settings are in place </b></li><li>As such, it should be assumed that patients, employers (current and prospective), professional regulators <b>can see your personal information</b></li><li>Once information has been published online it can be difficult or impossible to <b>erase completely</b></li><li>Information about your <b>location</b> may also be embedded within photographs and may be shared without your knowledge</li><li>Content posted <b>anonymously can be traced</b> back to its point of origin in many cases</li></ul><br />Practical recommendations included within the guidance:<br /><ul><li>Maintain privacy: regularly review privacy settings, ensure all content published is only accessible to the intended audience.</li><li>Maintain boundaries: do not communicate with patients via personal profiles such as Facebook. Instead redirect them to the relevant professional channels if appropriate.</li><li>Maintain confidentiality: never share identifiable patient information online, even in forums accessible by 'professionals' only.  Remember: the sum of information available online may enable identification, even if the individual was not identifiable from your post or entry in isolation.</li><li>Maintain respect for colleagues: treat colleagues fairly and with respect (<i> Good Medical Practice</i>). Never bully, harass or make unfounded claims.  Defamation and copyright law still applies when referring to an individual organisation online even when using a personal profile.</li><li>Maintain trust in the profession: if you identify yourself as a doctor, you must also identify by your name, and ensure any content published in this capacity is factual and can be cross-checked.  Be open about conflicts of interest.</li></ul>",
