        "body": "Actions that may be considered to be sexual behaviours:<br /><ul><li>Physical contact that is neither appropriate nor necessary for the care of a patient </li><li>Unprofessional and inappropriate sexual remarks </li></ul><br />The Good Medical Practice has stated that doctors should not make any sexual advances or engage in a non-professional loving relationship with a patient or anyone close to them. Failure to abide by this may jeopardise patient care and the public trust in doctors. This may also lead to deregistration.<br /><br />If you find that your colleague has engaged in a verbal or non-verbal sexual behaviour with a patient, you have a duty to report this because patient safety or care may be compromised. This should be done according to the GMC guidance on raising concerns as such:<br /><ul><li>Follow the trust policy if available </li><li>Ask advice from a senior e.g. direct supervisor, consultant, clinical director, GP partner</li><li>If you work in a general practice, seek advice from the GP partner. However, if the incident involves the partner, raise your concern outside the practice e.g. clinical governance lead.</li><li>Contact the General Medical Council to investigate if you feel that the response to the incident has been inadequate</li></ul><br />When reporting this matter, only disclose pertinent details. Patient identity should be concealed unless patient safety becomes an issue (i.e. patient safety trumps patient confidentiality</td><td>. Prior to breaking confidentiality, patient's consent should be obtained. If the patient declines to consent, the disclosure is only appropriate if it is in the public interest. <br /><br />In the case of a sexual assault or a criminal activity such as rape or engaging in sexual intercourse with an underage patient, the police should be involved. In cases involving children, safeguarding team should be involved.",

The consent should be informed and given freely, and patients should understand the potential consequences of sharing their information.</li><li>Anonymization: When using patient information for purposes such as teaching, research, or quality improvement, doctors should anonymize the data whenever possible to protect patients' identities.</li><li>Disclosures in the public interest: In exceptional circumstances, doctors may disclose patient information without consent if it is in the public interest, such as to prevent serious harm to others or in response to communicable diseases that pose a risk to public health.</li><li>Legal requirements: Doctors must comply with legal requirements to disclose patient information, such as court orders or statutory reporting obligations.</li><li>Confidentiality after death: Doctors should continue to respect patients' confidentiality even after their death, unless there are compelling reasons to disclose information.</li><li>Sharing information with the healthcare team: Doctors may share patient information within the healthcare team on a need-to-know basis to provide safe and effective care.</li><li>Record-keeping: Doctors should maintain accurate, up-to-date, and secure records to protect patient information and ensure its confidentiality.</li><li>Communicating with patients: Doctors should communicate openly and honestly with patients about their right to confidentiality and how their information may be used.</li><li>Working with third parties: When working with third parties, such as insurers or employers, doctors should ensure that they have appropriate consent from patients before sharing their information.</li></ul>",

        "body": "The GMC guidelines contain information on ending your professional relationship with a patient. They state that;<br /><br />You must only end a professional relationship with a patient when the breakdown of trust means you cannot provide good clinical care. This includes the patient being violent, threatening you or being abusive or the patient having stolen from you or the premises. It also includes the patient persistently acted inconsiderately or unreasonably or if they have made a sexual advance to you. <br /><br />You should not end a relationship due to a complaint or due to resource implications.<br /><br />Before you end the relationship you must warn the patient you are considering ending it and do what you can to restore the relationship. If this fails you must explore alternatives to ending it and discuss the situation with an experienced colleague or your employer.<br /><br />When you end a relationship you must be satisfied that your reason is fair and does not discriminate. Then make sure the patient is told this is happening, and why. If practical do this in writing.",

        "title": "Mental Capacity Act",
        "body": "The Mental Capacity Act of 2005 came into force in 2007. It applies to adults over the age of 16 and sets out who can take decisions if a patient becomes incapacitated (e.g. following a stroke). Mental capacity includes the ability to make decisions affecting daily life, healthcare and financial issues. <br /><br />The Act contains 5 key principles:<br /><ul><li>A person must be assumed to have capacity unless it is established that he lacks capacity</li><li>A person is not to be treated as unable to make a decision unless all practicable steps to help him to do so have been taken without success</li><li>A person is not to be treated as unable to make a decision merely because he makes an unwise decision</li><li>An act done, or decision made, under this Act for or on behalf of a person who lacks capacity must be done, or made, in his best interests</li><li>Before the act is done, or the decision is made, regard must be had to whether the purpose for which it is needed can be as effectively achieved in a way that is less restrictive of the person's rights and freedom of action</li></ul><br /><h5 class='notes-heading'>Assessment of capacity</h5><br />The Act sets out a clear test for assessing whether a person lacks capacity. It is a 'decision-specific' and 'time-specific' test. An adult can only be considered unable to make a particular decision if:<br /><br />1. He or she has an 'impairment of, or disturbance in, the functioning of the mind or<br />brain' whether permanent or temporary AND<br /><br />2. He or she is unable to undertake any of the following<br /><ul><li>a. understand the information relevant to the decision</li><li>b. retain that information</li><li>c. use or weigh that information as part of the process of making the decision</li><li>d. communicate the decision made by talking, sign language or other means</li></ul><br />No individual can be labelled 'incapable' simply as a result of a particular medical condition. Section 2 of the Act makes it clear that a lack of capacity cannot be assumed by a person's age, appearance, or any condition or aspect of a person's behaviour<br /><br /><h5 class='notes-heading'>Best interests</h5><br />The following should be considered when assessing what is in someone's best interests:<br /><ul><li>1. Whether the person is likely to regain capacity and can the decision wait.</li><li>2. How to encourage and optimise the participation of the person in the decision.</li><li>3. The past and present wishes, feelings, beliefs, values of the person and any other relevant factors</li><li>4. Views of other relevant people</li></ul><br /><h5 class='notes-heading'>Lasting Powers of Attorney (LPAs)</h5><br />The Act allows a person to appoint an attorney to act on their behalf if they should lose capacity in the future, replacing the current Enduring Power of Attorney (EPA). In addition to property and financial affairs the Act also allows people to empower an attorney make health and welfare decisions. The attorney only has the authority to make decisions about life-sustaining treatment if the LPA specifies that. Before it can be used an LPA must be registered with the Office of the Public Guardian<br /><br /><h5 class='notes-heading'>Advance decisions</h5><br />Advance decisions can be drawn up by anybody with capacity to specify treatments they would not want if they lost capacity. They may be made verbally unless they specify refusing life-sustaining treatment (e.g. Ventilation) in which case they need to be written, signed and witnessed to be valid. Advance decisions cannot demand treatment",
