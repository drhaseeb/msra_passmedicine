        "title": "GMC: Leadership and management for all doctors - Working with colleagues",
        "body": "As with all aspects of medicine, the fundamental principle remains the same; make the patient your first concern. The purpose of this guidance is to allow the effective functioning of the clinical team to allow patient care to be done safely and smoothly, to the highest standards.<br /><br /><h5 class='notes-heading'>Leadership</h5><br />The recommendations on leadership emphasise the importance of working within a multidisciplinary team. They specifically mention that other team members in leadership positions must be respected. This respect for non-medical staff in leadership roles is important.<br /><br />For example, respecting the advice and leadership of an infection control nurse with regard to hand hygiene is important in making patients are protected from iatrogenic pathogen spread.<br /><br /><h5 class='notes-heading'>Respect for colleagues</h5><br />If a colleague feels like they are not respected and not valued they may not feel able to speak up if they have concerns which may be relevant to patient safety. This is particularly important for junior and non-medical staff, and so it especially important to respect and value their skills and contribution to the team.<br /><br />Additionally there is both a legal and moral responsibility to ensure that your colleagues have a safe and fair workplace. All doctors are responsible for facilitating this not only to avoid unpleasant behaviour themselves, but also by challenging others who act in a bullying or discriminatory manner. This is important both to comply with laws and policies on equality and diversity, but also to ensure patient safety as bullying and harassment will impair team cohesion and communication.<br /><br /><br /><h5 class='notes-heading'>Communication within and between teams</h5><br />The key message from this part of the guidance is that it is important that it is clear who is responsible for communicating what information both within members of the team, to other teams, and also to patients and carers. Mistakes are often made when team members assume that someone else will have passed on the relevant information and no one ends up doing it. Therefore whenever there is any doubt about whose job it is to pass on certain information, it is obligatory to check.<br /><br />For example, if you expect that the nursing staff would have told you about any allergies the patient has, before prescribing it would be important to confirm with them that they have handed over all the relevant information.<br /><br />Also it is important that teams cooperate more generally, including by having handovers. Proactive steps must be taken to clarify responsibilities and improve communication.<br /><br /><h5 class='notes-heading'>Responsibility and accountability</h5><br />The most important duty of a doctor is to the dignity, safety and care of their patients. Again, it is important for doctors to ensure that it is clear exactly which staff members have which responsibilities, to ensure that these do not 'fall between the cracks' and get missed.<br /><br />It is also important that you make these responsibilities clear to any staff in a team that you are leading.<br /><br />When mistakes happen, it's often the result of system problems. For example it could be under-staffing putting decision making under higher strain, causing more mistakes. This happened in the Bawa-Garba case, the tragic death of a child from unrecognised sepsis on a day where a single doctor was trying to cover multiple wards.<br /><br />Consequently, it is also the responsibility of doctors to engage in setting up and maintaining systems to make sure that risks are appropriately assessed and managed. Doctors are just as accountable for advice they give as a member of a decision making body, as they are for any other medical advice they offer.",

        "title": "GMC: Confidentiality - Using and disclosing patient information for direct care",
        "body": "Sharing patient information is vital for safe and effective care. This is particularly vital when working within multi-disciplinary teams, given that all members must have access to the information that they require for their role. Part of our duty as medical professionals is to ensure that information is only shared in a way that is both legal and ethical, whilst facilitating access to those who require it. <br /><br />The consequences of inappropriate sharing of information can be significant, for both the clinician/ patient relationship and the wider profession. There have been many media examples of inappropriate information sharing, and being aware of the relevant guidelines is crucial for avoiding this.<br /><br />General principles:<br /><ul><li>Most patients expect that some information will be shared with those who are directly involved in their care. Unless the patient specifically objects, this is considered implied consent.</li><li>If a patient objects to particular personal information being shared, you should not disclose the information. The exceptions are: if it is justified for the public interest (as detailed below) or the patient lacks capacity.</li><li>You should explain to the patient the potential consequences of not allowing personal information to be shared and reach a compromise where possible.</li><li>In cases where a patient cannot be informed about information sharing, such as an emergency setting, you should pass relevant information to those providing the patient's care.</li></ul><br />Naturally, on entry to the hospital, patients may be unable to explicitly state their consent for information sharing. It is therefore easy to forget that they may wish to withhold some details. Wherever possible, it is good practice to discuss with the patient any concerns which they may have. In many cases, these concerns can be rectified without a need to breach confidentiality. This is the ideal scenario, as it helps to maintain transparency between the doctor and patient.<br /><br />Conditions for sharing information:<br /><ul><li>You must be accessing the information to support the patient's direct care, or be satisfied that it is being shared for that purpose.</li><li>Patients should be kept informed regarding how their personal information will be used. It should be clear that they have the right to object.</li><li>You must have no reason to believe the patient has objected to the information being shared.</li><li>You must be satisfied that anyone you disclose the information to understands that you are giving it to them in confidence.</li></ul><br />On a busy ward, there may be times where you are asked to share information about a patient. It is important to always check how this information will be used and to ensure that you are satisfied that it is for the patient's care- for example, sharing information with another department or speciality. Failure to do so could lead to this information falling into the wrong hands. The patient should also be given the opportunity to object to this information being passed further. <br /><br />Sharing information with friends or relatives:<br /><ul><li>Establish the patient's wishes as early as possible regarding whether they wish to have friends or relatives informed about their care.</li><li>Do not assume that a patient agrees to the disclosure simply because they have a close relationship with the person who is seeking information. You should gain explicit consent.</li><li>When a patient lacks capacity, it may be necessary to share some relevant information with friends/ relatives. This does not entitle the person to full access to the patient's clinical records, but can be used to help assess the patient's best interests. </li></ul><br />We often assume that a patient will want their family to be involved in their care, and this is often an important feature of palliative and elderly care. Despite this, the patient should still be given their own autonomy over the decision. There may even be exceptions where sharing personal information could put the patient in emotional or physical danger e.g. cases of abuse. Every patient and family is different, and part of the clinician's role is to respect and facilitate this.<br /><br />If someone close to the patient wants to discuss their concerns about the patient's health/ wellbeing without involving the patient, you should still listen. The information they give you may be helpful in caring for the patient- particularly in cases of mental ill-health. This does not mean that you are obligated to act on the information received, but it may assist in building a clinical picture.<br /><br />Considerations if a patient lacks capacity:<br /><ul><li>Consider if all possible attempts have been made to explain the disclosure to the patient, using methods and language which they can understand.</li><li>Consider whether the lack of capacity is temporary or permanent and whether the decision can wait until the patient regains capacity.</li><li>Consider if the patient has already stated their wishes regarding information being disclosed, in addition to their apparent beliefs and values.</li><li>Consider if the patient has nominated a person to make health or welfare decisions on their behalf.</li><li>If a patient asks you not to disclose personal information and you believe they lack the capacity to make this decision, you should try to persuade them to allow an appropriate person to be given relevant information. In some cases, disclosure will be required or necessary e.g. under mental health and mental capacity laws. </li></ul><br />When dealing with patients who lack capacity, reflect back to the specific GMC guidance on mental capacity. The main features involve providing the patient with maximal opportunity to state their interests, before making decisions on their behalf. In these cases, also consider if the patient has an appointed person to make decisions on their behalf.<br /><br /><h5 class='notes-heading'>Disclosures by Law</h5><br />You must not disclose information to a third party without the patient's express consent- unless it is required by law or can be justified in the public interest. It is rare that a disclosure will be required by law, but some examples of these exceptions are detailed below:<br /><ul><li>Following an order made by a judge or presiding officer of a court.</li><li>In certain cases of <span class=\"concept\" data-cid=\"10939\">communicable disease</span>, when you must inform the local authority.</li><li>To prevent an act of <span class=\"concept\" data-cid=\"10940\">terrorism</span>.</li><li>To <span class=\"concept\" data-cid=\"10941\">comply with a statutory request made by a regulatory body such as the GMC</span>. </li></ul><br />There are exceptional circumstances where information sharing is not so straight-forward, and one of these relates to gunshot wounds and knife injuries:<br /><ul><li>Gunshot wounds and those caused by a blade/ sharp instrument represent a special category of injury. </li><li>The police should usually be informed whenever a person presents with a gunshot wound, given the potential risk to others. </li><li>They should also be informed of most knife injuries- unless the injury appears to be accidental or a result of self-harm. </li><li>Personal information (such as the patient's name and address) should not be disclosed in the initial contact with the police, and the police will respond even if the patient's identity is not disclosed.</li></ul>",

            "This question is about prioritising tasks. One of the most important things a doctor can do while on-call is to look after themselves. You are no good to patients if you are tired and hungry. By grabbing lunch quickly you will feel better and thus be better prepared to work. Clearly, clerking the patients is more immediately important than going to rewrite a drug chart, however it is still a task which will need doing. In general, nursing staff should understand that you have many people asking things of you during an on-call shift and a simple apology and estimate of a time you will be free to do it is sufficient to keep them happy. Finally, by finding out a bit about your patient before seeing them will enable you to better prioritise how quickly they will need seeing. <br /><br />By clerking the patient before anything else, you risk delaying your already late lunch break by a lot longer. If you have found out that they are an emergency then you may have no choice but to see them before lunch, but many admissions can wait for 15 minutes. Although it may be tempting to go and do smaller tasks first to get them over with, it delays more important tasks which does not show good prioritisation skills. You should never ask people not to bleep you, because a bleep is also used to let a doctor know about a deteriorating patient which is obviously important.

        "question": "You are a junior doctor working an on-call shift. You are very busy and have just been asked to clerk a new admission and have not yet had a lunch break. You could be tied up with him for a while once he arrives and it has now passed 3pm. The nurses on the ward are bleeping you to come and rewrite a drug chart and write a discharge letter. You know that both of these tasks could wait until later when you are less busy, however the nursing staff are being very persistent. What do you do?<br /><br /><i>Select the THREE most appropriate actions to take in this situation</i>",
        "correct_answer": "FGH",
        "question_notes": "This question is about prioritising tasks. One of the most important things a doctor can do while on-call is to look after themselves. You are no good to patients if you are tired and hungry. By grabbing lunch quickly you will feel better and thus be better prepared to work. Clearly, clerking the patients is more immediately important than going to rewrite a drug chart, however it is still a task which will need doing. In general, nursing staff should understand that you have many people asking things of you during an on-call shift and a simple apology and estimate of a time you will be free to do it is sufficient to keep them happy. Finally, by finding out a bit about your patient before seeing them will enable you to better prioritise how quickly they will need seeing. <br /><br />By clerking the patient before anything else, you risk delaying your already late lunch break by a lot longer. If you have found out that they are an emergency then you may have no choice but to see them before lunch, but many admissions can wait for 15 minutes. Although it may be tempting to go and do smaller tasks first to get them over with, it delays more important tasks which does not show good prioritisation skills.

        "body": "Communication, partnership and teamwork form one of the four domains listed in the Good Medical Practice. This domain focuses on the standards expected of doctors in areas such as communication and collaboration with patients and colleagues.<br /><br />Effective communication<br /><ul><li>Listen to patients and answer any questions honestly</li><li>Ensure that information is delivered in a manner that can be understood. Identify and apply practical measures to overcome any communication and language barriers</li><li>Provide support and information to patients' relatives or carers in a considerate manner</li><li>Doctors on duty need to be easily reachable by their patients and colleagues for any advice or support </li></ul><br />Partnership with patients<br /><ul><li>Empower patients with the information required for patients to make decisions with regards to their care. This includes information on the clinical conditions, treatment options and the relevant risks and uncertainties</li><li>Ensure that patients are aware of the progress of their care</li><li>The roles and responsibilities of each member of the team need to be made clear to the patients</li><li>Patient confidentiality needs to be maintained, even after the patient is deceased </li></ul><br />Fair and respectful care of all patients<br /><ul><li>Respect patients' dignity and privacy </li><li>Respect any health, cultural and religious beliefs held by the patients, even if they do not agree with yours. </li></ul><br />If you have a conscientious objection to a particular procedure e.g. abortion, you need to:<br /><ul><li>Inform the patient that they have the right to see another practitioner</li><li>Provide the necessary information and support towards the patient seeking another doctor. In doing so, refrain from expressing disapproval of the patient's lifestyle, choices or beliefs</li><li>Find another doctor to substitute you if it is not practical for the patient to arrange to see another doctor</li></ul><br />Partnership with colleagues<br /><ul><li>Doctors are expected to work in a team in a manner that serves patients' best interest</li><li>It is important to respect the skills and contributions of every member of the team and be fair to every member of the team </li><li>Understand that your actions may affect others within and outside the team </li><li>It is your duty to complete any post that you have formally accepted as leaving the post assigned to you may compromise patient safety especially if this creates a gap in the medical rota</li><li>Unless the trust has a reasonable time to make adjustments, it is important that you work the hours required of your contract before leaving a job</li></ul><br />Coordination of care between healthcare providers and between health and social care providers. This include <br /><ul><li>Providing all relevant information to all clinicians or social care providers involved in the care of the patients  </li><li>Checking that a named doctor or team has taken over the care </li><li>Ensure that the clinician filling in for you or taking over the care is appropriately trained to provide safe care for the patient </li></ul><br />The Good Medical Practice also made statements with regards to Doctors as teachers. It recommends that doctors support the training and teaching of junior staff members and medical students*. This includes<br /><ul><li>Ensuring adequate supervision</li><li>Writing honest feedback/references/appraisals on their competence, performance and conduct</li><li>Being a mentor</li><li>Supporting those who are struggling with their performance or health</li></ul><br />*In all circumstances, patient safety needs to be prioritised",
