        "body": "As with all aspects of medicine, the fundamental principle remains the same; make the patient your first concern. The purpose of this guidance is to allow the effective functioning of the clinical team to allow patient care to be done safely and smoothly, to the highest standards.<br /><br /><h5 class='notes-heading'>Leadership</h5><br />The recommendations on leadership emphasise the importance of working within a multidisciplinary team. They specifically mention that other team members in leadership positions must be respected. This respect for non-medical staff in leadership roles is important.<br /><br />For example, respecting the advice and leadership of an infection control nurse with regard to hand hygiene is important in making patients are protected from iatrogenic pathogen spread.<br /><br /><h5 class='notes-heading'>Respect for colleagues</h5><br />If a colleague feels like they are not respected and not valued they may not feel able to speak up if they have concerns which may be relevant to patient safety. This is particularly important for junior and non-medical staff, and so it especially important to respect and value their skills and contribution to the team.<br /><br />Additionally there is both a legal and moral responsibility to ensure that your colleagues have a safe and fair workplace. All doctors are responsible for facilitating this not only to avoid unpleasant behaviour themselves, but also by challenging others who act in a bullying or discriminatory manner. This is important both to comply with laws and policies on equality and diversity, but also to ensure patient safety as bullying and harassment will impair team cohesion and communication.<br /><br /><br /><h5 class='notes-heading'>Communication within and between teams</h5><br />The key message from this part of the guidance is that it is important that it is clear who is responsible for communicating what information both within members of the team, to other teams, and also to patients and carers. Mistakes are often made when team members assume that someone else will have passed on the relevant information and no one ends up doing it. Therefore whenever there is any doubt about whose job it is to pass on certain information, it is obligatory to check.<br /><br />For example, if you expect that the nursing staff would have told you about any allergies the patient has, before prescribing it would be important to confirm with them that they have handed over all the relevant information.<br /><br />Also it is important that teams cooperate more generally, including by having handovers. Proactive steps must be taken to clarify responsibilities and improve communication.<br /><br /><h5 class='notes-heading'>Responsibility and accountability</h5><br />The most important duty of a doctor is to the dignity, safety and care of their patients. Again, it is important for doctors to ensure that it is clear exactly which staff members have which responsibilities, to ensure that these do not 'fall between the cracks' and get missed.<br /><br />It is also important that you make these responsibilities clear to any staff in a team that you are leading.<br /><br />When mistakes happen, it's often the result of system problems. For example it could be under-staffing putting decision making under higher strain, causing more mistakes. This happened in the Bawa-Garba case, the tragic death of a child from unrecognised sepsis on a day where a single doctor was trying to cover multiple wards.<br /><br />Consequently, it is also the responsibility of doctors to engage in setting up and maintaining systems to make sure that risks are appropriately assessed and managed. Doctors are just as accountable for advice they give as a member of a decision making body, as they are for any other medical advice they offer.",
