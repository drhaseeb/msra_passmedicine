You should ask for and respect their views and answer their questions honestly and to the best of your ability. You may also wish to contact the hospital liaison committees established by the Watch Tower Society (the governing body of Jehovah's Witnesses) to support Jehovah's Witnesses faced with treatment decisions involving blood.  These committees can advise on current Society policy regarding the acceptability or otherwise of particular blood products. They also keep details of hospitals and doctors who are experienced in 'bloodless' medical procedures.'</I><br />A blood transfusion is clearly in the patient's best interests and in the scenario described above may potentially be life-saving. Whilst a child cannot refuse treatment they are able to provide consent. Giving the blood transfusion is therefore both clinically and ethically the right course of action. <br /><br />Not giving the blood transfusion not only fails to respect the patient's wishes but also causes potential harm.",

She consents to a blood transfusion but her mother refuses. <br /><br /><b>Rank in order the following actions in response to this situation<br />(1 = Most appropriate; 5 = Least appropriate)</b>",

        "question_notes": "The GMC gives the following guidance:<br /><I>'You should encourage young people to involve their parents in making important decisions, but you should usually abide by any decision they have the capacity to make themselves'</I><br />With respect to Jehovah's witnesses:<br /><I>'You should not make assumptions about the decisions that a Jehovah's Witness patient might make about treatment with blood or blood products. You should ask for and respect their views and answer their questions honestly and to the best of your ability. You may also wish to contact the hospital liaison committees established by the Watch Tower Society (the governing body of Jehovah's Witnesses) to support Jehovah's Witnesses faced with treatment decisions involving blood.  These committees can advise on current Society policy regarding the acceptability or otherwise of particular blood products. They also keep details of hospitals and doctors who are experienced in 'bloodless' medical procedures.'</I><br />A blood transfusion is clearly in the patient's best interests and in the scenario described above may potentially be life-saving. Whilst a child cannot refuse treatment they are able to provide consent. Giving the blood transfusion is therefore both clinically and ethically the right course of action. <br /><br />Not giving the blood transfusion not only fails to respect the patient's wishes but also causes potential harm.",

        "question": "You are a ST1 in the Emergency Department. A famous pop singer ('Danni Domino') has been admitted under your consultant with abdominal pain. Admission bloods show a raised amylase and pancreatitis is suspected. On leaving the hospital a local newspaper reporter stops you and asks you how Danni is doing.  <br /><br /><b>Rank in order the following actions in response to this situation<br />(1 = Most appropriate; 5 = Least appropriate)</b>",
        "correct_answer": "BEADC",
        "question_notes": "The GMC make it very clear:<br /><i>'Patients have a right to expect that information about them will be held in confidence by their doctors. You must treat information about patients as confidential, including after a patient has died.'</i><br /><br />There are no circumstances where you should speak to reporters in such a situation. Advising the reporter to speak to your consultant acknowledges that Danni is in the hospital. Using the opportunity to comment on the dangers of an excessive alcohol intake is completely inappropriate as it gives information about the patient's medical history.<br /><br />Offering to sell patient information is clearly the worst option.",
