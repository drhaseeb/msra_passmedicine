        "title": "GMC: Leadership and management for all doctors - Working with colleagues",
        "body": "As with all aspects of medicine, the fundamental principle remains the same; make the patient your first concern. The purpose of this guidance is to allow the effective functioning of the clinical team to allow patient care to be done safely and smoothly, to the highest standards.<br /><br /><h5 class='notes-heading'>Leadership</h5><br />The recommendations on leadership emphasise the importance of working within a multidisciplinary team. They specifically mention that other team members in leadership positions must be respected. This respect for non-medical staff in leadership roles is important.<br /><br />For example, respecting the advice and leadership of an infection control nurse with regard to hand hygiene is important in making patients are protected from iatrogenic pathogen spread.<br /><br /><h5 class='notes-heading'>Respect for colleagues</h5><br />If a colleague feels like they are not respected and not valued they may not feel able to speak up if they have concerns which may be relevant to patient safety. This is particularly important for junior and non-medical staff, and so it especially important to respect and value their skills and contribution to the team.<br /><br />Additionally there is both a legal and moral responsibility to ensure that your colleagues have a safe and fair workplace. All doctors are responsible for facilitating this not only to avoid unpleasant behaviour themselves, but also by challenging others who act in a bullying or discriminatory manner. This is important both to comply with laws and policies on equality and diversity, but also to ensure patient safety as bullying and harassment will impair team cohesion and communication.<br /><br /><br /><h5 class='notes-heading'>Communication within and between teams</h5><br />The key message from this part of the guidance is that it is important that it is clear who is responsible for communicating what information both within members of the team, to other teams, and also to patients and carers. Mistakes are often made when team members assume that someone else will have passed on the relevant information and no one ends up doing it. Therefore whenever there is any doubt about whose job it is to pass on certain information, it is obligatory to check.<br /><br />For example, if you expect that the nursing staff would have told you about any allergies the patient has, before prescribing it would be important to confirm with them that they have handed over all the relevant information.<br /><br />Also it is important that teams cooperate more generally, including by having handovers. Proactive steps must be taken to clarify responsibilities and improve communication.<br /><br /><h5 class='notes-heading'>Responsibility and accountability</h5><br />The most important duty of a doctor is to the dignity, safety and care of their patients. Again, it is important for doctors to ensure that it is clear exactly which staff members have which responsibilities, to ensure that these do not 'fall between the cracks' and get missed.<br /><br />It is also important that you make these responsibilities clear to any staff in a team that you are leading.<br /><br />When mistakes happen, it's often the result of system problems. For example it could be under-staffing putting decision making under higher strain, causing more mistakes. This happened in the Bawa-Garba case, the tragic death of a child from unrecognised sepsis on a day where a single doctor was trying to cover multiple wards.<br /><br />Consequently, it is also the responsibility of doctors to engage in setting up and maintaining systems to make sure that risks are appropriately assessed and managed. Doctors are just as accountable for advice they give as a member of a decision making body, as they are for any other medical advice they offer.",

The registrar has just finished consenting the patient for a Hartmann's procedure. On leaving the emergency department, a respiratory secretary approaches you. She claims she is the patient's daughter and would like to know what has happened. <br /><br /><b>Rank in order the following actions in response to this situation<br />(1 = Most appropriate; 5 = Least appropriate)</b>",

Here you are just shifting responsibility on to someone else, who may be busy and not have the time currently to speak with the daughter, in a situation which can easily be sorted by yourself hence is ranked lower. <br /><br />E and A are the worst options. E is clearly very unhelpful. Option A breaks patient confidentiality since you haven't gained consent from the patient first and is therefore ranked lowest. ",

The practice manager can subsequently speak to the patient and apologise and explain that it is inappropriate for doctors to have non-professional relationships with their patients.<br /><br />Not speaking to the patient again and blocking her from contacting you will prevent an inappropriate relationship. However, without explaining to the patient why it is inappropriate, it risks her behaving in the same way with future doctors once you have left the practice. Additionally, it could affect how she views medical professionals and result in her diabetic care being affected.<br /><br />Discussing the matter with the practice manager and having her banned is a poor option. A patient with type 2 diabetes is clearly at risk of medical complications and banning her from accessing the practice may result in harm being caused.<br /><br />Accepting her invitation is a poor option. The patient is a vulnerable person and going on holiday with her whilst she is still your patient is unacceptable. Even if you are leaving the practice soon, you still have a duty of care to her and going on holiday with her will affect how she views medical professionals.<br /><br />Inviting her in for a discussion around contraception and testing for sexually transmitted infection (STI) is the worst option. You are using your position as her doctor to influence her into taking contraception and performing tests for an STI for your gain.",

This is to ensure that trust between doctors and patients is maintained.<br /><br />Current patients<br /><ul><li>You must not engage in a sexual or emotionally inappropriate relationship with a patient.</li><li>You must not terminate a professional relationship with a patient in order to pursue a personal relationship.</li></ul><br />Former patients<br /><ul><li>Here the GMC has slightly less hard and fast rules. For former patients, the timing of the professional relationship and the vulnerability of the patient are very important.</li></ul><br />Timing<br /><ul><li>If you have treated a patient for a long time then this is more likely to be inappropriate. </li><li>If your professional relationship with the patient has only just ended then this is more likely to be inappropriate. </li></ul><br />Vulnerability <br /><ul><li>If the patient was vulnerable when you were their doctor, such as young adults and those with mental illness, then it is not appropriate to pursue a relationship with them regardless of the elapsed time. </li><li>If the person is still vulnerable then it is of course not appropriate to pursue a personal relationship with them. </li></ul><br /><h5 class='notes-heading'>Examples</h5><br />You are a GP trainee and you see a patient for one consultation about a minor sporting injury. You then meet this person in the local pub and hit it off. This is likely appropriate as you have not used a position of power or responsibility to further the relationship. <br /><br />You are a GP trainee and have been seeing a patient regularly during your attachment. They have confided in you that their partner is abusive. You have helped them to find support groups and they leave their partner. It would be inappropriate to then start a relationship with this person when your placement ends. <br /><br />The GMC states that serious or repeated failure to abide by these guidelines will risk your registration. If in doubt consult a colleague or your defence union.",
