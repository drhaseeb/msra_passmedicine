            "In order to have effective discussions with patients about risk when obtaining consent for a procedure, you must identify the adverse outcomes that may result from the proposed options. This includes the potential outcome of taking no action. Risks will usually be side effects, complications, and failure of an intervention to achieve the desired aim. Risks can vary from common but minor side effects, to rare but serious adverse outcomes possibly resulting in permanent disability or death.<br /><br />If a patient does not want to know in detail about the treatment, you should respect their wishes, as far as possible. But you must still give them the information they need in order to give their consent to the proposed treatment. This is likely to include what the treatment aims to achieve and what it will involve, for example: whether the procedure is invasive; what level of pain or discomfort they might experience, and what can be done to minimise it; anything they should do to prepare for the treatment; and if it involves any serious risks.<br /><br />If a patient insists that they do not want even this basic information, you must explain the potential consequences of them not having it, particularly if it might mean that their consent is not valid (B). You must record the fact that the patient has declined this information. You must also make it clear that they can change their mind and have more information at any time.<br /><br />Once you have warned them that you may not be able to obtain valid consent, you should go on to give the vital information in option C. Documentation is very important in tricky situations such as this, hence why (A) is the next best option.
