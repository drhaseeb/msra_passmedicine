        "body": "Communication, partnership and teamwork form one of the four domains listed in the Good Medical Practice. This domain focuses on the standards expected of doctors in areas such as communication and collaboration with patients and colleagues.<br /><br />Effective communication<br /><ul><li>Listen to patients and answer any questions honestly</li><li>Ensure that information is delivered in a manner that can be understood. Identify and apply practical measures to overcome any communication and language barriers</li><li>Provide support and information to patients' relatives or carers in a considerate manner</li><li>Doctors on duty need to be easily reachable by their patients and colleagues for any advice or support </li></ul><br />Partnership with patients<br /><ul><li>Empower patients with the information required for patients to make decisions with regards to their care. This includes information on the clinical conditions, treatment options and the relevant risks and uncertainties</li><li>Ensure that patients are aware of the progress of their care</li><li>The roles and responsibilities of each member of the team need to be made clear to the patients</li><li>Patient confidentiality needs to be maintained, even after the patient is deceased </li></ul><br />Fair and respectful care of all patients<br /><ul><li>Respect patients' dignity and privacy </li><li>Respect any health, cultural and religious beliefs held by the patients, even if they do not agree with yours. </li></ul><br />If you have a conscientious objection to a particular procedure e.g. abortion, you need to:<br /><ul><li>Inform the patient that they have the right to see another practitioner</li><li>Provide the necessary information and support towards the patient seeking another doctor. In doing so, refrain from expressing disapproval of the patient's lifestyle, choices or beliefs</li><li>Find another doctor to substitute you if it is not practical for the patient to arrange to see another doctor</li></ul><br />Partnership with colleagues<br /><ul><li>Doctors are expected to work in a team in a manner that serves patients' best interest</li><li>It is important to respect the skills and contributions of every member of the team and be fair to every member of the team </li><li>Understand that your actions may affect others within and outside the team </li><li>It is your duty to complete any post that you have formally accepted as leaving the post assigned to you may compromise patient safety especially if this creates a gap in the medical rota</li><li>Unless the trust has a reasonable time to make adjustments, it is important that you work the hours required of your contract before leaving a job</li></ul><br />Coordination of care between healthcare providers and between health and social care providers. This include <br /><ul><li>Providing all relevant information to all clinicians or social care providers involved in the care of the patients  </li><li>Checking that a named doctor or team has taken over the care </li><li>Ensure that the clinician filling in for you or taking over the care is appropriately trained to provide safe care for the patient </li></ul><br />The Good Medical Practice also made statements with regards to Doctors as teachers. It recommends that doctors support the training and teaching of junior staff members and medical students*. This includes<br /><ul><li>Ensuring adequate supervision</li><li>Writing honest feedback/references/appraisals on their competence, performance and conduct</li><li>Being a mentor</li><li>Supporting those who are struggling with their performance or health</li></ul><br />*In all circumstances, patient safety needs to be prioritised",
