            "The main themes in this scenario are honesty and recognising and working within the levels of your competence. This scenario is difficult to deal with and is something that may well occur whilst working on the wards.<br /><br />The duties of a doctor, as outlined by the GMC, are as follows:<br /><br />Knowledge, skills and performance<br /><ul><li>Make the care of your patient your first concern.</li><li>Provide a good standard of practice and care. </li><li>Keep your professional knowledge and skills up to date.</li><li>Recognise and work within the limits of your competence. </li></ul><br />Safety and quality<br /><ul><li>Take prompt action if you think that patient safety, dignity or comfort is being compromised.</li><li>Protect and promote the health of patients and the public.</li></ul><br />Communication, partnership and teamwork<br /><ul><li>Treat patients as individuals and respect their dignity.</li><li>Treat patients politely and considerately. </li><li>Respect patients' right to confidentiality.</li><li>Work in partnership with patients.</li><li>Listen to, and respond to, their concerns and preferences.</li><li>Give patients the information they want or need in a way they can understand. </li><li>Respect patients' right to reach decisions with you about their treatment and care. </li><li>Support patients in caring for themselves to improve and maintain their health.</li><li>Work with colleagues in the ways that best serve patients' interests.</li></ul><br />Maintaining trust<br /><ul><li>Be honest and open and act with integrity.</li><li>Never discriminate unfairly against patients or colleagues.</li><li>Never abuse your patients' trust in you or the public's trust in the profession.</li></ul><br />Keeping these qualities in mind, the most appropriate answer in this scenario is telling the patient that the team is investigating and that a senior colleague will come and speak with them when we know more (option 4). This is both being open and honest with the patient, as the team do not as yet have a definitive diagnosis, and also recognising the limitations of your abilities in saying that a senior member of the team will come and speak with them. As an ST1 doctor you may not have the necessary knowledge to speak about this patient's potential diagnosis and treatment plans. <br /><br />The next most appropriate option is option 1, telling the patient that the team is currently investigating and that you will speak with them when you know more. This isn't as preferable as option 4, as you haven't recognised the potential limitations of your knowledge and may find yourself in a difficult situation with a patient asking questions for which you do not know the answers. However, this is more appropriate than option 3, speaking with the patient straight away in a side room, as the diagnosis isn't conclusive yet so telling the patient that he has cancer may actually be incorrect, and by saying that the team is currently investigating you have given yourself time to prepare for the conversation that you will have with the patient, meaning you will be more prepared.<br /><br />Options 5 (telling the patient that he has cancer and that it is highly likely that it is terminal ) and option 2 (telling the patient that the investigations to date have not shown any cause for concern ) are the two worst options. Telling the patient that he has cancer (option 5) may be incorrect, as a definitive diagnosis has not been given as yet. Furthermore, even if the diagnosis is definitive telling the patient that it is highly likely to be terminal is not correct, as this is purely speculation. However, this is still preferable to option 2, in which false hope is given to a patient who likely has a terminal condition. This is misleading and goes against several of the duties of a doctor outlined by the GMC. ",

This scenario is difficult to deal with and is something that may well occur whilst working on the wards.<br /><br />The duties of a doctor, as outlined by the GMC, are as follows:<br /><br />Knowledge, skills and performance<br /><ul><li>Make the care of your patient your first concern.</li><li>Provide a good standard of practice and care. </li><li>Keep your professional knowledge and skills up to date.</li><li>Recognise and work within the limits of your competence. </li></ul><br />Safety and quality<br /><ul><li>Take prompt action if you think that patient safety, dignity or comfort is being compromised.</li><li>Protect and promote the health of patients and the public.</li></ul><br />Communication, partnership and teamwork<br /><ul><li>Treat patients as individuals and respect their dignity.</li><li>Treat patients politely and considerately. </li><li>Respect patients' right to confidentiality.</li><li>Work in partnership with patients.</li><li>Listen to, and respond to, their concerns and preferences.</li><li>Give patients the information they want or need in a way they can understand. </li><li>Respect patients' right to reach decisions with you about their treatment and care. </li><li>Support patients in caring for themselves to improve and maintain their health.</li><li>Work with colleagues in the ways that best serve patients' interests.</li></ul><br />Maintaining trust<br /><ul><li>Be honest and open and act with integrity.</li><li>Never discriminate unfairly against patients or colleagues.</li><li>Never abuse your patients' trust in you or the public's trust in the profession.</li></ul><br />Keeping these qualities in mind, the most appropriate answer in this scenario is telling the patient that the team is investigating and that a senior colleague will come and speak with them when we know more (option 4). This is both being open and honest with the patient, as the team do not as yet have a definitive diagnosis, and also recognising the limitations of your abilities in saying that a senior member of the team will come and speak with them. As an ST1 doctor you may not have the necessary knowledge to speak about this patient's potential diagnosis and treatment plans. <br /><br />The next most appropriate option is option 1, telling the patient that the team is currently investigating and that you will speak with them when you know more. This isn't as preferable as option 4, as you haven't recognised the potential limitations of your knowledge and may find yourself in a difficult situation with a patient asking questions for which you do not know the answers. However, this is more appropriate than option 3, speaking with the patient straight away in a side room, as the diagnosis isn't conclusive yet so telling the patient that he has cancer may actually be incorrect, and by saying that the team is currently investigating you have given yourself time to prepare for the conversation that you will have with the patient, meaning you will be more prepared.<br /><br />Options 5 (telling the patient that he has cancer and that it is highly likely that it is terminal ) and option 2 (telling the patient that the investigations to date have not shown any cause for concern ) are the two worst options. Telling the patient that he has cancer (option 5) may be incorrect, as a definitive diagnosis has not been given as yet. Furthermore, even if the diagnosis is definitive telling the patient that it is highly likely to be terminal is not correct, as this is purely speculation. However, this is still preferable to option 2, in which false hope is given to a patient who likely has a terminal condition. This is misleading and goes against several of the duties of a doctor outlined by the GMC. ",

        "body": "This guidance covers disclosing information in adults; there is separate GMC guidance for children. <br /><br />The GMC highlight the importance of a confidential medical service. However, sometimes patients are unable to protect themselves, and we may need to disclose personal information to protect their health and welfare. <br /><br /><h5 class='notes-heading'>I'm worried that my patient is at risk of harm abuse or neglect- Should I disclose?</h5><br />1) Empower patients- make decisions about how to best move forward in partnership <br /><br />2) If disclosure is required by law- You must disclose, but only the specific requested information, in the manner required by law. Inform your patient of disclosure (unless It would undermine the purpose)<br /><br />3) Some disclosures are permitted but not required by law- these should have a legal basis <br /><br />4) How you act will partly depend on whether this patient has capacity or lacks capacity:<br /><br /><div class=\"table-responsive\"><table class = \"tlarge table table-striped table-bordered\"  data-role=\"table\" id=\"tableid1\" ><thead><tr><th></th><th>Disclosure required by law</th><th>Disclosure not required by law</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td><b>Has capacity</b></td><td>You must disclose</td><td>Requires patient consent (if practicable)- ultimately the patient's decision unless non-disclosure puts others at risk of serious harm/death. If they refuse, find out why, inform them of the risks and refer to support groups</td></tr><tr><td><b>Lacks capacity</b></td><td>You must disclose</td><td>You must disclose to appropriate authority/person (unless not of overall benefit to the patient). Discuss with an experienced colleague and document if you think it's not in the patient's best interest</td></tr></tbody></table></div><br /><h5 class='notes-heading'>Can I share information to protect others/the public?</h5><br />Confidentiality is in the public interest as it benefits society and individuals to seek medical care. However, this must be balanced with protecting and promoting the health of patients and the public. <br /><br /><div class=\"table-responsive\"><table class = \"tlarge table table-striped table-bordered\"  data-role=\"table\" id=\"tableid2\" ><thead><tr><th>Required by law</th><th>Requests for information</th><th>Disclosure not required by law</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>You must disclose e.g. infectious disease notification, provision of social and health care, preventing terrorism and investigation of road traffic accidents.</td><td>Take these seriously if patients pose a risk of serious harm (e.g. violent or sex offenders), and for formal inquiries, inquests and reviews</td><td>Either patient must consent (unless not practicable) or must have a legal basis</td></tr></tbody></table></div>If you have already decided to disclose the information, don't request consent, instead inform them of this intention, unless not safe or practicable.<br /><br /><br /><h5 class='notes-heading'>Deciding if you will disclose regardless of if the patient consents:</h5><br />1. Would non-disclosure put others at risk of death or serious harm? - this may justify disclosure e.g. <br /><ul><li>When a victim of violence doesn't want to inform the police, but the perpetrator still poses a significant risk to others, such as children in domestic violence.</li><li>If someone keeps driving despite being told they are not fit to drive</li><li>A patient has a serious communicable disease but refuses to disclose</li><li>A patient is working despite being unfit for work and this poses a serious risk to others</li></ul><br />2. You should only disclose if you decide that the risk of not disclosing is so serious that it outweighs the patient and public interest in maintaining confidentiality. <br /><br /><div class=\"table-responsive\"><table class = \"tlarge table table-striped table-bordered\"  data-role=\"table\" id=\"tableid3\" ><thead><tr><th>Pro-confidentiality factors</th><th>Pro-disclosure factors</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Harm/distress from disclosing may cause withdrawal from care and poor health</td><td>Harm to others if not disclosed</td></tr><tr><td>Disclosing will reduce overall trust in perception of doctors</td><td>Benefit to others if information disclosed</td></tr></tbody></table></div><br />Think about the nature of the information and what the patient thinks. Can you minimise the breach of the patient's privacy and still avoid harm?<br /><br />Genetic medicine introduces another hurdle in relation to confidentiality, because if your patient Is found to have a genetic condition, this might also suggest a probability of this condition in a relative. Many patients share these results with relatives especially if they know it can help to prevent health problems in their relatives. However, if a patient refuses, it would be just to disclose if non-disclosure would risk death or serious harm in others. Try to not disclose patient identity when advising the others of the risks identified to them.<br /><br />Always document in patient records when disclosing information. Document steps you've taken to seek consent from or inform the patient about the disclosure, or reasons for not doing so. <br /><br />Whether you can disclose without consent can be complex. Before doing so, seek advice from a Caldicott or data guardian who isn't connected to the reason for the disclosure. Keep the patient details anonymous if possible.",

Once it is clear that a patient (young or not) has developed an abnormal interest in a doctor it is inappropriate for the doctor-patient relationship to continue. It is therefore appropriate to ensure you do not see the patient again.<br /><br />The next best option is to ensure you always have a chaperone present in the room. This may help to both prevent inappropriate behaviour and protect you from any claims of improper conduct. <br /><br />Contacting the Child Protection Officer for advice may be appropriate if a younger child was displaying sexual behaviour but would probably not be needed in this scenario. <br /><br />Speaking to the child's mother without permission is breaking confidentiality and should be avoided if at all possible.<br /><br />It is stretching it a bit to describe this child's behaviour as sexual harassment.",

        "question_notes": "It is not uncommon for teenagers to develop crushes on authority figures, classically teachers. This situation needs to be handled delicately. Once it is clear that a patient (young or not) has developed an abnormal interest in a doctor it is inappropriate for the doctor-patient relationship to continue. It is therefore appropriate to ensure you do not see the patient again.<br /><br />The next best option is to ensure you always have a chaperone present in the room. This may help to both prevent inappropriate behaviour and protect you from any claims of improper conduct. <br /><br />Contacting the Child Protection Officer for advice may be appropriate if a younger child was displaying sexual behaviour but would probably not be needed in this scenario. <br /><br />Speaking to the child's mother without permission is breaking confidentiality and should be avoided if at all possible.<br /><br />It is stretching it a bit to describe this child's behaviour as sexual harassment.",
